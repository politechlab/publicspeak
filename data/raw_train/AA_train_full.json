Just to bring you up to date on some things that we're working on. We did not meet in December. We do take December off every year for our meetings, but we have been working hard. We have reestablished our subcommittees.  And those groups are starting to gather. So at our January meeting, you'll be hearing updates from those committees. At the forefront will be community outreach. That's a big goal we've set for this coming year is to further our outreach within the community, going to various events and really putting ourselves out there to hear what the community feels and what they would like in a police department. And also, we will continue regular meetings with the police officers themselves.  We do have quite a few positions open. So if anyone is in the community and interested in learning more about civilian police oversight, if that interests them, we invite them to attend our next commission meeting, which will be here in the council chambers on January 24th at 6 p.m. One of the things we've noticed over the last few weeks is people we've met, and this does have something to do with our outreach  They don't know necessarily who we are and what we do. So I thought I would take this opportunity to review that. So we are an independent commission that functions as a body to review the actions and policies of the Ann Arbor Police Department. Therefore, such programs as unarmed response or the new solutions connections group are not part of our charge. That's not something we oversee under the ordinance that governs us.  While we do work closely with those groups, we're not responsible for their oversight. In addition, we do not have decision-making authority over the police department. So what we could do is we can look at their policies, such as use of force,  and work with them to make changes or recommendations. But we don't necessarily have the authority to make decisions. Those decisions and responsibilities lie with the chief of police and their immediate boss, which is the city administrator. One of the committees that we do have is the information manager group.  And that is the group that reviews complaints and investigation reports regarding officer actions. By our ordinance, there's five information managers. The way that works is a complaint comes in, the police department, through their professional standards, does the review and investigation and makes a recommendation. Once it's all done and we get through the grievance process per the union contract and so on, then it is forwarded to ICPOC to do another review.  And we are able to either concur with the police actions or recommendations or discipline, or we are able to give them recommendations and explain what our feelings were and how we think it should change in the future. Over the last few weeks, we have been made aware, we've received one email regarding the recent allegations against the police regarding sweeps around the Delana Center.  At this time, we were not provided enough specific information to determine if any of these allegations actually occurred. We have responded to the email and requested the complainant if they could provide us any further information regarding the incidents, and these would help us be able to do a further review. These are such things as times, dates, officer names, patrol car numbers, photographs, anything like that.  And then we can pinpoint times and dates for many of those things. We are currently awaiting the information from the complainant. Once we do have more information, we will continue to review the matter. If any of you receive further information, such as those specifics, please forward them to us. That's why we're here. And so we'll continue forward with that.  At the same time, we also received a separate complaint from a group that did have more specific information that we're able to review. The complaint includes an allegation that an officer was not doing their job entirely when they did not arrest someone when individuals felt harassed and unsafe in a nonviolent situation. As with all complaints, this one was forwarded to the police department for investigation, and part of the process, once it's done, it'll come to us for further review.  Because these complaints are very different regarding the officer behavior, we are happy to keep counsel up to date on the matter. So feel free to contact us in any way and we'll let you know what our status is on it. So again, thank you for your time and we do appreciate being able to update you every month.

Good evening. Casey Klein, 3304 North Timberwood Drive, Traverse City, Michigan 49686. I would like to address agenda item C1 regarding the proposed new development at 530 North Division Street, which would include the removal of the 3,000 square foot structure to be replaced with an 8,000 square foot recertified structure.  I grew up next door at 524 North Division Street, where my family continues to be stewards of this historic property today. One of the responsibilities of the city is to set and maintain standards, and this project falls well outside the current standards. When a variance is allowed, it sets a precedent. If the city's intent is to start changing this neighborhood, then those changes should be a part of a larger master plan and approved by the citizen.  not piecemeal together as will happen if this proposal moves forward without substantial modifications. During the Planning Commission meeting, I heard one of the commissioners ask about adding a maximum setback  and another about adding restrictions for maximum height. That only added to my concern that there is no clear or set plan moving forward in this neighborhood. I believe the proposed construction should be at a minimum contained to the existing footprint, if not in total size, scale, and historical exterior finishes, in order to maintain the characteristics of this unique neighborhood.  The only thing to be gained by building a structure as large as what is proposed is to make money, and that is not the city's responsibility to ensure that that happens. New construction within the existing footprint would be a win-win in my eyes, as it would maintain the current look and feel of the neighborhood, could still achieve the goals of LEED certification, and be designed for more dense occupancy. Even when a project checks all the boxes,  It does not always mean it is the right thing to do. The Old Fourth Ward was not developed at an energy-saving district, but a historical one, and future planning for this area should take that into consideration. During a previous Planning Commission meeting, I heard Mr. Shelby acknowledge the history of the neighborhood and noted no Native American presence in this area. If the proposal moves forward without substantial modification to the footprint, please consider requiring an archeological survey of the site prior to development.  This neighborhood is one area close to downtown that is protected from university development. Every time I pass the corner where the Flimsy Burger location used to be, my heart sinks a little. I miss the quaint gateways downtown. The looming building that replaced this structure, which contributed to that faint feeling, does not fit the site and look out of place. While it is beautifully designed, it does not fit the site or characteristics adjacent to it.  While that structure is much larger than what's proposed by 30 Division Street, it gives an example of the way that one structure can change the entire look and feel of an area. Thank you for your time and consideration.", "start": 593.749, "end": 779.553, "Transition": "\"\"", "Meeting Section": "Public Comment", "Speaker Role": "Commenter", "is_public_comment": 1, "is_public_hearing": 0, "is_comment_start_trigger": 0, "is_comment_end_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_start_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_end_trigger": 0}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_11", "text": "Thank you.

For 40 years, I've owned the property adjacent to and south of the 530 development. I lived at the property for eight years and started my family there and would like to return to live there sometime. I ask that the PUD not be granted.  I think it is clear that if an 8,000 square foot house can be net zero, then a 4,000 square house with the same solar footprint will also be net zero and meet the city's energy and density goals. Mr. Shelby claims to be a builder, carpenter, and landlord and has owned for 45 years.  for 20 years, the 3,333 square foot building at 530 North Division Street. I think Mr. Shelby describes the building as collapsing. It appears that the structure will end up in the landfill. I don't think the city should award a landlord that fails to maintain his building with a PUD.  Also, what are the consequences if energy predictions don't materialize? Will the city triple his property taxes? Will he be made to remove one of the units for the structure in compliance then with RC4 zoning? Or will he just pass the extra energy cost on to tenants and laugh all the way to the bank with his  140% increase in profit. I am unaware that private businesses under any obligation to share accurate energy information with the city or anyone.  Private businesses, to my knowledge, are not under the Freedom of Information Act. Likewise, I do not think he's under any obligation to install any energy savings equipment in the building. And if it is not available or is too expensive at the time of construction, or keep it maintained once installed, he can just pass the high energy costs on to the tenants.  I bought into RC4 zoning 40 years ago and I do not want those rights stolen from me when this new building, this new house is built. I ask that you deny the PUD.

Dan Adams, 1016 Daniel Street. I'm here to talk about the library lot. Four years ago, a small group of anti-development activists called Library Green successfully amended the city's charter to preserve a downtown parking lot forever as a park. They promised the public that they would do this privately. It would be a project privately led, privately funded, and that it would be completed by the city's bicentennial.  The city has given Library Green a fair and full opportunity to deliver on what it said it was going to do. Four years to raise money, privileged access to council and staff, a city-funded task force, a dedicated advisory commission that exists entirely separate from the Parks Department, and critically, hundreds of thousands of dollars in city budget allocations. Few citizen-led,  Projects enjoy this kind of city support, and few organizations could have wasted that support more comprehensively. They haven't raised the money. They don't have a plan to do it. They haven't demonstrated to voters that they are capable of executing their vision or making any significant progress on that vision on any reasonable time scale, short-term, medium-term, long-term. The politics of housing and land use in Ann Arbor since the passage of Proposal A have shifted dramatically.  In the last two cycles, we've seen voters comprehensively reject the exclusionary anti-housing agenda that animated Proposal A's passage. Every council member who supported significant resource diversion to the project has lost their seat. Every year that goes by, under the status quo, they will continue to parasitically drain and waste staff time and resources,  They will cause the city and private organizations like Peter Allen's EA2, who's sitting behind me, they'll have to plan around this fiction. And the city, critically, is going to continue to lose millions of dollars in tax revenue, hundreds of units of housing, tens of millions of dollars in grants. Tomorrow I'm going to email all of you a draft resolution. It doesn't repeal Proposal A. It replaces it.  with a charter codified commitment to invest whatever we reap from the sale of that property to advance community consensus policy goals, to help the city. It also requires any purchaser that would come along to create and maintain the plaza that we were promised, the plaza that we would have today, absent the intervention of Library Green.  I'm speaking you tonight because I'm independently passionate about this issue. I was a taxpayer. I was a resident. I was not involved in city politics. This is something that really drew me in because of how indefensible and shocking it was. I believe it's time to ask voters this year, 2023, whether they want to continue throwing good money after bad.

Adam Goodman joining from Ward 5.  So this past Friday, the Ann Arbor Fire Department reported in a social media post that a pedestrian was struck on Jackson Avenue in front of Veterans Park and had been in critical condition after that. So I haven't seen, I don't think we have a full accounting of exactly what happened just yet, but I've been dreading this sort of situation for some time.  In fact, I spoke to council about pedestrian safety on Jackson Avenue back in September, and I said it was inevitable that somebody would be hurt or worse. I hate that I was apparently correct about this. I hate it. But here we are. So this location, Jackson, with Betts Park on one side and Burwood Avenue on the other, it's a high demand spot for pedestrian crossing across Jackson Avenue.  It connects a neighborhood to one of our city's premier parks, but there's no marked crosswalk no safe way to cross the street there. In fact, this is part of a stretch of Jackson Avenue over two thirds of a mile long without a single marked crosswalk without a single safe place to cross, even though there are bus stops all along here neighborhoods, there's convenience stores and of course there's parks so  You know, folks in the neighborhood along Jackson, and city staff too, to their credit, have actually been working for years to try to get some mid-block crosswalks added here, at least ever since the road diet was completed in 2015 on Jackson, if not for a lot longer before then. But so far, nothing's happened, because this is a state trumpline owned by the Michigan Department of Transportation, and MDOT just doesn't seem to care about anything except free-flowing car traffic, at least not until people die.  Adding a few crosswalks is the least they could do to improve pedestrian safety and access in this city, but they haven't done it for at least eight years now when people have been asking them for it. Now, I know this sort of situation is why the city is running a study looking at possibly taking control over these state routes. But the outcome of that study isn't a foregone conclusion, and it really won't come soon enough in any case. We need MDOT to add safe crossings on Jackson and West Huron  Now, immediately, as we have just seen, every moment of delay puts our neighbors and our community at further risk. You know, enough is enough.  So tonight, I'm speaking to you. I'm in a slightly weird position where I'm asking city council to take action on a problem, even though I know that you don't really have authority over it. Sorry about that. But still, I hope you will do everything you can to convince MDOT to finally solve this problem and to do so without delay. And I will also do what I can to contact them directly. And I hope everyone in the community who's watching this who cares about this issue will do the same.

Don't even pretend you're progressive unless you say something about that. Beware of hitching your wagon to the violent, racist state of Israel.

First,  Congratulations and respect to the powerful people of Iran who are fighting for human rights and dignity every night. I am with you. People of conscience are with you.

I have been coming to human rights commissions in Ann Arbor, to city council in Ann Arbor, demanding human rights and human dignity for people of Palestine, who are the target of U.S. military aid to Israel. They've been getting killed by Israeli military day in and day out.  Just about every day for the past 30, 40, 50, 60 years, Palestinians have been getting killed. I've been coming here demanding human rights for Palestinian people. When I first arrived in Ann Arbor, I really thought this was a progressive group because they had a human rights commission. And me and multiple people like myself, we went to their meetings and we pushed them to pass this resolution, which Blaine just talked about.  pass a resolution against human, against military aid to Israel. And finally in December, January of 2004, they did pass that resolution and it made it into the media. You have a copy of it to look at. I invite all of you to look at it and read it carefully. They passed that resolution. That resolution never made it to the tables of this  fantabulous city council and those like it, it never made it to them to vote on it. Because what happened is that corruption and Zionist lobby in this town won. And they stopped it from getting into the hands of the Ann Arbor City Council members.  It is time that you vote on that. Instead of voting on that resolution, Ann Arbor City Council replaced the commissioner's chairperson, eliminated its staff, and changed its staff so that they would vote the right way, the way of Zionist pigs in this town.  I am asking you again, those of you who have just arrived, you have the chance to do the right thing.

Professor Growick made a huge difference on me, so much so that I stayed in Ann Arbor to pursue my real estate career and raise my family, having fallen in love with its walkable urbanity, nearby parks, and the amazing Huron River. I started teaching real estate development at the University in 1980 as a side pursuit to my development. I retired last winter from teaching over 40 years and 4,000 students, including Jeff Gahan, Lisa Suave, Wanwu Li, Hilary Hansel to name just a few of those at City Hall.  One of my best and last students, Sarah Lorenz, and I co-founded a non-profit, Equitable Ann Arbor Land Trust in 2019 to offer creative and bold housing solutions due to Ann Arbor's lack of housing at all the middle and lower price points. Here are EA2's recommendations. First, step for step, expand park land uses and activities near the riverfront.  expand the new 22 million dollar funded Lowertown Riverfront Conservancy to help with new passive active cultural recreational  and educational opportunities. Open the river views by culling all the invasives. Expand the bike and walking trails out into the nearby neighborhoods along the creek sheds. Enhance and transform the 2.5 mile stretch of river into the defining characteristic of Ann Arbor, as renowned as the big house is to the university. Use the river to stitch together the town and gown. Make this new riverfront a birthday present to our citizens for the next 200 years.  Step two, motivate the city and university to transform their well-located service parking lots into mixed-use housing over retail. Place these public sites into community land trusts with 99-year leases. Develop them with affordable workforce and market rate housing for sale rather than rental wherever possible.  Local retail and new parking would be added where necessary. The eight large parking lots for the housing solution are all located within the five oxbows from Argo Pond to the Arboretum. Can you imagine where any of them are? Two sites are owned by the city. The rest are mostly owned by the university.  Tonight, I'd like to introduce six talented U of M seniors and their faculty advisor, Christina Eckhoff. Stand up, folks. They will all be doing their three-credit capstone class this term to help the EA2 unravel the details and complexities for our agenda. This capstone team will be researching best practices across the country on how to promote Ann Arbor's riverfront renaissance.  This will be for a fully explained article by Ryan Stanton later on this week. Thank you very much. I've got a handout for each of you as well. Appreciate it.

Excuse me. I wanted to let people know about the Get Downtown, Conquer the Winter Challenge that starts tomorrow and runs through February 10th. This is meant to reward travel by alternate modes of transit, including bus, bike, carpool, walking, rolling, scooters, telecommuting.  A number of council members are participating in this. On a related note, we've had several members of our community reach out to us about concerns about people parking or using protected bike lanes as a parking or a loading zone.  So it's really important that as we build out this network, we keep it safe for the cyclists it's intended for. And I wanted to let people know that I'm working on solutions to this with staff. One of the things is that Ann Arbor police has let us know that they're working on stepping up enforcement. Another thing that they're doing is they're tracking the citations more precisely now than they were before. So before parking violations were lumped together, now they're going to track these separately. So we'll have data.  to get a grasp on current enforcement. A big part of this also, though, is just how the lanes are designed. And there we have somewhat of an obstacle, excuse the pun, where we can't put in the number of vertical delineators that we need to because we don't have the appropriate plowing and road cleaning equipment.  On that note, I wanted to draw my colleagues' attention to a memo that was actually included in the last council meeting materials, and this was a resolution that was passed by the Transportation Commission. It directs council to work with the city administrator and the appropriate staff to determine who's responsible for the acquisition, operation, and maintenance of the snow plows and street sweepers for these narrower lanes, and to also consider this in the upcoming budget cycle.

I hope you've had a chance to look at the material in your packet that we sent you, the statement we sent you. I'll touch on a few items in that. We think that the maps that were taken out of that plan, taken out of the 2016 plan, in the current plan, need to be either reinstated in the plan or carried forward in some fashion.  Because they show what exists in terms of the Huron River Greenway, the border-to-border trail links, what exists, what needs to be filled, what gaps need to be filled. These have been longstanding plans, and the maps help clarify that. One picture is worth 1,000 words, we think, on conveying the concept.  Having the maps in there will help with funding applications, I think. One example of the things that are needed are in the vicinity of the Fuller Maiden Lane intersection, where we have a mess right now, long planned trail systems. The bridges in that area were built with pads underneath, concrete pads to link the trails. And the border board trail is supposed to go under one of those. Those haven't been built in the last 40 years since the bridges were rebuilt back in the 1980s. This needs to be moved forward.  This concept was also in the 2006 non-motorized transportation plan, and city council reinforced the concept back in 2015 resolution.  The Greenway system, the park system in the valley, is really a jewel of Ann Arbor's park system, and many minds have gone into creating that concept. Now, you may have seen in our material that there's a timing problem, because the parks department needs to submit an approved plan to DNR in order to be able to submit grant proposals. So unless you can figure out a way around this, there may not be time to get the maps into the plan right now.  You may have no choice but to adopt the plan as is, but we think that it's important for the city council to adopt those maps as ongoing city policy until there's time to incorporate them, either amend them into the plan or create a new plan. And also to direct the park staff to any future amendment to the plan or future plans to incorporate those maps.  Just a comment as an individual. There's this issue of what's transportation, what's recreation, how to get the departments working together. Because there's really, this crosses both boundaries. And we need to figure out how to.  get people working together to implement these things. Having those maps out of the plan makes it difficult for us to see where we're going. We need a vision of where we're going, make it easy for people to see, and then figure out how to get departments playing together, together with outside funding agencies, to make these important projects happen.

These amendments that we propose to make to the stormwater section of the UDC, the Unified Development Code, were prompted by a review letter that the city received from the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy.  This is part of the process of qualifying for our National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit, which we have to do. It's required under the Federal Clean Water Act. EGLE raised issues with our storm water management system requirements. We use the rules of Washtenaw County Water Resources Commissioner as our storm water design standards, so that's not the problem. But we had several, four, in fact, exemptions.  that are not allowable. So we had exempted site plans on parcels one acre or greater from first flush volume. That's the first one inch of runoff. It's the worst, most polluted inch of rainwater that happens in a storm. We exempted that when impervious area was not being increased. We exempted impervious area that was being used solely for ADA requirements improvements. We exempted impervious area that was for public sidewalk improvements.  And we had exempted existing impervious area on historic structures from stormwater management. OK, we're not going to do that anymore. OK, that was probably too much in the weeds. And when we were reviewing all of that, you know when you start weeding, you just keep going.  We wanted to propose a change to the alternative method of stormwater detention section of the UDC, which has been used precisely once since it was added 20 years ago. And I will not go into detail on that, but suffice it to say that there will be more staff flexibility when site constraints make it.  difficult or limit how much stormwater work you can do, but we will thoroughly oversee that. You may have noticed that we received one late amendment to this item, and this was truly minor, a small change in language from review responsibility rather than jurisdiction.

Can everyone see that fully?  All right, so the PROS plan, just a brief overview of what this is. This is our comprehensive plan for the park system with a look five years ahead and also longer range. So one of the reasons we update this regularly is that the Michigan Department of Natural Resources requires us to file a PROS plan or REC plan with them every five years in order to maintain eligibility for their grant funding.  But it's also a great opportunity for us to ensure that this still reflects public values and desires of the community. So it provides this forum for public input through a variety of ways. It also outlines needs and desires for existing and future facilities.  And so just to give you an overview of the level of community engagement that this plan has undertaken, we started with an online survey last spring where we had over nearly 2,400 respondents. So this was, I think, nearly double what the previous PROSE plan was. So we were really excited about that. There was a task force guiding the survey rollout as well as the survey development.  and a lot of thought was put into how we could reach a broader audience. In addition to the online survey, we met with several focus groups, Park Advisory Commission, Recreation Advisory Commission, Planning Commission, as well as the Office of Sustainability, and two focus groups on relevant issues. So one focused on downtown parks, and then another one focused on bike recreation.  In addition to that, we held two separate public meetings, one virtual, one in person. And of course, we've received several email comments throughout this process. We also, by law, are required to have a 42-day open review period, which took place this November into December 23rd.  And so with this public comment period, we actually shared a preliminary draft of the PROS plan with PAC and Planning Commission back in October. We had a draft plan that was posted on the park planning website back on October 13th that was available for public review. On November 11th, City Council approved the formal distribution of the PROS plan.  and began this formal 42-day public comment period that ended near the end of the year. But there was a long time where we had opportunities for the community to weigh in on this and several opportunities basically throughout the past year.  And so here we are today. This is kind of the final step in getting our approvals before we can submit to the DNR by the end of January. So we had a special meeting with the Park Advisory Commission on the 3rd. They recommended it for adoption. We had a Planning Commission public hearing on January 4th, who has also recommended it for City Council adoption. So here we are today with you.  And some of the themes of the public comments that we've been hearing, a lot centered around center of the city. I know we had a public comment earlier. We received a statement from the Council of the Commons, as well as from individual comments from members of the community. A lot of discussion around including census data breakdown by different planning areas of the city, having the document show strong support.  and also clarifying funding responsibility of the Council of the Commons or Park Advisory Commission or Parks Department.  We had several requests for dark skies compliant lighting practices to be included, requests for new amenities improvements. Some of these were for specific parks, others were from neighborhood associations or other informal groups. And then other miscellaneous public input we had around these Huron River Greenway plans you had mentioned earlier, the existing railroad barriers throughout the city and how those affect non-motorized transportation.  as well as sustainability. At the January 3rd Park Advisory Commission meeting, the plan was recommended for approval, but with a few language adjustments. We consolidated discussion around the center of the city from being in two locations in the plan to just one location on page 52. We expanded a description of the center of the city to include the specific charter language,  That's also included on page 52. And then we made an adjustment to the sentence you see below to clarify that the Council of the Commons is responsible for recommendations on design, usage, and funding for the library lane lot portion of the center of the city, while Liberty Plaza and the Kemp House remain under the jurisdiction of the Ann Arbor Parks and Recreation. So that was something that came out of PAC on the 3rd.  And so with that, we just wanted to give an overview of kind of how we got to this point, but happy to take any questions any of you may have.

We believe that there's an opportunity for us to meet regularly with those maps as a question to figure out how they are.

As a parent, I couldn't agree strongly with the sentiment that came out of the public comment period and survey period around existing and improving our playgrounds. There's definitely playgrounds in our town that are great and some that are lacking, and to bring them all up to a standard  have a difficult choice as to what playground to go to as a parent would be a really good problem to have. And I'm incredibly interested in the feedback that came back regarding the border to border trail and making sure that we have connectivity so that trails don't just end and we're dumped out into a street where we have to continue our commute to the next connection point.

The four contracts described in my email illustrate how flawed implementation of our best value policy has already potentially wasted almost $1.6 million in just eight months.  over competing qualified lower bids and appears to have chilled competitive bidding. This is real money. Failure to ask hard questions would be the height of fiscal irresponsibility. Ask yourself this, what are we getting for that $1.6 million? I recognize the community voted to approve best value. I had mixed feelings about it then and unfortunately it looks like some problems raised then have now occurred. It's your responsibility to deal with them. Look at the CA Hall contract. It's $755,000, three quarters of a million.  Higher than the low bid. Staff's using a five-factor scoring system for awarding contracts. I'll leave aside for now the issue of weighting items like worker development equally with cost and qualifications. Let's look at the detail. TA Hall scored 83, the lower bidder 80. That small scoring difference was a four-point difference in social equity and sustainability.  Ask this, what was that based on? Then ask, what are we getting for that $755,000? There might be good answers, but those questions need to be asked. Next, look at the August 837,000 AZ-SHMINA contract, 279,000 higher, 50% higher than the low bid. AZ scored 74, the other bidder 67.

On the Bailey contracts, unlike the typical multiple bids on large contracts of this type, this time Bailey was the only bidder. Last year, if you remember, Council Members Iyer and Rodina twice convinced you  to override staff recommendations to hire lower bidders in favor of Bailey. Two well-established local contractors with lots of past city jobs have said since they might not even spend the time and dollars working up bids if this process like that continues to be used. I can't blame them. And now it looks like no one wants to even compete with Bailey. So it appears in less than a year, implementation of best value has resulted in potential  much higher bids, $1.6 million, $2.5 million on an annual basis, and has completely eliminated competitive bidding of the work that Bailey likes to do.

The Robert and Irma Hayden House Historic District Study Committee finds that the proposed Historic District, Robert and Irma Hayden House Historic District, sounds redundant, has significant under National Register of Historic Places, Criterion B, as it illustrates the lives of persons significant in our past within a local, state, or national historic context.  I support this and hope that you'll vote in favor of this. We do have some other single resource districts within our city, Northern Brewery, Cobblestone Farm come to mind. This is a wonderful way to recognize, not just preserve, but recognize architecture and people and the history of our community. We have our bicentennial coming up in 2024. So I'm hoping that there'll be some other recognition similar to this  that will be highlighted as part of that as well. And by the way, I was on the Historic District Commission for six years, Chair for two, and on the Board of Cobblestone Farm for two years. So I speak from that perspective, but I speak here supporting this as an individual person.  I'd also like to thank the last caller for their remarks on that particular item. I believe two items, maybe. And I also want to speak about CA9. And I suggest that you pull this for discussion from the consent agenda. I'm not against it, but I think the discussion of it would be valuable to everybody. We have a $2 million contribution to the Affordable Housing Fund as part of the TUD, and they're looking  actually have 15 units on site, which would be the right math, I'm guessing. And the question is, as a community, what do we prefer? Do we prefer to have the units on site when we have these type of developments, or do we prefer the money paid in lieu?

She was involved in biking, not the Hell's Angel type, but in biking. She was a runner. She was a camper. She was a cook. She was a traveler. She was a mother and a wife and an academic, having completed her master's and was working on her PhD.  But as it said, if you want a job to get done, give it to a busy person. And we did. And I'm very glad that we did.

Because the same students passed resolutions saying no more money for Israel. The same students have been coming here demanding  something to be done about this apartheid state of Israel.

I'm speaking as an individual tonight. I'm on the board of Walk Like Washtenaw, but we haven't had a time to put together an organizational statement on your latest proposals before you tonight.  It's been interesting to follow the progress of this project, the sad progress over the last year. Walk Like Washington has tried to represent the public interest and tried to represent what's in Ann Arbor's and the university's non-motorized transportation plans and carbon neutrality plans. So far we haven't been successful, but we hope to be. The earlier statement, I hope you had a chance to look at what I sent you earlier today.  The WBWC statement from about a year ago talked about what's needed. Widening the west sidewalk on the bridge by about five feet and building the long planned trail loop under the bridge. Widening the sidewalk would allow room for bi-directional bike lanes and a pedestrian lane as an important part of a campus-to-campus bike route if we ever want to make a safe route between the campuses for biking.  However, a council by a 65 vote about a year ago directed the designer to proceed with a bad design, which would actually narrow the west sidewalk from 10.5 feet to 8 feet. Now you've been presented with a proposal which, as I understand it, would narrow it from 10.5 feet to 10 feet. So it's less bad, but it's still not good. And it's not what's needed.  One thing that I'm confused about in the proposal before you is the cost issue. It would authorize $2 million to widen the bridge by two feet, as I understand it. We were told about a year ago that it was estimated to cost about half a million dollars to widen it by five feet because of the need for an extra support beam. So it seems odd that we'd be paying more for less, paying three times as much for  or four times as much for less than half as much widening. So that ought to be clarified, what the issue with the cost is there. Also before you, as I understand it, the city would be paying the first 500,000, first half million, and then the university would pick up any additional one and a half million up to $2 million. If that's right, and if it turns out that the cost is only about a half million, then the city has been taken to the cleaners on this deal. I think you ought to look into that cost issue.  You know, we're on the verge of making a $10 million mistake on a long-term investment here when really we should do it right. And if we can't do the bridge right on a long-term investment like this, we should reject this proposal until we can do the design right and build it right.

So we do not have a good answer to that at this moment. Second question, can the signs that are currently placed on the sidewalks  instead be situated on the exterior walls of the bridge? Answer to that is yes, and the current design does accommodate that. Third question, how can we ensure that the new design follows best practices for traffic calming and Vision Zero principles? The previous mention of split lanes, for example, is concerning. In response to that, I would say that the design that we will undertake here  presuming that this is passed, will be reviewed by the city transportation staff and shared as well with the Transportation Commission for their feedback. The current design, as well as any future designs for the bridge, would not include any slip lanes. Fourth question, how can we ensure that the widening stops here, i.e., doesn't continue into the intersection and road beyond?  If any widening of the Fuller East Medical Center Drive intersection were to be considered in the future, it would be addressed as part of the capital improvement project for that intersection. And that project is currently listed as on hold in the recently approved CIP. And then finally, how are width dimensions arrived at?  The width of the bridge was determined based on adding a single 11 foot wide lane and maintaining the existing 11 foot wide travel lanes as well. And then a redistribution of the existing 10 and a half foot sidewalks to create the wider shared use facility that the design currently shows on the east side of the bridge. That's all the questions we received most recently and myself and staff will be  here and available to answer any further questions.

Additional construction cost is estimated around $850,000 now.  as opposed to $500,000 last year, which we're seeing construction costs increase each year. So that makes sense.

I just want to express my gratitude for our ability to be able to have this conversation productively tonight. At least for me, this was one of our more difficult decisions that we've made during my time on council because we were trying to weigh our city's transportation and safety goals with what we were being told by one of the most important health systems in the state was a need of theirs as well.  And I don't think any of us, unfortunately, regardless of which side we voted on when this came up last time, are particularly happy with the outcome. And I've acknowledged this before, you know, we are always at a bit of a negotiating disadvantage with the university because  of our position and our nature as a public body and our adherence to the Open Meetings Act and all of the things that require us to have our deliberations here at this table while they can negotiate with us, not necessarily in that way.  In the interim here, I know that many of us have continued having conversations with campus and community partners. And since we've discussed this last, there have been a lot of new people added to the conversation. And so, you know, we have five new people sitting here at this table. We have a new university president who had expressed his desire to strengthen our town-gown partnership.  We have a new chair of the Board of Regents who lives here in Ann Arbor. And so, you know, I know many of us have had conversations with members of the Board of Regents. I just want to actually thank Regent Brown, who I've spoken with several times over the last couple of weeks, for his willingness to support our coming back to the table and finding additional resources, and for staff for pulling this proposal together.  I agree with with Councilmember Briggs that this is an improvement. I think there are still some questions. I do have one more as well. I know that these are cost estimates right now because we have  um we still have to do some of this this design work and and i'm looking at the resolution and it seems pretty black and white on what we are approving in terms of width and um and also cost and i guess you know i i've heard mr hutchinson i think you said that that we could potentially you know move that back to 10.5 feet or we still have the ability to add some additional um  Are we approving, do we need to potentially modify this language to say at least? Are we approving a cost estimate here? Are we approving 10 feet and 13 feet specifically? That's how it reads as I'm reading it. And if we were to go back to doing these estimates and it comes in under,  I would love for us to add additional width to that sidewalk as well, beyond even 10.5 feet.

The staff resolution, as I see it, is an important incremental improvement that goes a significant way in addressing one of the primary concerns raised by the Transportation Commission, pedestrian and cycling advocates, residents, and hospital staff, which was the narrowing of the sidewalk on the west side.  This new one keeps the west side at basically the same width while also providing two additional feet of space on the east side. That's good and important. Additionally, the university has agreed to pay for the additional widening associated with the pathways. This is appropriate.

You know, I'm a little ambivalent with where we are today, and I'm coming in late, but it does seem like this has been a bit more fraught and difficult to get to this point than it needed to be, considering our stated values and policies.

I don't know whether it's practical as a matter of geometry or practical as a matter of cost. I suspect the geometry is fine. I have no idea with respect to the cost. If we could reference a request to the administrator to pursue  barrier protection that if it were consistent with our cost estimates, I would be comfortable with that as an exploration. But to require it here, in my view and understanding, throws out the  earnest effort on the part of the university to reach common ground here, to themselves take on the lion's share of the costs of the city's change of direction.  and to facilitate what I think is an appropriate improvement, and that is to say the expansion from current condition of the transit on the east and to maintain, for all practical purposes, the transit on the west.

We also know from the transportation plan that Fuller Road, which is fully city property, we have problems there, we have crashes. That's one of our high priority  I think, areas to determine how we improve for non-motorized transportation safety. So we're going to have to be determining how, on our side, we're improving that.

Sorry to say I'm not up on my American Poet History, but if you'll allow me, I'd love to read some of what was written in this about him.  Robert Hayden was born in Detroit in 1913. After a traumatic childhood, he attended Detroit City College, then enrolled in the University of Michigan in 1941, where he won a prestigious Hopwood Award for Aspiring Writers. What's that?  Oh, won it twice, wow, thank you. After finishing his degree in 1942, Hayden taught at U of M for several years and was the first black faculty member in Michigan's English department. He taught at Fisk University for over 20 years, but he and Irma, his wife, returned to Ann Arbor to 1201 Gardner Street in 1969, where he taught at U of M until his death in 1980.  During the tumultuous 60s, Hayden was criticized for refusing to call himself a black poet. He called himself an American poet, though he wrote some of the most powerful black history poems in the English language. In 1976, he was offered and accepted the position of poetry consultant to the Library of Congress, later called Poet Laureate, the first black American to hold this position. He accepted and was re-appointed in 1978.  I thought it was also worth pointing out that he moved to Ann Arbor in the 60s, and that was not without challenges for the Haydens, as it was for many black families. As the report states, when searching for a house in Ann Arbor, the Haydens found limited options. Housing discrimination against African-Americans was widespread, even though it was illegal. Another faculty member helped Irma and Robert find the Gardner Avenue house in Lower Burns Park, which they purchased in 1969. And upon their arrival, they were welcomed.

And whereas the Creative Campus Voting Project staffed by University of Michigan faculty and students helped facilitate 9,317 voter registrations in Michigan.

I'm Ken Garber, Ward 2. C1 on your agenda is likely your most important rezoning vote all year.  It will make the village project a by right development for planning commission approval. So if you want to see changes, now's the time between now and second reading. My view is this, Ann Arbor needs the housing and Robertson Brothers is a reputable builder. But this is a plan for 1993, not 2023. This developer is stuck in what economists refer to as status quo bias.  It does not grasp that the climate emergency dictates that we do everything differently, including construction. The village's for sale homes will be all electric, but the apartments, there will be 320 with more planned, will have gas heat. This directly conflicts with strategy two, action one of the 820 plan, which includes the following assumption, quote, all new residential and commercial buildings are designed and built to operate without the use of natural gas, end quote.  And strategy three, action two, quote, all new construction from 2022 to 2030 and beyond is built to net zero energy standards, which includes no natural gas consumption, end quote. Our Office of Sustainability and Innovations reviewed the village last July and wrote this, quote, the use of fossil fuels in any capacity goes against the goals of 820, end quote.  I calculate that the village's 320 apartments will produce 2,064 metric tons a year CO2 equivalent emissions just from burning gas. That almost cancels out the 2,446 metric tons a year that the city's Enerlogix solar at city facilities project will prevent. Gasoline savings from converting commuters to village residents will help, but will only offset about one fifth the damage.  We're told the apartments will be electrification ready, which means that they'll have a 220-volt panel for when it's time to replace the furnace. But gas furnaces have a 15- to 20-year lifetime. We can't wait that long for them to fail. And a heat pump for furnace swap often won't work because ducted systems are inefficient. The affordability versus sustainability narrative is a false one. Look at the apartment project at 1815 North Maple. It achieves both.  A Robertson Brothers consultant wrote that tenant utility bills would be 20% to 30% higher at the village with electric heat. But they used DTE's October 2021 gas rate of $0.67 per therm. That rate is now $0.89, or 33% higher, while electric rates are the same. The operating cost advantage for gas over high efficiency heat pumps is gone, at least for now. Tighter buildings with rooftop solar would ensure affordability.

Public comment making good progress miss dig and permit submitted working to expedite permit with city staff if all goes well We may be able to start work Wednesday or Thursday weather permitting this is regarding the mid-block crosswalk on  Fuller, that was a site of a fatality in 2016. I stood at this podium three or four times and begged the city to address the lack of lighting. The closest streetlight was 132 feet away. When the child was killed, the driver was not found at fault because a driver could not have reasonably seen the child in the crosswalk. I submitted a ticket on January 9th of this year after  The lights had been out for some time. Now we are getting to the point of contacting Mystic. I'm not going to go into all the details, but it is unconscionable for the city of Ann Arbor to not refer street lighting and illumination of crosswalks to the Transportation Commission. For some reason, it belongs to some other department somewhere that seems to be called Kathy Griswold.  We have to address this. So tonight I'm talking about DC one resolution to commence.  a collaborative planning process regarding the bridge. Obviously, we weren't collaborating and planning until certain people arrived on council. But anyway, given the projected cost increase of over $2 million, we need to look at this from a historical perspective and in the context of the greater need for pedestrian and cycling infrastructure in this community, especially crosswalk illumination.  So while we're working on tweaking this bridge one more time, we have hundreds of street lights that are out and hundreds, if not thousands, of crosswalks without optimal lighting, which is positive contrast lighting. So I've already talked about what's happened at Huron High School.  The DTE executive believes that it's two circuits that are connected to at least 35 lights. And these circuits, underground circuits, get damaged from all the development and digging and whatever we're doing. And so they may have to restring lighting.

On January 27, parts of the world celebrated International Holocaust Remembrance Day. Actually, that was just the official day of remembrance. The real Remembrance Day is every day of the year, and if you don't believe that, merely create for yourself a Google alert on the word Holocaust.  The reason for this daily reminding is to fix forever in people's minds the eternal suffering and innocence of the Jewish people. Tonight, I'd like to focus on this alleged Jewish innocence, the innocence that is programmed into our minds by Hollywood, the media, campus, statues, and museums throughout America. We are taught that National Socialists of Germany wished to exterminate the Jews for no other reason than that they were Jews.  We are taught that Jews did nothing to deserve this alleged extermination and were like innocent lambs being led to slaughter. But maybe in 1933, Jews were not as innocent as we were led to believe. The headline of the March 24th edition of London's Daily Express read, Judea declares war on Germany. Jews in all the world unite in action. From the body of the article,  The Jewish wholesaler will quit his house, the banker his stock exchange, the merchant his business, and the beggar his humble hut in order to join the holy war against Hitler's people. And this international call to boycott really was against the German people. Jewish elites knew that the boycott would cause the starvation, the deaths of 30% of Germany's population.  A Jewish newspaper called Nasha Resch wrote, the war against Germany will be waged by all Jewish communities, conferences, congresses, by every individual Jew. Thereby, the war against Germany will ideologically enliven and promote our interests, which require that Germany be wholly destroyed.  Samuel Untermyer, president of the World Jewish Economic Federation, spewed falsehoods in his hate-driven speeches designed to whip up support for this Jewish-led boycott. He said, Germany has been converted from a nation of culture into a veritable hell of cruel and savage beasts. But in fact,  This economic war by Jews against Germany in 1933 occurred long before there was any such thing as sanctions or reprisals of any kind against European Jews. Innocent or warlike, as the Ann Arbor News said today, the past rediscovered.

I wanted to make a couple of comments about a memo from the city administrator that is in our packet this evening. This is relating to the prevailing wage compliance checks that counsel just a little bit of background here. Of course, the city of Ann Arbor  Requires all contractors that we hire for public improvements projects to pay the local prevailing wage Which is essentially the local union wages for skilled craft and craft labor and in 2016 this Not this body, but City Council  passed a resolution asking the city administrator at the time to do cross checks with the contractor's certified payroll. And last year it was determined by staff to discontinue this practice because they had only found one  violation in five years. Now instead of doing that, this body took a different step. We decided to add the practice of periodic random spot checks on site where our city staff are interviewing people about their wages. They're doing wage rate interviews.  This is considered a best practice in the industry. And as this memo notes, in this past construction season, 24 violations were found. So we went from one violation in five years using the payroll records to 24 violations  in one season, which is really significant. I have additional questions. I think this merits some follow-up. I did ask the city administrator today for a couple of pieces of information, the list of contractors who had the violations. I'm particularly concerned about the ones who have unresolved violations at this point. And, you know, it's concerning that there were 17 contractors that didn't know the  correct wage rate. I don't know if that means they didn't know it was a prevailing wage job or what happened there, but we need to make sure they're getting the right information.  And I'd also further like to investigate what other municipalities do when contractors fail to comply, fail to remedy such issues, or repeat offenders. Do we levy fines? Do we consider disbarment from future bidding? Given the scope of the violations that were uncovered this year, I think we need to think about the consequences that we want to levy. And, you know, I just would  Summarized by saying I think that 24 is probably more indicative of what's been happening all along So I'm really pleased that council took that action last year And I think this shows that we need to be doing this indefinitely into the future councilmember Adina", "start": 1587, "end": 1768, "Transition": "\"\"", "Meeting Section": "Other", "Speaker Role": "Other", "is_public_comment": 0, "is_public_hearing": 0, "is_comment_start_trigger": 0, "is_comment_end_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_start_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_end_trigger": 0}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "text": "Thank you, Mayor.

I've owned my historic house at 524 North Division Street for 40 years. I lived there for 12 years with my family and have plans to return there. My house shares a south property line with 530 North Division Street. I'm opposed and protest the PUD. R4C zoning limits multifamily housing  to three units. Both properties, 530, 524, are zoned R4C. However, the only plan Mr. Selby submitted was a non-zone compliant four units, one more unit than R4C allows. When that failed to make it through the planning department, he applied in 2022 for a PUD with the stated purpose of removing the existing 300  3,333 square feet building, replacing it with an 8,000 square foot four-unit building. This timeline shows an attempt to usurp R4C rights of others. It's not allowed under the Unified Development Code. I think Mr. Selby was wasting the planning department's time, council's time, my time, my attorney's time, and will waste court time.  I see the 5.30 proposal as greed camouflaged by green. The property owner to the north is an attorney. He gets three feet of setback. I'm not an attorney, nor is my husband. We get none. Our seasonal storage bin that I've used for 40 years will be taken away. I am now made to share a driveway. I have no place to put the snow.  The perennials lining the driveway are going to be taken away. Our daughter helped plant those when she was six. If Mr. Selby had approached the project correctly the first time, we would not be here tonight. And if an 8,000 square foot building can prove net zero, then a building half the size with the same solar footprint can also be net zero without a zoning change. I request you, Mr. Taylor,  to approach Mr. Selby and request that he produce a building plan that fits R4C and ask Mr. Selby to stop wasting our time. Please stop the PUD.

He gave us endless reasons why the current building is not sustainable, that it's barely holding together, probably just because it's used to holding together.  and how something that is larger in scale could benefit both the neighborhood in terms of attractiveness and also add to more units of housing in the neighborhood.  Preservationists don't take kindly very often to these kinds of proposals, but we had many respectful discussions with Doug Selby, and we came to realize that his plan was a good one, a sound one. We all live in historic houses, and we love our historic houses and all the history of our community that they embody.  These two houses present an unusual case for us because they were two buildings that were just kind of band-aided together at some point in time. They were never a single house. And Doug Selby did extensive research to come to the conclusion that this would be probably the best solution in terms of making this particular building usable into the 21st century.  For that reason we supported the project before the Historic District Commission We also supported the project When it went to the Planning Commission and we support the project here before City Council  We've not always been happy about PUDs. We vigorously opposed what has ended up now as a hotel in the historic district on Glen Street. We were adamantly opposed to that. It wasn't housing. It's a vanity project.

I just wanted to say a couple words about this project, which we're calling The Bridge. From its inception, we wanted this project to be an example. We wanted it to be carbon neutral in operation, which is actually pretty tricky on such a small site.  Buildings also produce a lot of carbon in construction, though, so to a pretty great extent, we're deconstructing the building and reusing as many of the elements as we can. Also, we have a pretty extensive curated list almost entirely of recycled, non-toxic, or sustainably manufactured products. All of them are non-toxic. Can't really go through all the green features here tonight, or we'd be here for a few hours, but what I can say is that this project is a pretty impressive piece of engineering.  and it's legitimately one of the world's most sustainable buildings. We designed it to fit into the streetscape and scale, and design, make a nice piece of architecture. I appreciate the strong support of the Old Fourth Ward Association, and I appreciate the ideas that they came up with to make it better. We also want it to be an educational tour with tours and seminars on site, and videos that explain these advanced technologies, not just how they work, but also how they're installed.  We'll be working with the Skill Bridge Program, which retrains exiting armed forces member in construction, in the construction industry. We hope to work with the Ann Arbor Student Builder Program. These are high school kids who build houses as part of their curriculum. We desperately need this next generation of construction workers to be up to speed on this type of emerging construction technology.  And we want this to be a place for hands-on learning. Passive buildings can offer a better long-term return on investment for developers, and we want that to be out there so that people will be incentivized to do this more. We also wanted it to be repeatable and hopefully scalable so that more people will build deep energy buildings. I know this is just a tiny drop in the bucket, but it doesn't really amount to much unless we can use it as a springboard to make this type of construction much more commonplace.  It's hard to talk about our climate emergency as a scientist without sounding hysterical, but gosh darn it, I just feel like we need to start following our intent with meaningful actions. Buildings are a huge part of the problem, and we need to be incentivizing people to retrofit and rebuild all electric buildings that can become carbon neutral.  I know you can't make everybody happy all the time, but I'm sure you guys know that better than most, as well as the city staff. But I do see that we need to move forward in a way that creatively tackles these problems if we're going to tackle the biggest crisis that humankind has ever seen.

It's a real pleasure for me now to support 530 North Division without reservation. This is a rental that's built to passive house standards, and more importantly, to living building challenge standards. In other words,  It's a building that produces more energy than it consumes. All electric, of course, no gas, with extensive rooftop solar and battery storage, but with a very tight building envelope that breathes using ERV energy recovery ventilation. As Mr. Selby commented, it will employ recycled and ecologically friendly materials and will reuse as much original building material as possible. It employs modular construction.  And according to the site plan, excuse me, one more thing, it will keep and reuse all the stormwater on site. The site plan indicates that this will be one of the most sustainable buildings in the country, but not one of the most expensive. Mr. Selby has said in the past that he doesn't think a net zero building should increase the rental rates beyond market value.  By adding the rear addition, but keeping the same number of units, four, the rents will certainly go up along with the additional floor space, but the larger units will accommodate more people. And there will be much lower utility bills for tenants, given the tight building envelope and rooftop solar.

I just wanted to address another topic tonight, which is affordability. I'm a member of Equitable Ann Arbor, which has as a core value that if you work in Ann Arbor, you should be able to live in Ann Arbor.  These apartments are a market rate. I can't make them affordable and cover the cost of construction. And since starting and titling this project over five years ago, the cost of what it will take to make me be able to break even on this has risen about $600 per bedroom. It's a lot.  It kind of keeps me up at night, but the alternative is to keep throwing good money after bad with a building that is just pretty badly compromised. I think this council understands more than most that in order to keep our city vibrant and dynamic, that means we need a lot more housing, especially if we want to be inclusive with our housing. And if sustainability and affordability are problems the city wants to tackle, we have to address one of the root causes.  One of them is that it's way too difficult and costly to build in Ann Arbor. Outcomes can be very unpredictable. Ultimately, taxpayers pay for that, and it makes our city less affordable and less possible to meet our city's challenges and population growth.  And it also freezes out small local developers. High cost and unpredictability of entitlement can make it too risky. So I know it's really easy to complain about government and bureaucracies and things like that, but there is a lot of stuff the city could do to make this work better.  Just one small example is using the PUD designation to cut through a lot of the red tape and offer people an incentive if they will come up with exemplary projects that the city is looking for. Also, I think it would be a strong incentive for developers, and the city would get better developments faster, and you'd probably foster more trust between the city and the building and development community.  Post-pandemic, a lot of organizations are sort of reassessing their policies to see what's relevant still and what's a relic. And I am heartened to see that the city seems to be having these conversations now. We do have a long way to go, though. And I think we all have to change and adapt to the way we've historically done things if we want to meet this enormous challenge. And certainly, I can tell you the building industry is no exception to that.  So, but I want to leave this one thought is that I would say that a carrot is always a more powerful than the stick if we're bringing about long-lasting positive change.

He spent a lot of time working on amending this ordinance with the attorney for Mishnah who oversees this at the state. It's there's a lot of very specific  language changes that for the most part is trying to make this consistent with state statute. But the reason we brought it forward now is two primary reasons. One was to allow projects that are targeting what's called income averaging. I know the city and myself, we promoted affordable housing for households at 60% of median income or less. There are  different programs including the low income housing tax credit program that has changed a couple years ago that allows a project to qualify for the tax credit program serving households up to 80% of median income as long as they are also serving households at lower income so that they have an average of 60% of median income and the intent is to provide an incentive  to have some of the lower rents set aside for lower income households. So that's one of the most significant changes. In order to do that, we needed to change the pilot ordinance. There's some other changes that are related to just clarifying language about what projects are eligible. And the other most significant change to the language, but it doesn't have really any impact on projects, is that we had two different types of  projects that were eligible. One was based on income and the other one was based on elderly undefined. And we realized in our research that all the projects that are currently eligible for elderly under this ordinance actually are also eligible at 60% of median income. However, the elderly tax exemption in the past, the projects paid 4% of  rents towards taxes and those that were eligible under the 60% of median income only paid $1 per unit per year. So we just made that consistent, removed the elderly component, which wasn't ever really part of the state statute. And so projects would all be eligible under the same $1 per unit per year. And just a note for those of you who are new to this ordinance, which I probably should have said right up front, but  Sorry about that. This allows for a tax exemption for qualified housing for affordable housing. And the qualified project, it's very specific. So it's not just because you're providing housing for households at 60% of AMI or less. You also have other thresholds you have to pass that's in the state statute. And so this allows all these projects to qualify under the $1 per unit per year  tax exemption.

I was a vendor at the street fair last year, and I'm here to speak in support of granting the street fair permit. I think it's important to remember the history of the street fair. The street fair started about 20 years ago to address a very real issue, and that issue was the lack of infrastructure at the Hash Bash. Specifically,  the ability to wash your hands, cleaning up afterwards, subsidizing the police and fire response, as well as just, you know, kind of generally cleaning up at the end, because they clean it up every single year. And that is something that  You know, I think the hash bash needs. The hash bash is going to happen regardless if the street fair happens. The hash bash and the street fair, in most people's minds, there's no distinction. It is one in the same. You take away the street fair, those 10, 15,000 people are still going to show up to the hash bash. Then the question becomes, if they're at the hash bash, they got to use the bathroom, where are they going to go?  And the answer is twofold. One, they go to the local restaurants and they cause a nuisance. And we know because there's a lot of complaints before the street fair about that. Or number two, I mean, they use the city as a sewer. And they go wherever it is convenient for them. And I don't think that's good for anyone involved.  I do want to also address the public safety concern. Because that was brought by the police and it was brought by fire. And I believe it's unfounded. I believe not having the street fair is actually going to cause public safety concerns. Because you have 10,000, 15,000, 20,000 highly intoxicated 20-somethings. And if we don't close off those streets,  I'd rather have them in the streets without cars than in a street with cars because these people are not, you know, sober and they may not make great decisions. And I think it would be a lot better for everyone if we did close off those streets. So what I'm saying is, if you deny the street fare permit,  I believe it's going to cause the very issues that the city and fire are saying are going to happen if you actually grant it. It's going to cause public safety concerns. It's going to cause nuisances to nearby residents. It's going to cause a big mess that the street fair isn't going to be around to clean up this year. And, you know,  It's bad for the community. I mean, it's something where people are going to need these services, and they're going to go to hash bash. So then the question for you is, are you going to allow them to have it, or are you going to deny the permit, and people won't have a place to go to the bathroom, wash their hands? And so for those reasons, I'd suggest you grant the permit.", "start": 483.399, "end": 667.582, "Transition": "\"\"", "Meeting Section": "Public Comment", "Speaker Role": "Commenter", "is_public_comment": 1, "is_public_hearing": 0, "is_comment_start_trigger": 0, "is_comment_end_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_start_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_end_trigger": 0}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_03", "text": "Hello. So the people of the cannabis culture community, whether it's medical or recreational, have spent and lost too much time in their homes hiding, in a car, behind a building. There isn't many events besides the hash bash over the years leading up to legalization.  This is one of the places where it's like a family reunion. We all meet family, friends, we talk about what's going on in the community, what are we gonna do for the next year, and how are we gonna structure the legalization, the recreational, and the medical all together to come together. A lot of the cannabis money that's given to the state of Michigan and to Ann Arbor  is from these stores. These stores are going to be on the Monroe Street Fair. They're the ones there supporting and giving them, the people, the community, education, the knowledge. I come from a place where I had a family member hurt in a car accident, filled him with drugs from the hospital.  If it wasn't for cannabis, this person wouldn't walk. So we need to be able to have a place where we can all meet and rejoice and, shoot, have a place to get together. Ann Arbor has always been the structured place. I've lived here for 40 years. This has been the place. Whether there's a permit or not, like this gentleman said, the people are coming. And there's nowhere for them to use the bathroom. Simple things that have to happen, except for on the Monroe Street Fair.  And boy, I've been there every year. The crew comes out, cleans up everything, and it's in perfect condition. I, over the years, have never seen where the police had more than good interaction with people at both events, which really, truly is the same people walking from one to the other.  the police are very friendly and really don't have anything to do besides watch all of us. So I don't believe the conflict of this football game in April in the mud is gonna be a conflict with this problem that we're having here. It should be a no-brainer that Ann Arbor was the one.

And I would like to explain a little bit about what happened to us about 50 years ago in Ann Arbor and in the Ann Arbor City Council. When my husband, my ex-husband, John Sinclair, got out of jail after two and a half years, he started  back where he left off before he went to jail, and that's promoting music, managing bands, and he organized the 1972 and the 1973 Blues and Jazz Festivals in Ann Arbor, which were a great success and set the standard for festivals all in the country in terms of booking. And comes 1974,  The composition of the city council changed and there were people in the city council who denied us the permit to have the next festival in Detroit.  which was devastating because we had already contracted for the musicians to appear and had invested a lot of money. At the last minute, Windsor, University of Windsor, allowed us to have the festival in Windsor, which was a great disaster.  and led to us having to declare bankruptcy and having to move out of Ann Arbor and move to Detroit. That was in 1972, 51 years ago. So I just want to say that please, city council, don't cancel this culture on us.  That is our culture. We've been fighting for it and now it's legal.

First of all, best wishes for better health for some of your colleagues who aren't able to be here this evening.  I'm here, though, because of the East Medical Center Bridge. I've ridden over the East Medical Center Bridge for decades now to get to my job, to get to meetings on North Campus, to get to the pool when my kids were smaller, to get to robotics practice, and yes, to get to the Songbird Cafe to meet with city council candidates. I ride my bike across that bridge, but nobody else I know does. I don't know if any of you all have ever ridden your bikes across that bridge, but it's  Not good. I don't blame anyone who doesn't do it today because it wasn't built for people like me to ride a bike across it. It was built by your long ago colleagues for people to drive in cars and buses across it.  And so, of course, that's what people do today, because the decision they made 40 years ago that we were going to ride in vehicles across that bridge has haunted us for 40 years. And I say haunted, because I do ride my bike across it. And it's not safe today. It's not safe to cross across the lanes. It's not safe to ride in the lanes of 35 mile per hour traffic. But I've never come and complained to any of you about that, because I know that we can really only afford to rebuild bridges at end of life.  end of life, like Broadway and Stadium once were, where when we rebuilt them, we made sure they met multimodal needs. So I, you know, sucked it up, told my family I'd be careful, not to worry, that I would come home at the end of the day and gone out day after day over that bridge.  And now, the bridge is at end of life, and so you all get to rebuild it. And now is the time. Now is your time to make a change. It's the time to make that choke point welcoming for cyclists, especially those who, unlike me, are too intimidated today to ride across it. Perhaps some of you feel that way.  It's 12 minutes to North Campus. Not one of my U of M colleagues that I know of has ever ridden their bike to North Campus. Besides me, I'm sure there are some. They're just not common, at least in the offices I've worked in. I know that fixing this bridge won't fix the whole route, but you can't fix the whole route today. But this is your only chance to fix this choke point. Because now is the time, and it's the only chance in what's left of my lifetime.  So I'm frustrated to hear that the plan for it is no dedicated cycling infrastructure. Let me repeat that. No cycling infrastructure.  The current plan is for cyclists, like me, to ride in the road. Or to dismount in the center of the road with the traffic around us and haul our bikes up onto that sidewalk. A sidewalk where there is no room for us, even as guests under our policy, because the pedestrian traffic is so heavy.  There's no way that the new e-bikes that I'm sure you all are excited to hear may be coming to Ann Arbor can safely ride in that sort of traffic of the sidewalk today without endangering the pedestrians. I hope that means I have 30 seconds left. Okay, I have old closure. It was really great. Thank you everyone.

This city council wants you to believe they're against violence. Wants you believe they are against gun violence. We have come here all these years with gun violence across the United States, happening almost every day. And we have said, if you are against gun violence inside the United States, you should be against gun violence outside the United States, especially when United States funds it.  United States gives Israel $4 billion a year, and guess where that money goes? To the slaughter of Palestinian people, particularly children.

It's depicting racists in Ann Arbor, which is Ms. Ayer, along with everyone else here, who refuses to take one step  to protect Palestinian people from the violence that the United States, with your tax dollar, is unleashing on them day in and day out. If you think police violence in America is bad, if you think mass murder  on the scale that you see in the United States, which is large and very, very sad, is bad.

You've heard me before, and you may recall from our previous communications, speaking on behalf of Bike Washtenaw, that we'd like to see two things on the bridge. Widening the west sidewalk to about 15 feet to make room for bi-directional bike lanes and a pedestrian lane, which would also serve as part of a campus-to-campus bikeway, and building the planned trail loop under the bridge, which would also be a part of that bikeway. We think it should be straightforward to resolve MDOT's concerns about that.  Now the proposal before you, as I understand it, would call for restoring some or all of the sidewalk space that was taken away in the earlier plan. I have some questions about that, and I'm not sure what the answers are. Is most of the cost of that due to an added beam being needed underneath and abutment support for that? And if so, how many feet of added sidewalk space could we get for an added beam?  If I understand the engineering drawings correctly, both about our current bridge and the planned future bridge, the current beams are about just under six feet apart, five feet, 11 inches, and a little bit more. If that's the case, then we could get approximately six feet of additional sidewalk space by adding a beam. So it'd be good, if this is true, it'd be good to verify that, both council and staff, to find out if that's true, and that may open an opportunity to widen that west sidewalk.  As you know, the city and university have carbon neutrality plans. The university's plan calls for a bikeway between North Campus and Central Campus. This facility could serve as a part of that bikeway.  Ann Arbor's A20 plan calls for a reduction of vehicle miles traveled by 2030 of 50% in Ann Arbor and 25% of trips by walking and biking in Ann Arbor by 2030. Now whether or not you think these goals are achievable, at least it would be good to work towards these goals.  This bridge gives us an opportunity to make progress towards these goals and an opportunity in one of the parts of town with some of the heaviest bicycle and pedestrian traffic. This bridge is a major long-term investment. It's important, we think, to do it right and not to make a $10 million mistake.

She was that and much, much more. She pushed like crazy for Palestinian rights. And as soon as Radina found out about that, you stopped hearing her name pass his lips ever again. You stopped seeing any tweets from him about Councilmember Kozachenko ever again. When an institution or a person supports Palestinian human rights,  You ditch them like a hot potato.

Aloha. My immediate family has taken five degrees from the University of Michigan, so we're familiar with the surroundings. When my wife and I were married here in 1953, do the math,  We went to Hawaii to raise our family. And when we retired from Hawaii in 1993, 30 years ago, we thought about California and Oregon as places to retire.  But we came to Ann Arbor. We found that we had been spending our off time in the summers trading houses with people in Ann Arbor. And they loved to trade houses with somebody who lived in Honolulu. So we settled in Ann Arbor 30 years ago, and we bought a house on the west side. And we have really enjoyed living here.  But in the recent years, we have had some misgivings about that. And I'd just like to raise a couple of issues. Our quality of life seems to have been declining here.  And one of the reasons we found was that there is traffic congestion now. There are more potholes as a result. There are high-rises going up, and there are vintage houses and vintage trees coming down to accommodate them. We find that the city council is really instrumental in this because they're offering gift  well, gift offerings of numerous sorts, but mainly of rezoning properties so that they can be developed upon. And in the long run, we have a feeling that the city council is really instrumental in this.  We have read recently in the New Yorker magazine that the city of Austin in Texas has made its city council into an instrument of profit making for developers and contractors.

So to start off, I found it interesting that at the last meeting, former council member Griswold spoke at public comment, among other things, expressing concern that reworking the plans for East Medical Center Drive Bridge to include adequate pedestrian and bike accommodations might add $2 million to the project cost.  And in some ways, I find this concerning too. But let's take a moment and consider why this is and how we got here. Nearly half of the estimated cost, not counting the contingency fund, is for a rework of the engineering plans that were completed over the last year. This means that had the previous council, including Council Member Griswold, as well as a few of you,  actually chosen to aggressively pursue a design that adequately accommodated all transportation modes, much of this additional cost could have been avoided. Or to put it another way, if we had had the current membership of city council a year ago, it might have saved the city and the university hundreds of thousands of dollars in a year of delay on this project. Better not for hypotheticals.  Main point is we should not fall prey to the sunk cost fallacy here. We will, as previous commenters said, have to live with this bridge for generations. So it's important, and it is worth paying the cost to get it right to the greatest extent we possibly can.  So I do want to offer sincere thanks to some of the folks on council and to Mr. DeHoney for this time standing up for the state of values of the city and getting us this far. Speaking before you in December, I characterized the previous bridge design as a capitulation. Now at least we can say it's a compromise. But it really is just that, a compromise.  We are compromising our city's goals and values by allowing a roadway to be widened to increase traffic volumes, speeds and potential conflicts. When we have adopted plans and objectives to do the opposite, we have objectives to reduce fatalities and serious injuries to zero and to cut our city's total vehicle miles traveled in half. We cannot do this. We cannot achieve any of this if we're going to keep on widening roads.  So in case you can't tell, I'm not exactly happy with the plan that's before you tonight. But I also recognize that this might be it, right? So my ask for you is first, please continue to keep a careful eye on transportation needs in the wider vicinity of this bridge, in the Fuller East Medical Center intersection. It's a critical linchpin in multiple biking and walking routes through the city.  There's a redesign of this intersection potentially coming down the road, so to speak, one which could be even more disastrous for these safety and sustainability goals if we do it wrong.

What you're deliberating tonight has been characterized as a bridge project, but at its core, it is a road widening. Widening a road, whether or not it adds lanes, increases the speed of the road. Faster driving means exponentially more human injuries. And of course, inviting more injuries contradicts your Vision Zero commitment to zero deaths and serious injuries by 2025. The discussion highlights three things that should be worrisome to anyone concerned about road safety.  One, you're debating among choices that will increase car speeds. Two, these choices made their way through staff to your packet in the first place. And three, this is just the latest in a series of examples of how your Vision Zero commitment is somehow not being communicated to or carried out by staff. Recent examples include the Lower Town Mobility Study, a tremendously expensive study that, despite referencing Vision Zero and carbon neutrality, was described by staff as addressing car congestion and was largely car-focused.  Platt Road. The plan to resurface Platt was going to leave it as a dangerous four-lane road. Thankfully, you directed staff to correct this. Huron Parkway. Staff recommended and you approved the resurfacing of Huron Parkway that also keeps it four lanes, maintaining highway speeds through a high school crosswalk where children have been injured. Just like with Platt, please direct staff to correct this. The Fuller and Maiden intersection. Designs were circulated last year that showed adding turn lanes and slip lanes.  How is it that any staff or consultant resources are being used for this? A Vision Zero approach might start by questioning why Polar Road has four dedicated car lanes in the first place, not how to widen it. And now the bridge. So we see a pattern. Why does this keep happening? Why wasn't staff's first instinct to remove lanes on this bridge or add cycling infrastructure? The traffic volume on the bridge is about half of that of South Main Street, where we removed lanes and saw dramatically reduced speeding. Was it U of M's money?  Is any amount of money worth endangering everyone using a road or its sidewalks? What if U of M offered $5 million for a redesign of Fuller and Maiden Lane so they can ram through thousands more cars to their new parking structure? Despite what U of M wants, the Cars First mentality in City Hall needs to end now so we can move forward. My request tonight with the bridge, specifically, is for you to direct staff to create a new design that removes the car lanes and increases the bike and pedestrian infrastructure.  In the broader picture, I ask four things. One, reaffirm your commitment to literally zero deaths and serious injuries by 2025, not fewer deaths and injuries than most of Michigan. Two, direct staff to do road diets by default, so proposals like this never come before you again. Three, remove regressive policies like the so-called neighborhood feedback veto process for sidewalks, traffic calming, and removing parking.  And four, institute other Vision Zero friendly policies like a roundabout first policy and prohibiting the use of car level of service and staff analysis. You're going to spend about a billion dollars over the next two years. Please follow the lead of many cities in the U.S. Thank you. Zero commitment.

Appreciate the opportunity this evening. I wanted to address some of the concern that had been or some of the concerns that has been raised with these events. This is based on our experience. This is something that we feel there's an obligation as the public safety officials for the city to be bringing this forward. What we want to avoid is and after the fact of  you were aware of concerns, those concerns weren't voiced, and then there's criticisms of police or fire for response times and our ability to respond. And that's principally our concern. It's not so much the matter of staff, it's the ability to deploy staff. Last year, we ran into this same  of the three events with the Spring Game, Hash Bash, and Monroe Street Fair. We had concerns going into it, and those concerns were realized. Speaking for fire alone, we had four incidents specific to this event, and our units from the downtown station, their turnaround time was over an hour for each of these events, which is normally a half hour call, tops, being on scene.  So the principal concern is our ability to get staff in and then staff out, and we struggled with just singular medical events, which are to be expected for any crowd of this size. If there should be something that is of more significant magnitude, either a fire incident, EMS incident, where we need to get numerous resources in,  We would absolutely be struggled with that. Excuse me, that would be an absolute struggle, and there would be rightful criticism of our agencies for that. The other concern, too, is this is something that is a very real issue that we deal with on game days, is our ability to get units from Michigan Stadium to the hospital has to go through a downtown network that is less than ideal. And that is a struggle that we deal with with every fall for home games.  We've had repeated conversations with U of M Public Safety, HVA. That's a known factor. We have some contingencies for that. But at least on the football games, we don't then have this block in between the hospital and the stadium. And this event is pretty much right in that area of the strategic pathway.

And I definitely appreciate the camaraderie that we have with a lot of the people that attend these. It's never the mass, it's a few bad actors.  But what I can say is this is the one event that we do have some control over in this city in terms of granting a permit.

So I would first like to thank Ann Arbor Human Rights Commissioner Kida Cohen and also chair of the Washtenaw County ID Task Force for helping to lead us writing this really important change.  And I'd also like to give a little bit of background about why it's so important. The state legislature in 2008, they created a bunch of policies that made it difficult for individuals to obtain both federal and state IDs if they didn't already have one.  And not having one means that you could not also apply for things like housing assistance, to nursing homes, open a bank account. I'm hopeful that the state legislator will be working on this and changing these. But since we've been receiving reports at the Ann Arbor Human Rights Commission that there are some retailers in Ann Arbor who are not recognizing IDs like the Washtenaw County ID.  So essentially this resolution, or I'm sorry, this ordinance would help to ban any of that discrimination from happening to any Ann Arbor resident. So retailers would have to accept any form of a government, a valid government issued ID. And it'll be better for our community as well, because people will be able to access resources they need.

Any further discussion?  For my part, I will just briefly say that I wanted to echo my thanks to the Human Rights Commission and Council Member Ghazi Edwin for working on this, particularly Commissioner Cowan for shepherding this along. I know that we have had considerable work on this over a period of several months, and they have  put in a lot of work to make sure that this can move forward. And I know that also included talking to some retailers, one in particular, Meijer in the community, who folks had expressed some concern about getting Washtenaw ID accepted. And Meijer actually responded. We reached out trying to see if there was something we were missing, if there was something that perhaps we were unaware of that would prohibit them from taking a local government ID. And they actually responded positively that they were going to train their local employees to make sure that they were accepting it.  And so I think a big piece of this is really just continuing to educate the community. And I think this is that next step. So thank you. And I also encourage support. Any further discussion?

So just to catch people up, we've postponed this item a couple of times so that staff had time to gather information in response to questions from council as we discussed an amended resolution that staff brought forward in January.  The resolution was the result of Administrator DeHoney reopening discussions with the university so that we could collaborate on a new design that creates more space for people walking and biking in this area. In our discussion at the last meeting on this topic, I and others talked about the importance of providing a safe, comfortable experience for people that are going to be making use of both the West and the East pathways.  To provide that sense of separation from the vehicle lanes, I put forth an amendment asking for barrier protection and we postponed the vote in part to get information regarding both the costs as well as the kinds of standards that guide the placement of such a barrier.  So staff looked at two types of barriers. One was a low concrete barrier, similar to what you see on Broadway Bridge today. And the other was a more modest and less expensive handrail barrier. Because of the need to be crash-worthy, the only viable option is the concrete barrier. And due to site distance requirements, that barrier could only go on the east side of the bridge, which is the side that is today least trafficked by people walking and biking.  Additionally, we learned that the cost of installing this barrier on one side next to a sidewalk of 10 1\u20442 feet, the width that we want at a minimum, will cost an estimated $1.04 million.  Lastly in terms of the standards that guide barrier placement we learned that from a safety perspective The barrier is not providing additional safety that is over and above the raised sidewalk and the distance for the length from the lane So for that reason I want to move to amend the resolution Before us by striking from the second resolved clause the phrase barrier protected Has been moved is there a second?", "start": 4549.275, "end": 4665.124, "Transition": "\"\"", "Meeting Section": "Other", "Speaker Role": "Other", "is_public_comment": 0, "is_public_hearing": 0, "is_comment_start_trigger": 0, "is_comment_end_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_start_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_end_trigger": 0}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_09", "text": "councilmember ire Any discussion of the amendment?

And to be clear before I finish my remarks, I support infrastructure projects. And I know that projects like this create jobs, especially union jobs.  I want to recognize the tremendous amount of staff time that has gone into this project. I respect Mr. Dehoney and the city's incredible team of professionals. I value U of M and its contributions to our local economy. From jobs creation to investment, the university is an incredible asset to our city. I want to highlight several observations based on the information that I have received and analyzed as a result of the debates and additional information from staff.  The bridge design, in my opinion, is flawed. We know that wider roads are more dangerous for everyone. We know that wider roads result in higher impact speeds when collisions do occur, and as a result, crashes are more severe. This design does not align with Ann Arbor's Vision Zero policy adopted in 2021.  On our own website, the city commits to a Vision Zero goal to eliminate fatalities and serious injuries resulting from traffic crashes by 2025. The Vision Zero plan specifically cites major streets, have more lanes, more travel volume, and higher speeds.  As a result, major streets like East Medical Center Drive are only 25% of the total streets in Ann Arbor, but they witness 89% of severe and fatal traffic crashes. That is significant. While we are maintaining pedestrian infrastructure with this project and are hopeful for the opportunity for an added bike path at some point, we aren't gaining non-motorized infrastructure to keep bicyclists and pedestrians safer with this design.  There is no question that the bridge needs to be rehabbed, but a lot of questions around why it needs to be widened to only meaningfully accommodate more car traffic. I can join my colleagues in appreciating that the university and the city have shown a willingness to both contribute to this process. This is a project that directly benefits the university.  It is my sincere hope that this shift towards working collaboratively with the city is reflective of the university's desire to be a good partner to our government and citizens, and that it will result in long-term better communication and connecting the goals of the universities with those of the city. Working together, we can create opportunities that benefit everyone and advance our collective shared values. I also want to thank all the people who have taken the time to reach out about this project.  Noticeably, the majority of input I received was to urge me to not support this project. This feedback made me reflect on every interaction I had while campaigning, where I promised that I would prioritize infrastructure to make roads safer for everyone and also make our citizens feel more comfortable biking or walking versus hopping in a car out of fear. I think we can all acknowledge that this project is not ideal.  And at the same time, acknowledge that it won't advance our infrastructure to where we aim to be. And if we take Vision Zero into account, that's in just two short years. While I understand compromise is important and necessary in every factor of life, I cannot in good conscience compromise on this issue when I know that it will result in a more dangerous roadway in our city. This decision was incredibly difficult, but I will not be supporting this resolution.", "start": 4684.394, "end": 4909.958, "Transition": "\"\"", "Meeting Section": "Other", "Speaker Role": "Other", "is_public_comment": 0, "is_public_hearing": 0, "is_comment_start_trigger": 0, "is_comment_end_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_start_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_end_trigger": 0}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_09", "text": "Thank you.

So I want to start out also by thanking Administrator DeHoney for working with U of M to reopen this conversation. The plan that we had before added car lane while giving no additional space to cyclists and pedestrians, and that just was not acceptable. The result of these conversations with U of M is agreement from them that we'll gain back the space that was going to be removed on the west side of the bridge, while the east side is still being widened to at least 13 feet, and the university is paying the bulk of the additional cost.  a design that will provide safe pathways for people walking, biking, and using other mobility devices through this important gateway from the north to the center of our city. I want to be clear about where we're at today. Unless we go back and accept the original design for the bridge, this project's going to cost an additional $600,000 alone in redesign costs. That was a cost I was completely ready to bear to do a rehab-only project if we could not get the additional non-motorized space.  Rather than paying $600,000 in redesign costs to get zero additional space for people walking and biking,  we now have the opportunity to get pathways that better support non-motorized mobility than we have today, and with the university bearing most of that additional cost. But as I said, and I think that, you know, we're hearing from other people's comments, from the public comments, this piecemeal process around the design of this bridge has been frustrating to say the least, costing time and dollars that could have been saved had we approached this from the start with our shared carbon neutrality goals and the city's transportation policies.  So I think it's critically important that as we begin projects, we have to start with Vision Zero goals, transportation policy, and the A20 policy. From the start, we need to design for the future we have articulated as our city's vision and that residents have been vocal in saying that they want. This is something I've begun working with staff on and plan to continue working on so that our engineering designs and plans and our public engagement centers around the values and goals of our transportation plan, safety, mobility, and accessibility for all.", "start": 4914.473, "end": 5037.397, "Transition": "\"\"", "Meeting Section": "Other", "Speaker Role": "Other", "is_public_comment": 0, "is_public_hearing": 0, "is_comment_start_trigger": 0, "is_comment_end_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_start_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_end_trigger": 0}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_09", "text": "Thank you.

I think we are in a much better place, both with the design than we were last year, but also with  asserting our goals and values and holding firm to them and coming to a compromise that, while not perfect, is  again, much closer to our stated goals than what we were faced with a year ago.

DC3, a resolution in support of common sense gun safety laws to reduce gun violence and gun deaths in Michigan. Moved by Council Member Dish, seconded by Council Member Watson. If I may, I'm going to start us off on this one.  Our resolution is already out of date tonight because as of the start of this meeting, there have already been 81 mass shootings and 6,025 victims of gun violence in the United States since January 1st. I'm sad, I'm frustrated, and I'm angry that we are again discussing the need for meaningful action to prevent gun violence. I was in middle school in 1999 when the horror at Columbine happened.  It was then the deadliest high school shooting in history. I still remember being gathered in our library that year waiting for the all clear when copycat threats were called into our high school just up the street. I remember hearing then that this would lead to a change in our gun laws, but the following year politicians failed to pass even the most modest gun safety measures.  I was in college in 2007 when Virginia Tech happened, and I still remember thinking how this could have been our campus, our classrooms, how it could have been us. But nothing changed.  I was actually working in the legislature when Aurora and then Sandy Hook happened in 2012. And I still remember sitting at my desk, crying, and later thinking that at least finally something was going to change because we couldn't possibly be the country that allows dozens of elementary school children to be massacred in their classrooms and still fail to have the courage or decency to do something about it. And still, nothing.  I remember gathering in Broncourt in 2016 after Pulse, knowing that the only safe havens for many queer people around the country would never feel quite as safe again, and still nothing.  I remember sitting in my hotel on a business trip in Miami just a quick drive away when Parkland happened. Nearly two decades after Columbine, a new deadliest high school shooting and nothing has changed. In fact, the only major national gun laws that had changed since Columbine expanded access to guns and inexplicably shielded gun manufacturers from accountability.  I remember the texts and phone calls I got after Oxford, where one of my high school friends and her husband now teach. Thankfully, she was okay, but the classroom door we kept seeing on CNN with bullet holes in it was hers. And still, the Republican majority in Lansing did nothing. So here we are again.  All of us still shaken and raw after another preventable act of gun violence, this time just up the road at MSU, where all of us have people we love, especially some of our colleagues here at this table. This is not normal. This is not okay. We are not okay, and we have to do something about it.  We've invested more time and energy into training an entire generation of Americans on how to survive a mass shooting than into actually preventing them from happening. We finally have a legislature and a governor who seems willing to act, but because history keeps repeating itself until the bills are signed into law, I am too afraid to hope that this time things will be different.  But it must be different. And that's all this resolution says. It calls on our state government to act, and the modest protections mentioned in this resolution should be a starting point. Because safe storage laws, universal background checks, extreme risk protection orders, protection for domestic violence survivors, and a restoration of local control over firearms are a starting point, but they are not nearly enough.  Michigan has only enacted 12 of the 50 most effective gun safety laws. So we have work to do because every subsequent act of gun violence is a political decision and a policy failure. And it's unacceptable and unconscionable to fail on this.  The time for meaningful action to prevent gun violence was decades ago, but we will settle for now because now may prevent next time. We owe it to the decades of victims and survivors and their loved ones. So I am begging for this time to be different. I ask for your support. Thank you. Is there further discussion?

So this has been a very tough week for many of us. I don't think it's a secret that I'm a proud Spartan. MSU is not only the first place that I went after leaving home to go to college, but it's also my husband's place of work. And he also instructs a class there. So we've been quite shaken by the shooting that happened there last Monday.  One thing that I've been thinking a lot about this past week is how all gun violence leaves a wake of pain and trauma behind it. The family and the friends of the victims, the community whose sense of safety is shaken. In this case, the thousands of students that spent hours on Monday night locked inside their dorm rooms and classrooms wondering if they were next.  I'm particularly shaken by this event because it's personal, but I'm also really angry that we allow ourselves to live like this, that we have allowed the public health crisis of gun violence to run rampant such that kids don't feel safe in places of learning. We know the reason for the number of shootings in this country.  Numerous studies have shown its access to an astronomical number of guns. More gun ownership corresponds with more gun murders across a number of dimensions, across among developed countries, among American states, among American towns and cities, and when controlling for crime rates. What is more, a recent analysis reveals that gun control legislation tends to reduce gun murders.  So as my colleague said, it's way past time for policymakers and legislators to do something. And I'm honored to support this. I hope that Lansing is listening. And I thank Councilmember Rodina and Councilmember Harrison and everybody that worked on this resolution.

So I believe that when we talk about gun violence, we need to talk about the trauma of systemic poverty and systemic racism in our country. We need to talk about the lack of mental health care, the lack of social service supports, and general lack of a safety net. We need to understand the racial disparities that exist in the criminal legal system and how there's a potential overlap between these disparities.  I also want, you know, and this is not comparable to what many of even my fellow colleagues have experienced in terms of gun violence. But in 2013, I had two gunmen get in my car and put a rifle to my face. And it was very traumatic. It was very painful for me for many years. But I think the most traumatic was I found out that they were later killed by police officers.  And they were young. And I don't know what trauma probably brought them there, but I'm sure it was the trauma of so many things in our society that we don't fix and that create inequity. It probably got them to that place.  And so I wanted to share that story to say that in, you know, thinking about gun reform, we don't want to exacerbate the inhumanity of our mass incarceration system where we imprison more people than any other country in the world.

I just want to thank you for that amendment, but I also want to look to the methods that we've seen here in our community. In the county, there's been an initiative for violence interrupters that is designed to kind of forge more community connections and help prevent gun violence before it gets to the point of incarceration.  So, hearing Mayor Pro Tem Radina speak, I had something prepared with the exact same touch points. I mean, I remember leaving an exam in 2012 and hearing about the shooting at Newtown and at Sandy Hook Elementary School.  I remember thinking that maybe this would finally shame the nation into acting classes of elementary schoolers killed. And it saddens me that another generation has to go through this, has to have this specter of mass shootings hang over their education. And my heart goes out to the students of Michigan State, the families and friends we have, and those around this table who have deep connections to East Lansing.  Um, you know, it's hard not to feel cynical, and I don't begrudge anyone who says, you know, why would now be the time?  there is a new day in Lansing, there's a new State House and State Senate, and we do have a unique chance to see results. And I just wanted to point people to the many opportunities that you have to raise your voice on gun violence in the coming months. One will be a rally tomorrow at 6 p.m. on the Diag. Another will be a rally at the State Capitol March 15th, where we'll be joined by  Gabby Giffords, and then another, a day of action on gun violence, March 22nd. So if there's any time to get up out of your seat, if there's any time to maybe shake away the feelings of cynicism that, I don't know, sometimes it maybe even makes me feel like not wanting to get out of bed in the morning.  I think now is the time to really act and just find those places to gather, find those places to voice your support and contact your representatives.

I tried several times to  write down some thoughts on this. And the words wouldn't come, but maybe they'll come as I'm speaking now. I speak tonight as a parent.

In 2018, there was the Stoneman Douglas. And that, in the intervening years, you know, my children went through high school, like, or elementary school and middle school, and into high school, like every other kid across this country, doing things that  became normal but caused everyday trauma. Having to go to school and do those mass shooter drills. I mean, that's traumatizing in and of itself. When Stoneman Douglas happened and I saw the kids on CNN coming out and speaking so eloquently, that was when I thought, okay, this is gonna change someday and it's gonna be those kids that do it.  And the fact that we now have a democratic state legislature is because of that generation, that generation that has said, I've had enough. They came out, they went to the polls, they voted in record numbers in November. And I am cautiously optimistic that it's going to lead to a change in gun safety laws in Michigan.  We can't keep living like this.

So I just want to kind of touch on a couple of things. What I think it's really important for us all to understand is that  Gun violence disproportionately affects the black community, largely. And as I'm looking for my notes here. It's very difficult. I apologize.  really I should, I guess, share. I think everybody might know this, but so in 2020, and I think 2020 was mentioned in one of the whereas clauses, there were  45,222 deaths that were a result of gun violence. One of those deaths was that of my oldest son. Monday, November 2nd, 2020, the day before the general election in the state where he resided, so he was not able to vote.  again, was a victim of gun violence. So I really tried to put some notes together for this evening, but I think I just really want to illustrate and sharing that with you all. I think you're aware, but some that are watching may not know that about me. I appreciate you supporting the change.  And I would have liked to have a little bit more time, I guess, to provide meaningful input. But that kind of is illustrative of a bigger problem that I want to talk about, and that is that gun violence kills black people more than anyone else in this country.  gun homicides are on the rise in the United States with young black and brown people experiencing the highest rates. And we can see that in our county, the eastern most part of our county. And for the gun violence that has occurred here in Ann Arbor recently, that has largely been retaliatory of the violence that's happening largely on the eastern most part of our county.  We have to be intentional when we have conversations about policy solutions. We want to make sure to bring black people into discussions about policy solutions around this epidemic. It's very important to me that we have people in the room and at the table. I mean, I've experienced, obviously, losing my oldest in a way that I don't want anyone else to experience, and I'm here at the table, but I'm just one person.  So I just want to make sure that we all understand that it's very important that we have voices like mine and individuals that look like me sitting at the table helping to develop policy. You know, when that death, every time we have a death due to gun violence, it represents a policy failure. And so we need to do better.  Could probably say a lot more but that's what I can think of right now.

Um, I am happy to, to, to be able to say that the Annex Group, which is developing the housing, will apply for low-income housing tax credit from the state of Michigan to finance the mortgage on the property, and that our resolution  exempts the developer from property taxes in lieu of an annual service charge equal to $1 for each eligible housing unit as long as the housing project remains affordable housing and as long as they have a state or federally supported mortgage loan outstanding and unpaid on the project. So we by a previous action enabled this to be passed and we will see an addition of 250 affordable  Housing units and that is great and it's an example of something We want to encourage more of which is the private market to get into this work that we are doing also Ourselves through the Housing Commission and our affordable housing millage.

What I would like to point out is also, and I'll get around to this, but in terms of the resolution, I think it's great to try to work with the state, but we also have an opportunity as a city to create our own municipal utility and bypass dealing with a state. And I'd like to point out the state has not been effective in regulating DTE. If you look at the MPSC,  They said themselves in an October 25th press release, 2022, over the past decades, the MPSC has issued a series of directives in response to widespread outages after storms. While there are important efforts underway, the reality is that we still haven't seen improvements in reliability and safety that Michigan customers deserve.  That's our own commission saying that. When we talk about the legislature, a report from the Energy and Policy Institute reports that 138 out of 148 state senators accept money from DTE. Governor Whitmer accepts more money than any other state elected official. We can bypass the state and work at a city level. And we have the opportunity to do that. We have the legal right to do that.  So I think that's something I'd really like to see us do. The feasibility study will show us what options we have.

I'm Dr. Lauren Sargent. I live on Ember Way in Ann Arbor, as I have lived here for the past 40 years. As we've all seen way too clearly the last two weeks, DTE has failed us. Thank you for taking a first step towards demanding accountability for these unacceptable electric outages.  This was completely predictable and largely preventable. DTE can be relied upon to be unreliable, and this is nothing new. Over 40 years ago, then Detroit Edison made a business decision to focus on shareholder value instead of reliability and customer service, and it shows.  One summer in the late 1980s, Detroit lost power. My healthy 93-year-old grandma sergeant became hyperthermic in the heat and humidity of August without air conditioning. She was taken to Sinai Hospital, where she lapsed into a coma and never regained consciousness.  In 2006, we experienced one of our frequent power outages in my neighborhood. My son's buddy's little sister had developed a progressive muscular dystrophy, which left her dependent on breathing equipment at night. I asked the DTE supervisor cruising through our neighborhood, can you get this family some help? Their little girl can't breathe at night without power. The reply? If she can't breathe, she should go to a hospital. That family moved away.  Last week, I found another DTE supervisor driving through a nearby neighborhood and asked, what was causing our four plus day power outage? He said, it is the trees. Tell your neighbors to trim their trees. My neighborhood has underground utilities. Our trees are not guilty.  The callous disregard for the health and safety of the customers cannot be accepted one more day. It is literally a matter of life and death, particularly in winter and summer when babies under six and the elderly cannot regulate their body temperature at a safe level, but any time of year for people who rely on electricity for medical equipment and safe storage of life-sustaining medicine.  I urge you, the council, to join with Washtenaw County and the city of Pontiac to proclaim that this pattern ends here. In 2013, the city of Lansing experienced a catastrophic ice storm with prolonged outages. The citizens called on their municipal utility that is accountable to them, the citizens, to ensure that this would never happen again. Here is the report.  outlining all the changes they made. And no, it is not just the trees. They have not had a major power outage since. These last two storms resulted in fewer than 100 of 100,000 customers out of power briefly. Accountability matters. Either we demand better or we pull the plug on DTE and take the power into our own hands.

It spells out the many ways in which we need to hold VTE accountable for its lack of reliability during the recent ice storm and during the snowstorm that followed. Hundreds of residents in Ann Arbor and in Southeast Michigan  lost power during both storms, some for as many as eight days, a few even longer. We should all be outraged at DTE's lack of preparation for these ever more extreme weather conditions. I propose one small amendment to the resolution, and that is to remove the clause stating that DTE should, quote, attend regularly scheduled Energy Commission meetings to provide updates on what DTE is doing  to improve the resilience of its infrastructure with a focus on energy justice and decarbonization.\" The Energy Commission has the power to call on DTE to speak at its meetings and to get updates at any time. To allow DTE to be always present at Energy Commission meetings gives DTE the opportunity to push forward its PR campaign to greenwash what it's doing and not doing.  So I suggest amending the resolution to remove this one clause. But again, I thank council members Ghazi, Edwin, Sung, and Harrison for putting this resolution forward.

My name is Greg Woodring, and I am the president of Ann Arbor for Public Power. I'm among the unlucky few who had power out for about eight days or for over eight days. I had my power restored on the ninth day of outage, and just five hours later, my power failed once again due to the snowstorm. I'm calling in because I would like to commend Council Member  Ghazi Edwin, Song, and Harrison as well for their resolution calling on greater accountability for DTE within the Michigan Public Service Commission, legislature, and at the city level. I think that it's incredibly important that we all use this tragedy, this mass power outage, to really demand change for something that has been going on for far too long.  DTE has made the strategic decision to invest in our politics rather than their infrastructure. They're the 430th utility. They're one of the most expensive utilities. And as we all just saw, they're one of the most unreliable, with up to nine-day outages followed by even longer outages that have not been fully resolved. Meanwhile, public power utilities like Lansing, Chelsea, Wyandotte all had very short-lived outages or none at all.  The difference is clear between public power and private utilities. And I think that other people across the state are looking to Ann Arbor and seeing that we have taken the steps forward to start to break free and are trying to follow in our example. It's incredibly important that we continue to move along this process to give hope to others in the state that we no longer will have to live under the rule and callous regime of DTE. So I would like to thank  the commission, the council members, apologies for introducing this resolution. However, I would, as other speakers have stated, recommend that it be amended to remove the clause, adding a permanent speaking position to the energy commission meetings for DTE. DTE has already proven that they are willing to lie about their investments in their infrastructure, bragging just a day after the outage, their shareholders about how they  saved $100 million by deferring tree trimming and plan to continue deferring maintenance to keep their budget lean, all the same time while bragging about reliability upgrades to the press. We simply can't allow them to keep spreading this type of misinformation within our city government. We need to remove their lobbying capabilities and we need to break free from them so that we can start to build a resilient and sustainable energy grid that will carry us through the climate crisis.

There has been a widespread disruption to services for under-resourced families with pockets of outages still persisting. In fact, just two days ago, a community resident had reached out on behalf of their 89-year-old neighbor, still without power. By reaching out to our contacts at DT, we were fortunately able to get a team out there to prioritize the repair. Although this response was to the benefit of this elderly resident,  it is symptomatic of a broken system requiring clout for resolution. Loss of food security resources as well as the ability to distribute was seriously compromised and we are the largest distributor in partnership with food gathers in Washtenaw County. Scrambling to meet emerging needs in light of uncertainty of when power would return, this led to emergency actions from dozens of nonprofits as well as municipal staff to enact remediation strategies on an already stretched system.  For example, can establish an emergency food distribution distributing over 7,000 pounds of food and over $5,000 in gift cards. The city in partnership with can and other partners also set up several warming centers, including overnight warming centers, one of which was at the north side for you center, which is one of the universe few resiliency hubs. With expectations that severe weather will only become more volatile. We are far from experiencing challenges to our grid other and other life saving resources.  In addition to tackling climate change, we also need to ensure top levels of accountability from our utility providers, as well as explore options in which to build community resilience.

Mayor, council members, as you just heard, my name is Jeff Wilkerson.  the petitioner and developer for the North Maple Road Apartments project that is on tonight's new business agenda item. I'm also the founder of A2 Collaborative, a local design development firm that, along with local engineering and architectural services, played a role in the early and ongoing project design. I know that this is the first reading for this PUD rezoning,  but I wanted to take the opportunity to introduce and summarize the project and talk about some of our various features. Our team worked diligently to blend elements of sustainability, affordability, community connectivity, and also a reduced reliance on auto-related infrastructure. In fact, our design has an approximately 82% parking to unit ratio.  Not only do these design features, these are important to A2 Collaborative as a firm, but we also believe that they are valued by the community and the city of Ann Harbor. Through our efforts, I believe that we have put together a project that will have a meaningful impact on addressing the lack of housing in the city, as well as producing and allowing for units that will remain  forever affordable at a 60% AMI level. Our project is located on a major trunk line that has access to other parts of the city and the project includes a clubhouse that is dedicated to bike storage and maintenance as well as e-bike charging. The building itself will use far less energy  than a traditionally designed code built apartment complex. And we believe that this plays a role in reducing our carbon footprint and angling towards a less intensive carbon intensive future.  Our building will be all electrified.

Removal of the trees and burn modification is contradictory to the maintenance of the city's urban canopy and city of Ann Arbor forest management plan.

Good evening, Mayor, Councilman and Councilpersons. My name is Ralph Marcus and I represent Earhart Village Association, the 174 unit owners. There are members of the community either requesting to speak tonight or watching or on the call.  We asked to have input in the engineering department's plans for the sidewalk that's contemplated with the Earhart 2023 reconstruction prior to those plans being consulted and submitted, and we were not allowed to have that opportunity. We have asked to be formally advised of a processing track for the plans, for the preliminary plans, and quite frankly, no one from the city has responded, making  this process a little unfriendly, necessitating the use of the association's lawyer at a cost to the association to gain the attention of folks in the city. And we'd rather not proceed in that fashion, but it unfortunately has come to that. We've asked someone to provide a written response to the path of the meetings and schedule for processing and approving the project. And we've asked for those, we've submitted those questions to you all in writing.  Again, we have not had any response. We've made presentations at the Transportation Commission and the Planning Commission, and some of the responses that took place during those meetings were just inaccurate or untrue statements by the folks on those commissions. And I don't blame them, but they just don't have the necessary facts in front of them. We have presented objective rationales to why the planned sidewalk on the eastern side of Earhart Road is just another unconnected sidewalk to nowhere, probably in perpetuity.  The sidewalk can't be placed, as we understand it, in front of Botsford Cemetery. You cannot move the complicated utility equipment on the north end of our property. There's a conservation easement that has a partial sidewalk, which would have to be reconstructed. And that is where the planning commission said, well, the sidewalk's already there. Well, part of it is, but part of it's not. And there's a restriction in that recorded conservation easement, which precludes construction on that property.  Also, there's not any sidewalk apparently being contemplated between the two pine braze streets. So we're kind of at a loss as to why the sidewalk has become so important to the engineering department. If it was to be constructed, the sidewalk would damage critical root tree root and actually remove about seven trees and have to have root protection for a number 30 or 40. And we think that there's probably about 30 trees in total that would have to be removed.  The preliminary road improvement plan that was presented by engineering shows, and I'd like everyone to take note of this, on pages 21, 27, and 40, that the engineering department has this sidewalk, which is supposed to be in the right-of-way, extending into the private property of Earhart Village. I can assure you that Earhart Village has absolutely no intention of providing any authority for the sidewalk to be on its private property, and we do not want the sidewalk constructed.  As we stated earlier, there are these trees that would be damaged.", "start": 1918.903, "end": 2114.101, "Transition": "\"\"", "Meeting Section": "Public Comment", "Speaker Role": "Commenter", "is_public_comment": 1, "is_public_hearing": 0, "is_comment_start_trigger": 0, "is_comment_end_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_start_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_end_trigger": 0}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_28", "text": "Our next speaker is Lisa Reach.", "start": 2114.101, "end": 2125.749, "Transition": "\"\"", "Meeting Section": "Public Comment", "Speaker Role": "Government", "is_public_comment": 0, "is_public_hearing": 0, "is_comment_start_trigger": 0, "is_comment_end_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_start_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_end_trigger": 0}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_30", "text": "Lisa Reach, phone number 841.

Um, yes, my name is Lisa. I'm also a resident at air heart village. And I am opposed to the sidewalk. I don't think the city has listened to us.

Well, you keep referring back to 300 reviews that you had from local residents regarding this project from 2019, I believe it is.  at which point the sidewalk was not even a factor, and you say nobody opposed the sidewalk. Well, nobody opposed it because it wasn't even a factor in that project. So that's a ridiculous argument on behalf of the city. There's plenty of area in the existing roadway to put in two lanes of road, two bike lanes, and if you must have a sidewalk, put it in the existing area.  You said you can't move the curb. Well, I think you can. And in the way that our governor says things, move the damn curb. If you must have a sidewalk, don't impose it on the residents of Earhart village. Speed is also a factor here. And that was requested by the 300 reports that you got back from 2019. And I don't believe that the roundabouts will reduce the speed. So I am requesting that the speed limit be reduced  to 30 miles per hour, like it is on Glacier Way, as opposed to the 35 miles an hour that it is now. And I also hope that in this whole project, you address Green Hill School and our ability to exit and enter our driveway without obstruction during drop-off and pickup time.

I'm here to talk about a golf issue that we're having. My issue pales in comparison to no energy, but it's important to me and it's important to 50 other senior golfers that play at Leslie Park. In 2009, you adopted a resolution that set rates and restrictions for season passes and green fees.  Since that time, the green fees have been amended five times, each time by council approval. Season passes have never been brought forward for amendment. They remain as you adopted them in 2009. This year, amendments were made by staff that changed the original intention of the adopted resolution. For example,  Senior season passes specifically allowed we can play for senior golf the commentary section specifically says Now available for use on weekends This year Park staff changed that policy so that seniors can no longer play on the weekends We are not allowed to play at Leslie Park or  on Saturday and Sunday, unless we pay the daily fee, or by a full season pass, which costs $400 more, or a 67% increase. Seniors are the only ones impacted with these cost increases. That is not right. The change, I believe, is not in line with the original intention that council adopted in this resolution.  The second change that was made was to limit the use of a full pass. A full pass allowed users to play seven days a week anytime. Now Parks is saying you cannot play on weekends until after 12. You would think that's no big deal. But the resolution specifically states it's a full pass. It does not allow for restrictions. For me, the cost I estimate to play on the weekends, because I play in the mornings, will be $1,500.  I will gladly pay that, but I'm going to pay that somewhere else if I have to, because I feel that passionate about the change that has been made that it is not right. And again, the change to the full pass does not meet the original intention of the resolution that you adopted. Another change is the original resolution included monthly, senior, full, and weekday passes. Those have not been offered in the four years that I've been in Ann Arbor. I don't know where they went.  The resolution you adopted allows it, but they've disappeared. I think they need to be reinstated and offered to the golfers as allowed by the resolution. I believe that the resolution binds the park staff to offer what was presented and approved. Staff should not be allowed to change the original intent of any resolution that you adopt.  The changes currently made by parks were never presented to the public, and we hope that you do something about trying to get these back in order.

I reside at 782 Greenhills Drive and represent Earhart Village Homes Association as its president.  I want the council to be advised that Earhart Village in no manner, shape or form proposes or provides that the city of Ann Arbor with any permission to trespass onto our private property for the construction of a contemplated and unwanted sidewalk. A properly circulated and documented petition of over 100 residents of Earhart Village has been formally submitted along with the board resolution  and narrating cover letter objecting to the subject sidewalk. We asked the clerk to accept the petition and the accompanying documents. Bearheart Road needs to be repaved. It just doesn't need to have a sidewalk to nowhere built, which would be a dramatic waste of city resources and will ultimately lead to significant damage to the property of Bearheart Village. Should our reasonable requests not be accommodated, as they have not been so far,  We certainly are positioned with legal counsel to protect the interests of our residents. Notwithstanding, we would rather collaborate with the city for an amicable solution and invite all parties to a meeting to reconsider the existing plan. I'm most concerned about the fact that we have attended all the community meetings regarding this project, beginning in April, 2019 through December, 2022, to express our opposition to the construction of this sidewalk.  We have written to the mayor, to the city attorney, the city administrator, the public service manager, planning manager, council person, and others, and no one, not one person has responded to us. We have commented during the most recent planning and transportation committee meetings, and we have been left dismayed by the inaccurate responses of some of the commissioners and engineering personnel. We pay our taxes. Where is our representation?  We believe the sidewalk is unnecessary because the sidewalk already exists on the other side of the street. And there is no requirement in Ann Arbor for sidewalks on both sides of the street. You've already heard about the many gaps that would exist between the Pine Gray streets in front of Botsford Cemetery and on our conservation easement. And we do not believe that the 1972 sanitary sewer easement previously granted  gives the city the authority to construct on our private property. Our ISA certified arborist noted in his recent inspection that not only will an unsightly retaining wall be required due to the grade, but removing large tree roots can make our remaining trees unstable and a hazard to the homes behind them. The construction activity will stress the remaining trees, making them susceptible to insects and diseases, causing death and decline. And on top of that,  The tree canopy in our neighborhood has already been severely impacted by the development of the Concord Pines subdivision where over 1,000 trees were recently destroyed.

I witnessed firsthand a wire that dropped to the ground behind our house on Friday, March 3, that sparked throughout the night until noon on Saturday. Firefighters assessed the situation early on, determined that it was not critical, and called DTE. It wasn't to be a repair. A DTE safety staffer sat in a car idling  at the head of a dead-end street watching it to the wire to be sure that people did not approach the unsafe wire. At noon on Saturday the power was cut and the repair of power was completed 24 hours later on Sunday. We heard about people's loss of work expenses for spoiled food and obtaining food that did not need to be cooked during the outage as well as costs for hotel rooms when available many of which were priced excessively. Please add the cost of Ann Arbor firefighter time that was not available for other fire emergencies in the city  due to the need to check on the many downed hot wires, the cost of warming centers, and other emergency services in the city. Those costs add up and they should be charged directly to DTE. We appreciate the service of all the technicians and electricians who helped return our power. We're not pleased with how DTE management appears to depend on ignoring maintenance to gain the financial return for its investors and simultaneously ask for higher rates.  In Bridge Magazine, it's reported on February 10th that DTE asked the MPSC for permission to increase its yearly revenues by $62 million, representing a 14% residential rate increase. At the same time, DTE reported a $1.1 billion gain to its investors. What the heck? Search for MPSC on the eDocket. Once on that page, search for case number U21297.  click on submit comment and tell the MPSC to deny the rate increase requested by DTE and set a procedure to make DTE accountable to its customers ahead of its investors. I agree with the resolution that you're considering tonight and agree with the prior speakers that you remove the resolve clause relating to DTE as a regular participant in the Energy Commission. DTE should not influence our Energy Commission recommendations  They're extremely good at crafting influential messages that distort actual services received.", "start": 3220.124, "end": 3424.829, "Transition": "\"\"", "Meeting Section": "Public Comment", "Speaker Role": "Commenter", "is_public_comment": 1, "is_public_hearing": 0, "is_comment_start_trigger": 0, "is_comment_end_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_start_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_end_trigger": 0}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_28", "text": "Our first 15 speakers having spoken to us and provided their public comment within a time less than the 45-minute period, we now go on with public comment overflow.

I live at State Street Village Apartments. And part of the reason why I'm here today is because I've lived in a lot of areas, but this is the first time where I'm paying as much in rent as I have been. I'm paying as much in utilities as I have ever. And the first time I've ever been without power for more than six days. And that's why today I want to talk about a critical issue that affects us all, power outages. Power outages are a major inconvenience, and they can have devastating consequences for businesses, hospitals, and homes.  They disrupt our lives, compromise our safety, and harm our economy. But what causes these power outages? One of the main reasons is the failure of privately owned electric utilities to invest in infrastructure and modernize their power grids. Private utilities often prioritize their profits over the needs of their customers, which can lead to the neglect of the system, resulting in blackouts and brownouts.  It's time to recognize that electricity is a basic human need and should be treated as a public good, not a commodity for private profit. We need a public ownership model for our electric utilities, one that puts the needs of the peoples first.  Public ownership of electric utilities means that the community, through its elected representatives, owns and controls the electrical grid. This model ensures that the utility is run in the interest of the public and not for private gain. It also means that the public can hold those in charge accountable for their actions, something that has been severely lacking.  In addition, public ownership of electrical utilities would lead to greater investment in infrastructure, making the power grid more reliable and less vulnerable to outages. It would also create jobs and economic opportunities in our communities, as local workers would be employed to maintain and upgrade the system.  Some argue that public ownership of utilities would be inefficient, but the evidence suggests otherwise. Municipal utilities, which are owned by local governments, consistently outperform private utilities in terms of reliability, affordability, and customer satisfaction.  In conclusion, power outages are a serious problem, and we need to take action to address them. Public ownership over electrical utilities is the solution. It will ensure that the needs of the people are put first, and that our power grid is reliable, modern, and sustainable. Let's work together to make this a reality.

A couple of roads projects happening in the fourth ward. One is the Sio Church Improvement Project.

You can learn more about the project and sign up for updates by visiting the project page on the city's website.  On March 16th at 6 p.m. There's going to be a public forum at the Pittsfield branch library to share details about a planned utility and road resurfacing project on Greenview that's a project that's planned for next year, but they're starting the planning right now and Residents will have the opportunity to provide input on safety improvements and I guess continuing with my mobility focused updates I wanted to give an update regarding progress on the issue of cars parking and bike lanes, which I think  I think a lot of us hear a lot of complaints about, I see this every time I go down Main Street. So one thing that people probably already know about is that the community standards has stepped up enforcement a lot. They're gonna continue to do that, whether it's complaint based through the number or whether they discover it while they're on patrol. They're also planning to send a letter to all the delivery companies, so like UPS, Amazon, FedEx, informing them of our bike lane ordinance and letting them know that we're actively enforcing it.  Also, we are going to implement a process by which citizens can make a report to community standards with a photo with a license plate and a date, time, and location of the incident. And the city will send a warning letter to the registered owner of the vehicle that says that future infractions may result in a ticket.  They're going to be working with transportation signs and signals to get additional signage installed where there isn't any, especially protected bike lanes. And then last but not least, what I'm very excited to see on our agenda tonight is tiny street sweepers, snow plows. The purchase is going to allow us to maintain the single track bike lanes. And that has been an impediment to the installation of bollards.

Moreover, it assumes, quote, all new residential and commercial buildings are designed and built to operate without the use of natural gas.  As to housing, Ann Arbor urgently needs more housing, especially affordable and workforce housing. City Council has approved two housing-related goals that I know of. First, in 2015, setting the goal of catalyzing 2,800 new affordable housing units by 2035. And second, in 2020, by approving the 820 plan, which in Strategy 2, Action 1,  targets catalyzing 2,000 new units of residential, multifamily, or ADUs, presumably including some of the affordable housing units from the first goal. City Council has never declared a housing emergency. So where do we stand on our housing and climate goals? Since the A20 plan was approved, 2,600, approximately 2,600 new housing units have been approved or are in the approval pipeline.  In addition, the University of Michigan has announced it is building a 2300 bed dormitory with a second phase plan. A lot of new housing is being created. That's great. Unfortunately, at least 30 of the 46 new housing developments announced since the approval of the A20 plan will be natural gas connected.  The Village of Ann Arbor's 440 planned garden apartments in two phases are among them. They all represent assets which will emit atmospheric sewage for at least 20 years. These emissions will undermine the A20 plan well beyond its 2030 target.  You know that all electric developments are financially and technically feasible. You've approved several of them. The village's development or the village development could be all electric, energy efficient,  and have low utility costs. DTE has publicly stated it can provide the required electric grid infrastructure. My former employer, Bosch, in response to an inquiry that I made a week ago, stated in writing that it has thousands of air source heat pumps in stock.  And finally, we know from an analysis of over 260 developments in Pennsylvania presented to the Energy Commission and provided to the Planning Commission that super energy efficient passive house certified  May I continue? Of course. Okay, thank you. That super energy efficient passive house certified multifamily projects with low utility costs are being built at or below the cost of code compliant ones. There is no reason to approve the village project tonight.  Moreover, it makes no sense to provide $31 million in brownfield incentives when the project does not include any affordable housing units and it will be heated with natural gas. Do not approve this project in its current form. No one would approve new developments which discharge liquid sewage. Why approve this one?  A short delay on this project is worth the short-term impact on new housing availability. Thank you very much. And I'd just like to say, most of you know me from the work I do in the energy and climate space, as well as environmental space.

I'm going to speak to all three of these public hearings tonight because it is that important as the previous speaker pointed out. But this first one is all about zoning. And this zoning, this R4C that this is being requested for is as bad as the R  are one that it came in as when it was annexed in from the township. And I think it needs to be made clear to everybody, the public and the council, that this developer has no right to this zoning request. It's a request and we definitely have the right to say no to something like this, especially if it's not what we're looking for. And as the previous speaker made quite clear, it certainly isn't what we're looking for.  The concerns that I've heard in the community that, well, if we don't give them this, they'll do a buy right R1C, I think that that's an unsubstantiated consideration. This council has made so many efforts, substantial efforts, to do away with R1 zoning that I would hope that you would defend against R1 zoning going on this site. This needs something better. This needs a new zoning designation that we should have put in place when we redid our master plan, which is now called the comprehensive land use plan, thankfully. And we should have redone that plan  2018-2019 for various reasons that got delayed and we didn't. Saying no to this zoning request is an opportunity to reconsider and correct the past's vision, our vision of the past that's reflected in a tired and inappropriate zoning designations. What is left in our master plan, our comprehensive land use plan, is just been rehashed and rehashed over and over.  And it's not what we need. It's not what we needed 20 years ago even, but we're going to let that go. So I think it's very important that we say no when a bad project comes before us and give ourselves the opportunity to correct errors we may have made in the past or just write the ship of state as new information comes to light. I'd like to see a better zoning designation for R4E and E for environmental.  Now, there's so many things that are wrong with this. If you read the staff report on just the zoning, how it's going to destroy the already terrible intersections around it, how it's going to add to traffic, how it's going to be a big carbon waste because we don't have the proper zoning in place.  The thing that's shocking to me about this is this represents more than a quarter of the area of our downtown, and it is twice the size of the original University of Michigan campus. And to think that that would go unplanned or planned by a developer who's just going to shoehorn something in that doesn't even belong in a cornfield, Northfield, no offense, into our fine community, really essentially 80 acres here because they own the other adjacent parcels, it's a tragedy. And this is an opportunity to set that straight and rethink this project.  I think you should really give it some thought. It's important to the community.", "start": 4614.525, "end": 4799.708, "Transition": "\"\"", "Meeting Section": "Public Hearing", "Speaker Role": "Commenter", "is_public_comment": 0, "is_public_hearing": 1, "is_comment_start_trigger": 0, "is_comment_end_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_start_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_end_trigger": 0}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_27", "text": "Thank you.", "start": 4799.708, "end": 4810.495, "Transition": "\"\"", "Meeting Section": "Public Hearing", "Speaker Role": "Government", "is_public_comment": 0, "is_public_hearing": 0, "is_comment_start_trigger": 0, "is_comment_end_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_start_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_end_trigger": 0}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_17", "text": "Thank you, Mayor Taylor. Ken Garber, 28 Hammer Hill Court. I respectfully disagree with Mr. Hayner. I think the R4A zoning, which I think is what's on the table, is entirely appropriate for this site.  We want higher density, multifamily housing where possible, but not at the expense of our 820 plan. As Mr. Murski said, the plan explicitly calls for no natural gas connections and new construction. And it assumes all electric, excuse me, all electric net zero energy buildings starting in 2022.  The village's 320 apartments will generate, by my estimate, 2,064 metric tons a year of CO2-equivalent emissions just from burning gas. Gasoline savings from converting commuters to village residents will offset only about one-fifth of the damage. One benefit of high-density development is fewer emissions, but gas furnaces completely defeat the purpose.  As architect Jan Culbertson said at the recent CCL-OSI forum on housing, transportation, and climate, quote, we cannot invest in legacy carbon emissions, end quote. Please think about what we're doing. The climate does not care about solar panel contracts, climate millages, or carbon neutrality target dates. The climate only cares about one thing, the raw physics, the molecules of CO2 and other greenhouse gases we're putting in the atmosphere.  That's it. And in that respect, we as a city are failing. Last month, I think you got the report that I put together on new developments and the 30 gas burning projects that Mr. Murski referred to, when complete, will generate about 24,000 metric ton CO2 equivalent emissions from gas combustion alone.  This is more than quadruple the estimated 5,700 metric tons of annual emissions that will be prevented through the combination of solarized installations, the pending solar at city facilities contract, and the Homeland Solar Parks contract. Reduced commuter traffic will only offset about 1 7th of these emissions. So we're not just violating 820, we're wiping out these renewable energy gains and putting the city's emission reduction targets out of reach.  It doesn't have to be this way.  You heard a little earlier from Jeff Wilkerson on the North Maple PUD project. He has on the agenda for later tonight, 79 apartments, all electric, 90 kilowatts rooftop solar, geothermal, battery storage, wall and roof insulation superior to the village, affordable housing with 15% of units at 60% AMI.

Tim Lockren, Robertson Brothers Holmes, good to see you. I think some of you didn't see me speak in front of you before.  6905 Telegraph Road. I'm representing the development team. It's been a long road to tonight. There's been a lot of discourse with neighbors, with staff, with public bodies over the course of the last three years. We're not the first to look at the property. In fact, we even have dropped it once ourselves. It's a very difficult property. There's a reason why there's 67 acres of land in the heart of Ann Arbor.  It's a landfill and there's a lot of cubic, there's about 1.9 million cubic yards of rubble and fill. So we have a lot that we're dealing with on the site. Again, that's why it's out there for so long.  I just want to give a few highlights. I'm not going to give obviously a whole presentation, but we really did see this as a village concept. We wanted to look at multiple price points, and I think we've done that. We've got home sizes from 684 square feet to 1,850 square feet, both rental and for sale. It does meet the surrounding zoning districts. It also meets the existing, the specific density and the future land use plan of Ann Arbor.  We're not asking for a PUD, we're asking for a straight zoning of R4A, and again, that meets the surrounding districts. We'll have multiple open space areas. We'll provide public connections between Olson Park and Leslie Park. Right now, there's really only one private entrance into Leslie Park. This would open that up for the public. We'll have about 65% open space and significant wetland preservation.  It's a walkable project over a mile of pedestrian bike paths, or sidewalks and bike paths. These are all open to the public. It's an appropriate mix of residential land use. It's within a targeted growth location. If you look on your master plan, it specifically calls for growth in this area. And we will have family-oriented plans. So again, we'll have that kind of mix of housing. It's a reclamation of a former landfill property. It's a very difficult property to work with.  Lots of green energy and initiatives a portion of it will be all electric. That's the for sale portion of it Significant portion of the property and we'll include energy efficient appliances. We'll have solar panels on the clubhouse We'll also have solar street lights throughout We'll have a contribution of about 1.2 million to the DuVarn and Pontiac Trail Road improvements over 300,000 and park improvements as well  High quality owner occupied homes and menatized apartment homes We are venturing with a very capable and reputable partner in DTN management And you know shameless self-promotion, but you know, we've been around a long time You know, I think we have a very good reputation. That's something that's very important to us And I think it's important to the city to know you have somebody that'll stand by the project So we're here to answer any questions Throughout. Thank you.

So at least one of the previous speakers  Mentioned that the city hosted a housing and climate change forum a couple of weeks ago. And I think the biggest thing I took away from that session is dense multifamily housing in cities is 1 of the best tools that we have to combat climate change. Because multifamily buildings are more efficient and because enabling folks to live near their jobs and have a variety of transportation options. Is is much better than the alternative.  But I also heard something else in that forum, which is that we need to be really careful about placing severe restrictions on developments in the city, unless we can do so in cooperation with the rest of our region. If Ann Arbor decides to require 100% electrified developments, and our neighbors in Sio Township and Pittsfield Township and so on don't do any such thing, then what is the net result of that going to be? It could backfire on us. So  we need to consider what the alternative scenario really is when we're making a choice like this. And so I heard Mr. Murski saying that we can do both. We can have successful 100% electrified developments without rendering them infeasible. And I want to believe that. It would be great if that's true. But I'm not sure I do believe that's true in every case on every single site.  And I certainly remember some previous instances with somewhat different context. We weren't talking about energy. But we have seen cases in the past where prior councils demanded too much of developers. The developers walked away and we got much worse by right projects instead. Or we might get nothing here and we'd only ramp up demand.  for sprawl out in the township, as I was saying before.

To me, it appears to be illegal under R4A zoning.  That's because the front setback along Duverin Road exceeds the 40-foot maximum front setback requirement. The developer needed the space to meet the 65% open space requirement under R4A. Planning Commission approval was conditional on the petitioner obtaining a variance from the setback requirement. To my knowledge, that variance has not been granted. So this plan, as it stands, looks illegal to me.  Now, the developer recently annexed some properties that will allow it to meet the open space requirement and fix the setback problem. But we have not seen that plan. The plan before us tonight has too big a front setback on DuVerin as I read it. But you should ask your staff. I'm not an expert on zoning. Before voting, I suggest that you settle this question.  Small point, your meeting agenda is incorrect when it says the Planning Commission voted 9-0 to recommend approval. The actual vote was 8-1, with Commissioner Ellie Abrams voting no. Many other commissioners were highly critical of this project. A few moments ago, Mr. Loughran described the positive features of this project.

I want to start by acknowledging that, you know, as I said many times, I think I said a couple years ago when we were seated as a new body that I think we have to acknowledge that this land doesn't belong to us in the first place. And so the idea that it's going to be insured for profit is really offensive to me. I spent the last 26 years within a mile of that site, living within a mile of that site. And the last three years within a stone, literal stone's throw of it, I'm working on some community garden projects up there.  And so it's a special parcel and it's a shame that 76% of the existing trees on it and 60% of the landmark trees on it are going to be, it's just, it's a clear cut like everything else we do around here. There's nothing special about this project. Before I get into the specific site plan things, I think we need to face up to the fact that no matter what we do, the townships are going to develop and they're going to develop in the way that they want to do.  And yeah, we haven't reached out, and we haven't done a proper partnership with the townships, and we haven't done proper planning in a regional way. But that's neither here nor there. We don't build it here. They're still building in the townships, because I get dozens and dozens of contracts lined up all through next year to repaint the builders' paint in these beautiful houses they're building out there, and also apartments and townhouses. We need housing. We need housing everywhere. I don't think that's a surprise.  The whole planet does. But not all housing is alike, and the city of Ann Arbor has prioritized its housing. This site doesn't have, this site has, it's typical, it's actually, I had some friends from other communities who follow council as closely as I do, and they wanted me to come up here and say this is an insult to this city and the residents, this project, no offense to the developers. This site has no net zero housing. This site has no low income housing.  It has no affordable housing. The site has no senior housing. It has no ADA accessible housing. It has no cooperative housing, no live-work housing, no group housing. We deserve better. This site plan is... I think the most offensive thing to some of my former constituents and my friends and neighbors at Arrowwood is the way that this is packed and clustered next to Arrowwood, that the large apartment units are massed  right up against the Arrowwood facility. But there's no notion of connecting those communities or creating cooperative communities. It's just a way to stuff the houses on this property. And the folks who say that perfect shouldn't get in the way of the good should recall that in many instances, we have said no to the not perfect and gotten better. And the finest example that I can recall, at least in my time on council,  the Lockwood development where we said no to a Lockwood on an inappropriate site on the west side, and we got a much larger and better project on the south side.

Ken Garber again. Brownfield. My apologies. Thank you. Discussion. No, you're absolutely right. I did touch on the Brownfield, but I thought it was relevant to the site plan. I will speak to the Brownfield specifically. As you know, state law allows local governments to reimburse private developers for cleaning up contaminated sites using tax increment financing.  This is completely at the city's discretion. The village parcel has an old landfill that's emitting some methane. Under this brownfield plan, the landfill stays, but the developer puts in some specialized building foundations, passive venting systems, and a methane interceptor trench. It's asking for $31 million over 13 to 18 years. The $26 million to protect the residents from contaminants is necessary.  agree with that. But they're also asking for $5 million for non-environmental, non-remediation activities. Now, here's the thing. The city's brownfield policy requires that if such non-environmental activities are in the plan, the developer must provide affordable housing, 15% of units at 60% AMI. But there is no affordable housing here. Instead, the developer is substituting sustainability elements and a new roundabout for that affordable housing.  So your task tonight is to decide whether that tradeoff is worth it. Um, to me, it's not totally unacceptable, first of all, because this project is very unsustainable. It's not addressing climate change. It's contributing it to it. Yes, we've heard about the solar on this that powers the streetlights that's on the clubhouse and the heat pumps in the for sale units. But as I told you in the previous hearing, it turns out that  We're being asked to pay the incremental costs of all those elements and the roundabout. So the way I see it, they want us to pay for those environmental and traffic improvements, and yet they're saying we want to substitute those improvements for the affordable housing standard in the city brownfield policy.  They pay nothing, we reimburse everything, and they get to bypass the affordable housing requirement, as I see it. I mean, I wish I were wrong, and maybe I am, and I'm sure the developer will address this. Their view, I suspect, is that because the city did not require any of this stuff, the city should pay for it, not them. So you have to decide whether  You buy that. Here's what I think we should do. Offer the developer three options. Option one, add the affordable housing that city policy requires. Option two, remove the $5 million request for non-environmental activities. Or option three, do full electrification. Remember, the city has total discretion. We can set any condition we want.

So I encourage you to read the Brownfield report and the conditions that have not yet been met for this to be approved, because there's several.  should not say yes to this until those conditions are in writing. As another caller and as the report points out, it's not really a cleanup. It's basically some advanced radon systems are going in these houses, some special foundations and some trenches and things like that. $31 million. So the polluter, multiple polluters, including the University of Michigan, who use this for landfill for decades, skate, and we pay for the supposed cleanup,  by foregoing tax revenue. And that's not right. The state gives us the authority to do this, but it doesn't require us to do this. It doesn't require us to subsidize any of this. And from an investment perspective of the city, it's a terrible idea to take, I know this is how it's supposed to function, but it's a terrible idea to give the developer a dodge for the first period of that tax payment when we should have that money in our bank earning interest  for the eventual support of this infrastructure that they're putting in. But that's the way that's going to go down. So it doesn't have MEDC support it needs. It doesn't have the tips capture agreement and start date in place. And it doesn't have the duration of that written in the agreement. Those are non-starters. This should not be approved. Now, I think that  We need to set aside, the council needs to set aside personal interest for the public interest on this matter. It's a big chunk of change we're giving out. I know that a lot of development happens in this community simply because council wanted property tax to play with. And that's fine, at some point this will be developed and it will be developed properly in a way that supports the sustainable commitment that we have made to this planet, supposedly. This isn't it.  And this so-called cleanup could come back and bite us in the future when everybody's sucking methane out of their basements, just like they're sucking dioxin. We should not be paying for polluter cleanups. Ann Arbor is a gem in this city, in this state. I think everybody knows that, and in this country. And we let it just turn to garbage.

As you are already aware, we will be speaking to this project three times tonight on our agenda. This first time we vote on the rezoning, so I will not go far into the project's details. This project, as you have heard, reclaims a former landfill site that has gone neglected and undeveloped for decades. It will create 484 units of housing,  with a second phase to come. This will be a mix of owner-occupied townhomes and apartment rentals at multiple price points. The developer has agreed to make the 164 single-family townhouse-style homes fully electric after a productive series of discussions with the Office of Sustainability and Innovation planning staff and the planning commission. In other words, the project didn't come in that way. The developer agreed to provide that amenity.  The garden-style apartments will rely on gas heating.  We've heard from many of you that since council is rezoning this project, we should make full electrification a condition of that rezoning. Rezoning, unless we are rezoning to a PUD, is not an opportunity for council to extract unlimited public goods. Our zoning decisions as a city must be consistent. We have been zoning projects near this location without requiring full electrification. We have no basis in law to do so.  That is the only question. It is not whether full electrification is feasible or whether the supply chain for heat pumps exists. It is whether we have a basis in law or not to require full electrification. This is something that I want.  But imposing it project by project on some projects but not others is neither a fair nor an effective way to get it. It must be established in code and law as a universal requirement and expectation for every developer who wants to build in Ann Arbor in the near future. The questions before us is whether the proposed R4A zoning is consistent with adjacent zoning surrounding land uses and with the land use element of the city's comprehensive plans.  The answers to these questions are yes. This does not mean that we hold our nose and vote for this project. Even without full electrification, there are other sustainability benefits to this project, foremost among them being that it reclaims a former landfill site that has gone undeveloped for decades and remediates it to the point where it is safe to house people there.  The housing that it will provide may turn some commuters into residents. It will certainly provide rental housing at lower than downtown prices, which is something the city sorely needs and is working very hard to encourage with TC1 zoning elsewhere in the city. It will also bring infrastructure improvements to Pontiac Trail. It will not degrade Pontiac Trail. It is one of the only mechanisms we have to bring needed infrastructure improvements.

And when I do that, this rezoning, that's the only way I'm going to look at this rezoning. Is that appropriate or not? I think there are members of the community who are asking  for community benefits that would only be obtainable through a PUD, and if the only things that potentially is community benefits, and that would require for us to think about rezoning only to PUD within the city of Ann Arbor, which does at this point in time, which seems a little bit of an unreasonable request, and fundamentally illegal.

There's just a lot of planning on the agenda tonight. So you're going to hear from me a lot. It is rare to see projects that hit all of the city's major priority initiatives. And this one does. Sustainability, affordability, and greater density where there is infrastructure to support it. This project is also a PUD.  And it is the units that it will provide are considerably smaller than those that will be provided by the other project that we have on the agenda. We are asked to rezone from township to PUD, which means that we need to be attentive to the public benefits  and to comparisons to the nearest existing zoning district. So this will be an all-electric development, and that's a major public benefit. This may be achieved, they are exploring it, by geothermal and heat pumps. Solar panels and batteries will offset 15% of the annual energy use of this project. To ensure effectiveness of the panels, this project will be insulated well in excess of our building code requirements,  They will have operable triple-pane windows, which is a benefit, and the developer has made provisions to collect composting in their solid waste enclosure should that service become available for multifamily dwellings. This project proposes 79 units.  It will be 25.24 dwelling units per acre, which seems like a silly number to give you, but I say it because it's very slightly above the maximum for the proximate zoning district, R4D, which is 25 an acre. So it's not a hyper-dense project, nor is it an extraordinarily tall project.  The maximum height of our 4D is 120 feet, and this project will be 55 feet or five stories, roughly. The project maximizes bike parking at one bike parking space per unit and minimizes car parking. That's something we like to see. 15% of the units will be permanently affordable. That amounts to 12 actual units.  And the project also closes a sidewalk gap on the west side of Maple Road between M14 and the Maple Cove development. And it adds a protected pedestrian crosswalk with a rectangular rapid flashing beacon that will span North Maple Road, which is a significant pedestrian amenity. It will connect the Garden Homes Park to the site.

Due to some timing, COVID issues, and others, that that money was going to go unspent this year. We identified the ability to move that funding to the Housing Commission and allow them to partner with OCED, potentially some of their other partners, to distribute that fund, those funds, to those who need it most quickly. That is the resolution you have in front of you.  It is designed to distribute the funds immediately to the housing commission to let them do the work they do and to partner with the county to do that as well. So that is what we're designed to do.

There's approximately 60% of those experiencing homelessness that identify as black or African-American versus only 12% of black or African-American individuals that are in the county here of Washtenaw.  An eviction can appear on a renter's credit history for up to seven years, hindering their search for safe, affordable housing due to a ripple effect of negative consequences. But beyond displacement, the impact of an eviction can also cut a renter off from access to quality public transportation, getting them to school and work. The stress of the process and the upheaval of an abrupt move can also affect a tenant's mental health.  Where here in Washtenaw County, individuals experiencing homelessness with a mental illness have gone from approximately 50% to now over 80%. And with substance abuse skyrocketing somewhere near over 300%.  Studies have shown that evictions play an important role in the lives of low-income renter households and may also contribute to poverty through cascading disruptive effects such as job losses, adverse health effects, and negative consequences for children. In addition, if you become homeless after an eviction, you're also more likely to have encounters with law enforcement,  And once released Individuals are more likely to end up in a perpetual cycle of homelessness and law law enforcement encounters So I just want to say thank you to staff for putting this together working really quickly on this and Very very happy that this is happening.", "start": 9670.51, "end": 9779.482, "Transition": "\"\"", "Meeting Section": "Other", "Speaker Role": "Other", "is_public_comment": 0, "is_public_hearing": 0, "is_comment_start_trigger": 0, "is_comment_end_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_start_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_end_trigger": 0}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_28", "text": "Thank you councilmember Watson", "start": 9779.482, "end": 9781.103, "Transition": "\"\"", "Meeting Section": "Other", "Speaker Role": "Other", "is_public_comment": 0, "is_public_hearing": 0, "is_comment_start_trigger": 0, "is_comment_end_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_start_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_end_trigger": 0}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "text": "As a liaison to Housing and Human Services Advisory Board and the Human Services Partnership Leadership Team, I'm proud to be a co-sponsor of this resolution, which is in direct response to the family homelessness crisis in our city and county.

Most of these families have never entered the system and are at lower levels of need.  which likely illustrates that more people are experiencing crises related to current economic conditions, rising rents, and food prices. 76% of the families experiencing homelessness are Black female-led households. This is absolutely a racial equity issue.  Due to market conditions and larger average family size, it's become more expensive to house families and harder to find available units within the housing stock.

This resolution is about energy justice and asks the Michigan legislature, Michigan Public Service Commission, and our city to work to improve regulation, accountability, and transparency of DTE, and for our city to continue to create equity-focused emergency response plans that prioritize vulnerable residents.  I want to thank Dr. Missy Stultz for contributing to this resolution from a climate perspective, Mr. John Fournier for sharing information on the state's role in this issue, our legal team, and Jennifer Hall for sharing information on how DTE impacts our affordable housing development. I want to thank my colleagues, Councilmember Cynthia Harrison and Lynn Song, for helping this resolution to center equity and focus on communities that have been historically disenfranchised from environmental and energy justice.  I also want to thank our city staff and emergency responders for working around the clock during the last two weeks of the recent weather events to keep our community safe. What drove myself and my colleagues to write this resolution is that during the last 12 days, you know, since the first ice storm on February 22nd hit, we have heard from so many constituents whose lives have just been upended.  I heard from a neighbor who lost power on February 22nd, and their power was up for six days, but due to caring for an ailing family member, they were unable to leave and forced to stay in their home while their thermostat hovered at 40 degrees. My Ward 3 colleague and I heard from a resident on Friday whose 89-year-old next-door neighbor had been without power for nine days, with another winter storm on the way that evening. The elderly neighbor was lucky enough to be able to stay with a family member, but not everyone has that luxury.  And I know that we've all heard from folks like this all over the city. But I want to remind us that these are just the people that have the privilege to contact us. I worry about the many who are struggling just to stay alive and didn't have the opportunity to reach out for help. And we know that people who are most marginalized are disproportionately impacted when outages occur.  Personally, I won't ever forget in 2019 when my own father father-in-law who is in hospice care at home had to be hospitalized. Not because his health took a turn for the worse, but because the power had gone out for five days and he was stuck in a hospital bed without access to necessary medical equipment. He needed to stay alive. It was traumatizing for him and it was traumatizing for all of us.  I believe that access to reliable electricity, especially in our climate and with climate change upon us, is a basic human right. And without it, people struggle to maintain employment and to stay alive. Our city has had numerous outages over the last three years that have lasted more than three days. And every time this occurs, we all end up being impacted and we all pay for it.  Am I over my three minutes? You are, I'm afraid. It's okay. Um, I just, I'll just end with saying, um, I think it's important and I welcome feedback and we have to keep DTE accountable.", "start": 9945.559, "end": 10147.124, "Transition": "\"\"", "Meeting Section": "Other", "Speaker Role": "Other", "is_public_comment": 0, "is_public_hearing": 0, "is_comment_start_trigger": 0, "is_comment_end_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_start_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_end_trigger": 0}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_28", "text": "Further discussion.", "start": 10147.124, "end": 10151.667, "Transition": "\"\"", "Meeting Section": "Other", "Speaker Role": "Other", "is_public_comment": 0, "is_public_hearing": 0, "is_comment_start_trigger": 0, "is_comment_end_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_start_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_end_trigger": 0}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_07", "text": "Councillor Song.

These units will be designed  They will not be designed in a way that specifically targets students.

So that means that it's more flexible offerings, which is really important and important for us to get that outside of downtown.

I'm sorry, I didn't raise my hand. So as the staff report makes clear, it is correct that because a component of Brownfield TIF funding is dedicated to non-environmental uses for this project, the developer would normally be required to provide a 15% affordable housing  Component or payment in lieu now it is within the discretion of council to refuse to waive this requirement Which was waived by the brownfield committee?  Council should do that if council judges that this proposal does not offer enough benefits to justify the waiver. I believe the facts and benefits of the project justify a waiver. And I want to respectfully disagree with the statement that the public is paying for the public benefits, because here's how Brownfield TIF works. We have currently a blighted site that gives us zero tax revenue.  and the developer is up front paying close to $30 million to remediate  Actually, to remediate the site. I was going to say remediate and develop, and that's not correct. To remediate the site, and about one-sixth of that amount is going to go for the public benefits that I'll speak about in a couple seconds. What will happen is that in a fixed term of years, which is fixed at 18 but projected to end after 15,  and to begin in 2025, for a fixed term of years, we will not see increased tax revenue from this site. We are getting zero now. We will get zero for 15 years while the developer is reimbursed for the upfront costs of the environmental remediation, which makes the project developable. I think we will get some tax revenue. I see you guys, maybe. So yeah, so you can, no, I guess you can't speak.  So there will be some tax revenue that we will get, and staff, Mr. Delacorte, help afterwards, please, because I just messed up a little. But, so that's, I just wanted to correct, because I think that wasn't an entirely fair statement.  But the thing that I want to say is that this is not a patronage city, and it's very rare that we in Ward 1 get to approve something that is of real benefit for our constituents. And this project, though it has not caused all of the traffic problems on Pontiac Trail, is kind of the last project to the table in terms of North Pontiac. And so these developers were willing to,  put out an additional amount of money to supplement what the city will be getting through a grant application that it will make to install an urgently needed roundabout at Duvarin and Pontiac Road. This has been a project on the city's capital improvement plan. It hasn't been funded. There are no funds for it. Without the developers' help,  We would need to come up with over a million dollars, either from the general fund, or I'm not sure where else, because mostly everything else is committed.

Collections for the month to date are 342 tons and we have expended $50,000 in order to achieve that. We still have a volume problem and we need to take various measures to address it.  Compost collection will begin one week earlier than planned and start the week of March 27th Residents will be able to place carts bags and bundled material consistent with our curbside guidelines one week earlier than planned This effort provides residents this effort  allows residents to place materials for collection in the areas field crews have already been through. So we've started the work. We realize we've got a massive effort in front of us. When we start this sweep through, we will go back where we have been previously is the point I'm trying to make.  Residents, not private contractors or landscapers can bring material to the city's compost facility that's managed by We Care Denali at 4170 Platt Road. The one cubic yard per day limit will be waived through the close of business on April 17th. We have also extended the contract with Davy Tree Expert  company with an emergency purchase order of $200,000. For full transparency with the council, I have signed that to keep the work going rather than stopping it until we could get the contract to council. We are modifying our approach by utilizing equipment  that will remove large brush piles from the curbside area, leaving only chippable material behind. So what we mean is, in simple terms, we'll use a claw to pick it up, which will allow us, again, to go faster. We have also contacted three additional companies and are trying to determine if they can help us to expedite the issue.  We estimate that it will take another month to make our way through the city. We are strongly encouraging residents to bundle per the guidelines. We will only be able to make one full sweep through the city. Residents will still be able to stage debris for pickup through the city's residential composting program, but it too must meet the curbside guidelines.  We believe we will need to expend a total of $750,000 in order to complete the suite. And I'll just say for the record, I support expending those funds and we will bring requisite contracts to council as soon as we can get them ready. But we need to keep the daily effort going.

We now have an introduction with respect to Social Work Month. Folks would come on up. Good to see you again. Good to see you. Ann Arbor is, of course, a community that you can scooch on up to get in frame. Perfect.  Ann Arbor is, of course, a community of cares and a community that works hard for its residents, for its community members. And no one cares more and no one works harder than social workers here in Ann Arbor, across Michigan, and goodness, anywhere else. And so March being Social Work Month, it is my delight to issue this proclamation.  Whereas, March 2023 is indeed Social Work Month, whereas social workers enter the profession because they have a strong desire to empower individuals, families, communities, and our nation to overcome issues that limit individuals' full potential.  And whereas social workers have worked for more than a century to improve and enhance the well-being of all people and follow a code of ethics that calls upon them to fight injustice, and whereas social work as a profession has upheld institutions of oppression and discrimination as most professions have, but with the help of our code of ethics, they strive to dismantle inequity within our profession and within society.  Whereas social workers positively touch the lives of millions of Americans each day in schools, hospitals, military, child welfare agencies, community centers, and state, federal, local government. Whereas social workers are the largest group of mental health care professionals and providers in the United States, and they help dismantle inequity through work in policy, community organizing, and research.  Whereas social workers have bettered our nation by focusing on intersectionality and advocating for equal rights for all marginal populations. Whereas the social work profession is one of the fastest growing careers in the United States, with approximately 708,000 social workers today and more than 60,000 expected to enter the profession over the next decade. Whereas Ann Arbor and greater Washtenaw County have benefited from the service and focus on alleviating inequity that social workers and leadership positions provide.  Now, therefore, I, Christopher Taylor, Mayor of Ann Arbor, in recognition of the numerous contributions made by social workers to our community, proclaim the month of March 2023 as National Social Work Month, and call upon all community members to celebrate and support the social work profession.", "start": 553.668, "end": 714.461, "Transition": "\"\"", "Meeting Section": "Other", "Speaker Role": "Other", "is_public_comment": 0, "is_public_hearing": 0, "is_comment_start_trigger": 0, "is_comment_end_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_start_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_end_trigger": 0}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_16", "text": "Thank you.

I'm honored to be here with you all today on behalf of Michigan's nearly 30,000 social workers and 6,500 students in schools of social work across our state. It's especially exciting for me to be here in home of my alma mater. Ann Arbor is host to the number one school of social work over the last decade at the University of Michigan.  You can just look around the county and see the impact that social workers have had in so many of the sectors that we work in, in developing leaders in behavioral health, non-profit management, politics, research, and clinical practice. I'd like to recognize this amazing social worker who's next to me today, who is Beth Angel, who's the Dean of the School of Social Work at the University of Michigan.  As we look around Ann Arbor, social work is everywhere. You may not know it's social work, but we are here, often behind the scenes or sometimes in front of the scenes, but maybe not with the label. From our national leading hospital system to the University Spectrum Center, the Jim Toy Community Center, our VA system, and the dozens of mental health clinics across the city. And even here on our city council, we have two MSWs with council members Ghazi Edwin and Song, so on our board here.  If we expand that out just a tiny bit further, Washtenaw County is rich in social work leaders, including the newest mayor of Ypsilanti, Nicole Brown, and the hundreds of future social workers coming out of Eastern Michigan University. Social workers are leading behavioral health efforts in the community mental health system and expanding community relations in the sheriff's office in Washtenaw County. So some places you may not expect to see our folks. And on the Washtenaw County Commission, we also have a social worker, Justin Hodge.  And at the state level, representing Ann Arbor, we have two MSWs with Carrie Reingens, our newest elected rep, and Felicia Braybeck in this county. And then at the state senate level, we have Senator Stephanie Chang, who got her MSW right here in Ann Arbor. So our social work community is rich and has ties to this Ann Arbor community.  Social work, as stated in the proclamation, we're rooted in empowering individuals, our communities, and our organizations that we work with. And we make sure to look at the intersections of micro, meso, and macro level work. As the fastest growing field in the United States, we know that we will just continue to expand our impact here in the Ann Arbor community. And so on behalf of our social work community here in Michigan, I just want to thank you all again for doing this proclamation and recognizing the essential work that social workers are doing in the community.

I am Dr. Larry Junk, a citizen of Ann Arbor, here to speak in favor of Resolution 230382. I favor asking our city to explore moving away from DTE as a supplier of fossil gas and toward alternative suppliers that will partner with Ann Arbor as the city steadily moves towards phasing out fossil fuels and moves towards carbon neutrality by 2030.  I'm a professor at University of Michigan Medical School, speaking on my own accord, but also as a volunteer for Michigan Clinicians for Climate Action.  My scientific training provides a foundation for understanding the effects of climate change on our world, and my medical training provides a foundation for understanding the health risks. To quote leading climate scientist Catherine Hayhoe, the difference between a higher versus lower emissions future is nothing less than the survival of our civilization.  I am most concerned about the following problems caused by climate change. Increasing direct heat deaths, extreme weather events causing flooding in Detroit and elsewhere, the unusual occurrence of three major hurricanes in the U.S. in the past year, widespread drought such as that affecting the western U.S., unprecedented loss of species, and threats to our agriculture and food supply.  As a physician, I'm concerned about the ongoing and severe health consequences of air pollution at present, also of mosquito-borne illnesses such as West Nile virus at present, and the threat of malaria returning to the U.S. in the future. In recent years, we have learned that the burning of fossil gas is a worse problem than previously known.  One reason is that it's drilling, fracking, transportation, and use in our homes releases substantial amounts of unburned methane, the main component of gas, which is even stronger than CO2 and causing climate change. Also, recent research shows a number of direct adverse health effects from gas leaked in our homes. DTE is far behind other energy companies in Michigan and elsewhere in moving towards sustainable sources of energy.  DTE appears to be paying little attention to the future of our climate or the health of our citizens. If this resolution passes, I urge city officials to explore the following. Is it true that DTE uses large amounts of rate payer dollars for campaign donations and for lobbying against sustainable energy?  Is it true that DTE uses my money to support their greenwashing commercials on TV, which ignore their foot dragging with sustainable energy?  And finally, is it true that four months ago DTE requested that the Michigan Public Service Commission approve large rate increases to protect high pay for its executives and high return to its shareholders? High pay and high returns to shareholders seem inappropriate for a company like DTE that fights to preserve generation of dirty energy using 20th century technology.

Yes, this is Vince Caruso, 556 Bundell Circle.  a coordinating member and founding member of the Allens Creek Watershed Group, board and founding member of CARD, Coalition for Action and Remediation, and a former elected executive committee member of the Sierra Club Durham Valley Group. I'm calling tonight to state that putting residential housing at 415 West Washington would be a major mistake and very dangerous. New discussions at City Hall regarding development at 415  for residential ill-advised. The Palms Creek Group does not support this proposal. We communicated this to the City Council and Planning Commission several times. Earth Street Foundation, which is an open source flood modeling group, has been closely working with the Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, in recent years to update and greatly update the lowfall current floodplain maps of up to 33%  but they really are, and FEMA agrees. FEMA is now working on FEMA 2.0 to update their maps that they say are not accurate. Our current city leaders pretend to plan for global warming, but propose building residential, no less, in dangerous floodplain locations. For some reason, city officials failed to involve Harry Hancock in the evaluation of 415 plan. Planning officials stated, oh, our bad.  Jerry made comment anyway. Jerry Hancock, the city's stormwater and floodplain programs coordinator, raised concerns about the development proposal saying putting a large residential structure in the flood zone is inconsistent with the city's flood mitigation policy. Since 2004, the city's policy has been to look for opportunities to purchase floodplain properties and demolish structures. Chemicals on this site are set to be planted, to be cleaned, or treated, but may float  in flood water if a flood occurs, in addition to the chemicals coming from all the flooded cars on the site. These chemicals will migrate into the neighborhoods and contaminate homes in the Old West Side. R-15 West Washington site was flooded in 1968 in a 100-year flood. Reliable sources, it was more like a 50-year rain. When a meeting of city officials, the Watershed Council, and county officials were meeting in the building,  to discuss flood hazards. 30 seconds. And it seemed to be a drain commissioner with an attendant. His car was flooded in total, and they were trapped in this building.

I am personally quite excited to see this project advance. I think the public benefits provided by it are really important to the city. And so I'm hoping you will not only approve this rezoning request, but take whatever steps are prudent to ensure that the project actually succeeds, it actually gets built, and actually provides all the promised benefits.  So talking about the benefits, as proposed, this PUD would involve remediating the environmental contamination on the site, would reactivate a long blighted site and put it to productive uses, adding badly needed market rates and affordable housing on site, and then the proceeds would help fund other affordable housing projects elsewhere in the city. This last bit is particularly important because we are seeing development costs continue to rise for affordable housing projects.  As I recall, there was a recent memo about the Catherine and fourth project discussing that increased costs are already becoming a problem. So our affordable housing millage is not enough. We need to take every opportunity we can get to supplement it. And this project would do that. However, it's clear. Also, this is going to be a difficult project to develop.  It requires environmental remediation. There are several additional restrictions in these proposed PUD regulations, including preventing construction in the floodway, requiring that the chimney be preserved, requiring that a segment of the treeline trail be constructed. By the way, on the last point, the proposed ordinance specifically requires collaboration with the Treeline Conservancy, which is a private nonprofit  By name in the ordinance, and I'm not I'm not sure if it's actually appropriate to or proper to name a private entity in a zoning ordinance like that. Maybe maybe I'll could look into that anyway.  The point here, I saw in Council Member Briggs' newsletter that she's planning to propose an amendment that would add even more development restrictions to this site around green building requirements. And I can certainly appreciate the intent behind this, but I would ask, has anyone evaluated whether such an amendment would impact the feasibility of this project?

I hope you had a chance to look at the material I sent yesterday that illustrates a little bit what I'll be talking about. As you know, you directed staff to restore the two and a half feet that were taken away from the bridge and the design to the west sidewalk on the bridge to make it ten and a half feet like it is. Now,  It may turn out that doing that requires adding an additional beam underneath the bridge. If that's the case, then it potentially could be six feet added there rather than two and a half feet, because the existing beams on the bridge that are there both now and in the current plan are just about six feet across, five feet, 11 inches, and a little bit more.  So it might be possible at minimal cost to widen that sidewalk. The main cost isn't the decking on the top. The main cost is the support structure underneath. So if we can get, using basically the same support structure, get some added width on that sidewalk, that would be beneficial.  And then instead of having a 10 and a half foot sidewalk there, we could have a 14 foot sidewalk with room for bi-directional bike lanes and a pedestrian lane. And in turn, that would connect to the planned trail loop under the bridge, which we hope to have built before too long and make it better for everybody and safer and more comfortable for bikers and walkers. Council Member Rodina responded to me, and I appreciate the comment, that the  issue before you says at least 10 1\u9226? feet on that bridge. And that's good that it says that, but it doesn't say to try to go more. What I would ask is that the council direct staff to investigate the possibility of making that addition wider than 2 1\u9226? feet, make it up to maybe 6 feet, so that we end up with a very safe and usable wider sidewalk there. So if we can make that  direction in some way to staff that would be beneficial, I think.

As a 30-year real estate professional, including experience as a developer, with your zonings in multiple communities, I want to speak about the latest in a pattern of problematic zoning actions noticed by experts in planning and zoning over the past several years.  The application for 415 West Washington clearly does not meet the intent of multiple laws and policies. Our policies do not intend for development such as this, at this location, which is in a historic district and almost entirely in a floodplain. The proposal is for a PUD based on D2 zoning baseline characteristics. D2 permits a maximum height of 60 feet tall, with 70 feet achievable with a premium.  However, the UDC states, quote, premium options may be applied only to lots that are located entirely out of a historic district and that contain no part of a floodplain. The D2 premium is clearly not to be used at this location. The proposal instead uses a planned development to achieve this very same thing, 70 feet instead of 60 feet, linked to a similar affordable housing premium.  Yet the UDC says that a PUD quote, shall not be allowed where it's sought primarily to avoid the imposition of standards and requirements of other zoning classifications or other city regulations. There's a more recently added premium that allows 30% additional height in exchange for affordable housing or sustainability. The applicant is basing its justification on this newer premium.  that replaced planned projects after the Lower Town lawsuit demonstrated that planned project section of the UDC was not in compliance with the Michigan Zoning Enabling Act. This newer premium makes no mention of historic districts nor floodplains. Since the intent is very clear in the first premium ordinance language, these two sections are thus in conflict.  The UDC speaks to that. Quote, where conditions, standards, or requirements imposed by any provisions of this chapter are either more restrictive or less restrictive than comparable standards imposed by any other law, ordinance, or regulation, the provisions that are more restrictive or that impose higher standards or requirements shall govern. So we are left with the intent of the UDC to not exceed the standard D2 height maximum of 60 feet in a historic district or in a floodplain which both  apply to this location. Additionally, the historic district guidelines have not been followed. They state that new buildings are to be designed to be compatible with surrounding buildings that contribute to the overall character of the historic district in terms of height, form, size, scale, massing proportions, and roof shape. This has not been designed to be compatible with the contributing structures in the historic district.  Please reject this application and send it back to follow our laws and policies.

We oppose the Earhart Road 2023 project. Although we were promised meetings with our city council members and the project engineers, they have not occurred. We want to know why you would accept a design that diminishes the level of service  As reported in a memo dated February 15th, 2019 from Grace Crow and Cynthia Redinger to Nick Hutchinson. Where's the data to justify spending taxpayer money on projects that reduce the level of service? Also the city's uniform development code stipulates that proposals contributing to a level of service of D, E, or F can be denied by city council. Why should the same stipulation not only apply to existing roads when implementing road diets?  We believe there is room to consider more than one design scenario, as was done for the Gettys Road Improvement Project. The city collaborated with private property owners and made adjustments which resulted in fewer trees destroyed, a shared use path, and bike lanes. Since Earhart Road currently has four lanes and the proposal reduces the road to two lanes, there is sufficient room for other design scenarios. As proposed, the city will paint Chevron lines over excess road surface.  Let's move the driving lane closer to the median and use the excess road for a bike lane and a walking path or a larger shared path. Constructing a sidewalk outside of the existing road will increase the overall width of the corridor. Keeping intact the existing property line and mature trees creates a narrow road visual, a known factor in reducing auto speeds. Additionally, the Route 3 bus stop at the corner of Earhart and Gettys is located just west of Earhart Road.  So most using the stop would have used the existing western sidewalk. All of the schools, churches, and other tributary streets to King Elementary Schools are on or connect to the western sidewalk. All residents living on the eastern side must cross Terre Heart Road at some point to reach those destinations. They will use the closest crosswalk to get on the west side of the street. The goal should be reducing overall road speed and on creating adequate and properly designed crosswalk  rather than creating a sidewalk to nowhere with gaps that will remain into perpetuity, like in front of Oxford Cemetery and Pineberry Street.

And they are quoted in our own city website as recommending that, quote, residential uses in the floodplain be discouraged, end quote.  That, to me, is a very clear recommendation. Don't build residential in the floodplain. Locally, we have Jerry Hancock, our stormwater and floodplain programs coordinator. In his memo to the planning department dated February 6th of this year, he says, quote, for the past 19 years, the policy direction the city has taken for floodplain mitigation  through the various hazard mitigation plans has been to look for opportunities to purchase property, demolish structures, and lower the intensity of use in the floodplain. The concept plan to sell 415 Washington, this city-owned parcel, works at cross purposes to the city's floodplain mitigation efforts,\" end quote. But Mr. Hancock's memo does not  mentioned the toxins in the 415 West Washington site. Lucky for us, Rita La Caruso, Professor Emerita U of M, addresses the toxins in her March 17 letter to our mayor and city council. Her letter reminds us of two things.

Second, her letter reminds us that, quote,  Because of flooding risk, the possibility that flood water will carry pollutants beyond the site requires careful, knowledgeable analysis,\" end quote.

Does the cost differ for use, if it's a park,  for residential or commercial uses? I was just recently told by my city council people that the cost is between one and three million, but for what use? Where is the data on this? How can the city make an informed decision with public support without the actual cost revealed? Whatever the cost, the city and the county need to find the money to clean this site up now.  We have a lot of bright minds in this city who could find ways, other than waiting, on a might-be developer. Don't wait. Please, don't shift the city's responsibility to clean the site up. Please, clean this up now. The health and well-being of our community depends on it.

Thank you. I just wanted to take a minute to mention something that's actually schools related. But we talk a lot about equity here. And there is a really important initiative right now, a fundraiser going on within the school district. The PTO Council, which is a group with representatives from every PTO throughout the Ann Arbor Public Schools, is doing a fundraiser.  This is the first of its kind. It's to raise money for Title I schools within the district for their PTO, to help fund and equalize their PTO budgets. This is a really important thing to me. I just donated today and I encourage everybody to donate if you can.  When I first became engaged with the schools, my daughter was a kindergartner at Dickin Elementary and it was a Title I school at the time. It has been on and off throughout the years. And I was shocked to learn that my daughter's school really struggled to fundraise.  to fund basic teacher supplies, classroom supplies, and the very basic field trips for our kids, while there were other schools in the district that could afford, through their PTO donations, to send every fifth grader to space camp.  every year. There are huge inequities within our district and you know back then I remember raising it at a PTOC meeting and it just wasn't something that people were interested in at the time but I'm really happy to see that folks have continued to work at it over the years and we're now seeing some interest in  somehow creating a little more equity between our schools. This is an issue that has only become exacerbated by the district's schools of choice within the district, the ability for folks to transfer to any school they want, and sometimes that ends up robbing schools of  resources. And so I really, again, I applaud the PTOC for taking this on. I hope it becomes an annual thing. I hope it will grow over the years. And I encourage anyone, they're just asking for 20 bucks.

They started with 200 and now operate 400. And some of you might remember a bike share program that we had several years ago that I think were mainly docked at the downtown branch of the library. It wasn't very successful, so it went away. And so there's long been talk of relaunching a bike share.  So we've been without bike share since 2017. This extension to this agreement with the scooters would be 100 dockless bikes, e-bikes to start. We would see how well it works. We want to make sure that there's not nuisances that come about and just learn our way around this and it doesn't lead to obstructions. We'll monitor and then hopefully we'll be able to expand it. I wanted to highlight some of the  cool things about what they're doing. So one thing that they're doing starting February 1st with the scooters and will extend to the bikes is equity considerations. So they have an access program which allows for people in affordable housing or of moderate means to get a reduced fee. And they've already established some relationships with our affordable housing complexes. They also have a special card that you can get so that you can use their vehicles without having a credit card, bank, or smartphone.  So really what we're trying to do is brought an opportunity to these devices One thing that the data nerd and me is excited about is that they have to share their data with us These are aggregate data not personally identifying But it can show us where use is strongest and where paths are being taken and I think that's going to help us a lot with our mobility planning so I'm really excited to support this tonight as a way of further advancing our mobility goals and Furthering our transportation plan.", "start": 3825.215, "end": 3946.928, "Transition": "\"\"", "Meeting Section": "Other", "Speaker Role": "Other", "is_public_comment": 0, "is_public_hearing": 0, "is_comment_start_trigger": 0, "is_comment_end_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_start_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_end_trigger": 0}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_15", "text": "Thank you further discussion  All in favor?

Right now, our economic development efforts are centered around what our local development finance authority and the state direct us to do in terms of competitiveness, which is deemed driving industries. It's a very narrow focus. High tech industries, biotech, IT, you can look it up on the state's website, but there are five focuses, advanced automotive,  This would, in my mind, and to Councilmember Briggs' point, really expand that view and really be informative around where are the gaps, where can we better support business attraction, retention, acceleration, talent attraction, enhancement. I'd like to see what those gaps are and to really understand it so that as going forward, the city can develop an economic development strategy that meets not only the needs of those driving industry businesses, but the businesses on Main Street, other new emerging industries that might  afford us economic advantage and economic opportunity in the city. So I'm enthusiastic to do that. I think that some of the thought around, um, filling those gaps, um, should be part of the process of developing which cities to go to and benchmark against and which questions we ask. Um, and I'm hopeful for that data to really be a powerful source of truth for us as we come up with an academic development strategy for the citywide council member.", "start": 4049.26, "end": 4180.821, "Transition": "\"\"", "Meeting Section": "Other", "Speaker Role": "Other", "is_public_comment": 0, "is_public_hearing": 0, "is_comment_start_trigger": 0, "is_comment_end_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_start_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_end_trigger": 0}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_30", "text": "Thank you.

There are other pieces in motion. The Economic Development Corporation, of course, which I've talked about before, has broadened its mission to take a more active role in economic development activities in the city.

Thank you for having me here tonight. There were four questions that were posed to us, and I'd like to address those in the order in which I will receive them. The first is the purpose or the goals of the negotiation. To answer this question, I'd like to first start by stating what a franchise is.  Under Michigan law, a franchise is a contract between a local unit of government and a utility that does two things. One governs the use of the public rights of way and second sets the conditions under which the company may for a set period provide the specified utility service.  Franchises can also include additional terms, and several local governments across the country have successfully advanced affordability, equity, and clean energy goals via franchise negotiations, while also optimizing the use of public rights of way. In Michigan, you need to have a franchise to provide a service in the community.  Given the importance of the franchise and the reality that our existing franchise for natural gas provision expires in 2027, staff believe we should start negotiating a new franchise agreement as soon as possible and work to begin immediately ensuring that this new franchise aligns with our 820 goals, including ensuring that residents have choices that allow them to heat their homes and businesses with safe, healthy, clean, affordable, and stably priced fuel. Second question.  how this activity has the potential to advance our A20 goals. Staff believe that no resident should be forced to pay for energy that negatively impacts their health and safety and that is hazardous to our community.  That's why we see upcoming franchise discussions as an opportunity to provide residents with energy choices that are, as mentioned previously, safe, healthy, affordable, and clean. And this is where the franchise most directly intersects with A20, by exploring options that will allow us to heat our homes and businesses with clean, renewable, and affordable energy. This directly aligns with our A20 goals, specifically strategies two and three. Third question. Why this wasn't discussed earlier is an option.  As mentioned previously, our existing franchise doesn't expire until 2027.  is part of our work to help the community transition towards more sustainable sources of heating and cooling. Staff have been reviewing a slew of documents, including the city's existing franchise. Upon review, we noted the expiration date, as well as the fact that the franchise is terminable at will. Now, it's important at this point to note that historically, franchises have almost always exclusively focused on the terms governing the use of the public rights of way, or that first purpose I mentioned previously.  But given community discussions around achievement of a to zero staff began reviewing opportunities to advance the second purpose of a franchise, which is setting the conditions under which a company may for a set period of time provide a specified utility service.  This led staff to begin researching how other communities have advanced their climate and equity goals when selecting their utility providers. After several conversations with peer cities, a decision was made by staff to bring tonight's resolution forward to ensure we are notifying decision makers, the public, and potential providers, as soon as possible, about the city's opportunity to negotiate this new peaking franchise  and ensure it's consistent with best practices, certainly regarding use of rights of way, as well as full alignment with A20 and the city's affordability goals. And finally, fourth question, how community members' commissions will be included as we proceed forward.  If Council approves the resolution before you tonight, we will shortly announce a series of public meetings to share more details about what the franchise is as well as what is it is not and gather ideas from the public about what they would like to see included in a new heating franchise.  We also anticipate having a special discussion with the city's Energy Commission on the topic and opening a new email address where folks can send ideas and suggestions at any point.  Additionally, if the resolution passes, staff will prepare a formal request for ideas where Ann Arborites and potential utility providers or energy providers can send their ideas about how the city could achieve a careful transition to renewable energy choices for heating all of our Ann Arbor homes and businesses. Finally, staff have already launched a new city website to keep the public apprised of work on the heating franchise, and we will continue to keep that up to date.

You know, studies have shown the negative health effects of burning fossil fuels in our homes. And, you know, no person should have to sacrifice their health and their safety and their well-being in order to heat their home or their business.  So we are committed to this work of transitioning to a clean energy future while also improving, and this is a very important point, improving the reliability and the resilience and the safety and affordability of the city's energy.  Finally, what we do here in Ann Arbor, this is really exciting to me because what we do here in Ann Arbor can really serve as a model nationwide.

But there are other choices that are available. Certainly within A20 we are looking to prioritize and help people make the transition should they want to, to keep homes in greater efficiency. But there are other things like  For example, geothermal or different heating technologies that might actually prove more viable.

We all know that the status quo is not acceptable. Ann Arbor residents, we deserve reliable, affordable, clean, healthy energy to heat and power our homes. By beginning these discussions,  We are looking to facilitate more energy choices for residents. We are listening to the vast majority of Ann Arbor residents, Ann Arbor voters, who supported our A20 plan in November. By their vote, what Ann Arborites did is demand that we transition away from fossil fuels, that we reduce in-home pollution that leads to asthma, cancer, and lung disease, and that we take aggressive steps to achieve our goal of community-wide carbon neutrality by 2030.

I did want to comment on this, and so I appreciate the mayor's getting that straightened out and allowing this comment. This may seem like a small point to many of you, but I think that these types of claims  and the way their process does provide an important window that council can look in on staff and see how the staff is interacting with the public. And for that reason, I don't think you should change the current process. Ms. Briggs' proposed change to ask for a reporting on it is a partial solution.  But it doesn't really solve the problem of really eliminating your watching staff interact with residents. And I sent you a detailed email a couple of weeks ago when this came up the first time, first reading. And I won't go into the detail of that. But the gist of it was that I had what I thought was a totally merited small sewer claim.  It was initially denied. The person I talked to about that denial letter said, well, the city staff said they didn't cause your sewer backup, so therefore we denied the appeal. I went to an appeal hearing. I'm a retired lawyer. I went there. I had an expert witness from Dynamic Drain who cleared the backup in the drain. They said it was inconceivable that any other, there was no other possibility  other than the repair of the water main break in front of my house as to what caused that. The city attorney, a young lawyer whose name escapes me now, was pretty assertive and pretty aggressive, I would say, in saying, look, you can't prove that. I reminded him of the first year torts case, Paul's graph, which for you non-lawyers says, you know, if there's a giant explosion, you can assume it came from,  a particular train engine if it blew up the train. And that principle means you don't have to prove the details of something like that. And the appeal was denied again. And this was a little disconcerting. I don't think anybody without a law degree would have maybe gotten that far. And I had essentially threatened to go to court for small claims over it in order to get anything. I got another denial letter. And then it was with a settlement offer  $950 on an $1,100 claim. I took that, I had to dice with Abby Elias for several months about the settlement agreement because it was clearly an appropriate settlement agreement. I finally got paid almost a year later. I don't think that that was an appropriate way to deal with a pretty simple claim of a taxpayer.  I'm not saying current staff would have done that or the lawyer's office would have done that, but you would never, you're never going to know how these claims are being handled unless you actually watch them. That's all I have. I don't want it to sound like sour grapes. That's really not the point. The point is that it's a window into how staff interacts with the public, and that's very important, and I don't think you should eliminate that opportunity.

Good evening, Mayor and Council. Derek Delacorte, I'm the Community Services Administrator for the city. We did receive about eight questions related to the site tonight. We're going to do our best to answer them up front here, and then obviously both Mr. Leonard and I will be here to answer any questions regarding the project as we go forward. Quickly, I'm going to state up front that the project, the proposed PUD, is in response to City Council Resolution 2662.  that directed staff to present recommendations for redevelopment of the site, along with many others in the city, primarily for consideration of residential use. We've been at this for a considerable amount of time and are grateful to be here tonight to discuss it. The first question we have is a request for an amendment language to include sustainability requirements into supplemental regulations for 415 West Washington. It's stated that the goal is that any future building maximizes energy efficiency and is aligned with the goals of 820.  The question states, as I think all of us prefer that a building be net zero, but is willing to consider net zero ready, if that is more viable at this time. Staff and OSI, planning staff and OSI discussed this today and offered some language both in an email that was sent out to the asker and those who were CC'd on it and read in summary in the following. If it is desired to add proposed language, the following language,  is proposed by planning and OSI and can be added to the supplemental regulations. The referenced sustainability component of the UDC is defined as follows. When and where a solar collector surface covers at least 60% of the building's footprint area on a site and the electrical panels of the buildings have capacity to solely power the site by electricity, including any conduit and other necessary infrastructure for future conversions, this complete electrification is not achievable  at the time of initial construction. So the amendment would be the addition of the following language to the supplemental regulations, section four, PD regulations, G, any development of the property shall comply with the sustainability component of the unified development code. That is very briefly would apply that section of code to any project that came forward to the city in the future. Question two.  Has the city considered the option to clean up the site to recreation standards with the aim to absorb and conduct stormwater? As I understand, we have with other floodplain properties the city has purchased. If so, what would be the cost and how could that be funded? Answer recreational standards are determined on a site-by-site basis in consultation with the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy.  As staff has been working from the direction of the city council to explore housing for this location, the site has not been evaluated for stormwater infrastructure as its primary use. It is estimated that the cost of the environmental remediation for recreation would be similar to or higher than the estimated cost of residential cleanup. That is primarily due to concerns are increased when you have a recreational use about direct contact with soil and other use on the property.  As the city is likely a responsible party when it comes for paying for the remediation, it would be responsible for cleanup of contamination at the site without the benefit of any private investment to provide financial support through tax increment financing. Thus, the only real vehicle we know of right now that could cover those costs would be the general fund. Question three, have we considered the benefits  Perhaps in terms of savings on flood insurance, reducing flooding to surrounding properties, savings of emergency city response of making the site a floodway park. Response flood insurance rates are established citywide, while the decisions that the city collectively makes on property regulations and other measures can impact the city's flood insurance rates positively or negatively.  This is reviewed at a community-wide scale and does not fluctuate based on individual site decisions. Question four, floodplain maps. Can we trust these? Some have suggested that FEMA maps are inaccurate and outdated and the floodway floodplain is likely larger. Parentheses plus climate change. FEMA maps are the maps of record to base numerous policy decisions on  such as the floodplain overlay district adopted in 2021, which includes 415 West Washington. Actual onsite elevations are further used to delineate floodplain impacts on any site. And it has been stated, I think, on several occasions with this site, everything that is proposed and everything that will come forward to council will meet that recently adopted floodplain ordinance for the city in regards to these regulations.  Question five, does our remediation plan explicitly take into account that the site is a floodplain and permeable barriers work when there is flooding? Answer, yes. These barriers work in an area with flooding as it is often corresponds to a water table that is conducive to moving contaminants through the barriers to provide treatment. Question six, is the height of 70 feet in conflict with what is allowable in D2?  Answer, no. The height limit for this site in the D2 would be 70 or 78 feet, depending on the provisions of the Unified Development Code. Question seven. Is it accurate that the HDC has said they would reject a development that maximized the elements in the supplemental regulations? If so, are we presenting developers with a concept plan that may not be successful when it goes in front of the HDC in the future?  Response, at the recent working session, the Historic District Commission expressed concern should the project maximize the building envelope. However, it is also difficult for the commission to apply the Secretary of Interior Standards, which govern their review, to conceptual massing diagrams presented to date. The proposed PUD provides a limit, which any proposal will need to work within to meet the approval of the commission.  As demonstrated by ongoing dialogue with the Historic District Commission, they remain an important partner as the city moves forward with the design of the site with any development partner. And as you'll hear Brett and I talk about repeatedly tonight, at this point, it is important that we, we believe it's important to bring that development partner into the process so we can further provide the details the HDC needs to make such decisions. Ultimately, they have that authority to make an up or down decision on the outside  elements of the site. Would the cost be lower or higher for remediation if we weren't going to place housing on the site and we're seeking to convert the site to green space? In our conversations with our environmental folks, likely higher. As less physical development occurs on the site, the design, monitoring, and effectiveness of the permeable reactive barriers would become more critical as any design elements would need to address potential exposures that contaminate  For example, a stormwater pond or other recreational uses on site would provide a greater opportunity for potential contamination exposure than equivalent conditions under a building or parking area. I.e., if the site is recreational or not capped, the possibilities of direct connection to the contamination increase. Therefore, the cost of remediation goes up.  Again, as we've gone through this process, staff has been directed to this point to consider housing for the site, recreation and open space. It was not the direction of the council at this point. But we did have some time today to talk to our environmental experts. And that was how they advised us today on the site. That's all for the pre-printed questions. And obviously, we're here to answer anything else you may have as the discussion goes forward.", "start": 5935.419, "end": 6445.355, "Transition": "\"\"", "Meeting Section": "Other", "Speaker Role": "Other", "is_public_comment": 0, "is_public_hearing": 0, "is_comment_start_trigger": 0, "is_comment_end_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_start_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_end_trigger": 0}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_15", "text": "Thank you.

We are asked to rezone and approve for residential development a 2.5 acre site located in the Old West Side Historic District in the Allen Creek floodplain.

There will be a minimum of 60% of the site required to be preserved as open space. And either the greater of 15% or 15 units of affordable housing is also required, can be done on site or by payment in lieu, as is construction of a segment of the tree line trail.

Staff advises us, as you've heard, that our best strategy  For meeting that responsibility, cleaning up the site and serving affordable housing goals is to sell the site to a private developer and make a brownfield plan. A viable brownfield plan will necessitate residential development and we have specified with this PUD that it will require affordable housing payment in lieu or units.  We have heard concerns about pursuing residential development in a floodplain. Let me underscore that this PUD zoning will ensure considerably better floodwater management than what currently exists. It replaces a structure that sits below the floodplain, provides stormwater management where there is none, significantly reduces impervious surface, and conforms fully with the city's revised and strengthened floodplain ordinance, which council approved in January 2021.  That ordinance requires residential construction in the flood fringe, not the floodway, because you can't do it there, to be elevated one foot over a flood level that has a 0.2 or 1 in 500 annual chance of occurring. The city's floodplain staff wrote that ordinance to guide safe residential development in the flood fringe. The city's floodplain staff also wrote a hazard mitigation plan whose aspirational goals are higher than the standards of the ordinance. Council Member? Yes, I can come back to this.

As usual, Council Member Dish has covered a number of the critical details about the project and I'm sure she'll have more to share. I'd like to start by thanking Mr. Delacorte and Mr. Leonard and other planning staff for their extensive work on this really difficult site. What we have before us is a project that cleans up a polluted and blighted site in the Fifth Ward and advances a number of our community priorities.  Council Member Desch mentioned many of them, but just to review, we're mediating the environmental contamination, we're adding affordable housing in addition to likely other housing on the site or funding for affordable housing, protecting the chimney's swift habitat, where it would be construction of a 15-foot wide path with a tree-lined trail.  On and on, we are seeing improvements on this site. But I'd also like to thank the many residents who've reached out to me about this project, both in support and with concerns. The concerns, as we heard in public comment, primarily have centered around compatibility with the historic district and floodplain concerns. The HDC has reviewed and provided recommendations that have informed the supplemental regulations and concept plan, and they will need to approve the final plan.  Early on, the floodplain issues were what gave me the most pause with this project, and that's why one of the first things that Council Member Dish and I did after starting our terms was to sit down with numerous staff members from multiple specialty areas to discuss the trade-offs on this site. And Council Member Dish noted all the improvements that we're seeing in terms of floodplain management, so I'm not gonna review those. The one thing that I do think is worth discussing a little bit more tonight  is there's one piece that's missing from the supplemental regulations that is a community priority, and a pretty critical community priority. And that is the alignment with any future development with our A20 plan. So I'm looking at this through an environmental lens. Primarily, there's a lot of issues that are going  prioritized on this site, but fundamentally we are seeking to clean up a environmentally contaminated site in the Fifth Ward on a flood plain. What we put back there needs to be something that is not contributing to climate change, in my opinion, that is beneficial to the environment. So I'd like to put forward a motion.

First off, I just wanted to recognize that I'm coming in at the end of what I have learned has been a years-long process to identify a solution for the splited property in a flood zone. And I really appreciate the work of planning staff, planning commission, community members to identify a way forward. I think there's a lot of considerations with this project.  that don't make the decision necessarily a simple, easy, straightforward one, which probably explains why it has sat like it is for so long. So I just wanted to say a few words about the values that I'm thinking about as concerns the PUD before us.  Number one, the creation of desperately needed housing for our city, including affordable housing. We're in a housing crisis. I plan to take every opportunity I can to address this issue by making sure that we add more housing where it makes sense. Two, as has been mentioned, the cleanup and toxic remediation of the site. We know this site is a brownfield containing toxic pollution and it is spreading under the street to the surrounding area. It needs to be cleaned up.  So we don't want it to continue sitting in the state that it is. Three, that it's done responsibly and with climate change and community resilience in mind.  As I said, this property is in a flood plain, something that several residents have reached out to us about. We know that we're experiencing more extreme weather-related events, such as flooding. And our community in the greater state of Michigan is poised to be a climate refuge. And as spelled out in our A20 plan, we know that we need to build resilience to climate change, which is something that I really value.  So when I grappled on this topic about whether this was environmentally sound or puts our community in danger, I was looking at the plans that specifically dealt with this. And I think as Council Member Dish said, we need to recognize that what's being proposed is a vast improvement from a flooding perspective than what has been sitting there for decades.  Also, the PUD turns the entire floodway into the treeline trail, which is a massive community benefit. Right now, it's covered by impervious surface. Second, the residential portion is in the flood fringe and would fully conform, or if I understand Mr. Delacorte's comments tonight, exceeds the recently adopted city ordinance that stipulates how residential developments can be built in our city today.  Lastly, it's important that we have a way to pay for it. This is going to be expensive. Now we know it's going to be even more expensive if it's for simply just recreational use with no residential. This plan doesn't put the city on the line to pay for it. Again, something that has been sitting there for years with no solution. So those are the things that I'm thinking about as I consider this.", "start": 6938.582, "end": 7111.946, "Transition": "\"\"", "Meeting Section": "Other", "Speaker Role": "Other", "is_public_comment": 0, "is_public_hearing": 0, "is_comment_start_trigger": 0, "is_comment_end_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_start_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_end_trigger": 0}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_15", "text": "Thank you.

Those are both really eloquent comments.

Want to say that the ordinance is and should be not just that it is legal to legally But it should be the deciding standard The ordinance provides guardrails for making prudent land use decisions in a context where we seek the best balance between stormwater management and other city priorities such as Councilmember Ackman just mentioned  situating housing within walking distance of jobs and services. The floodplain concerns people have raised with respect to 415 West Washington aren't really about this site. They raise the broader question whether we trust the ordinance that floodplain staff has written and council passed just over two years ago. If we want to change the floodplain ordinance to match our aspirational goals for stormwater management, we can do that. But we need to ask ourselves how the urgent concern about housing supply in the city stacks up against  an ideal standard of meeting our highest aspirations regarding structures in the flood fringe. And I will underscore what Council Member Ackman just said, which is that if council opted to turn the property into a park without any residential use on it, the work of demolishing the structure, remediating the contamination to the highest level, and preserving the habitat would cost millions of dollars for which we have no funding source other than the general fund which is committed  Moreover, I would like to say that this process was designed to provide us with what staff considers to be a feasible project and a good balance among competing city priorities.

I want to address some things that I had heard. Council Member Briggs and I had our monthly coffee, or office hours, or however you want to phrase it, yesterday. And as you can imagine, this really dominated the conversation. And I wanted to make sure that I addressed some of what we heard.  And we heard, I heard, I should say, that this action feels rushed and sudden, which seems very confusing to me because although I'm new to council, this has been on my radar for years. As a fourth ward resident being invited to participate in public comment on it, there was a survey around it. I think that the city has done a lot of work.  Around this property and I really applaud city staffers for sticking with it so I just I want to highlight that again that this is not something that is brand new and sprung up and you know, we're trying to Rush I think that it's been a very thoughtful process to date and  I want to point out that there's been criticism of neighborhood character, talking about whether or not this should be a park. I think Council Member Dish brought up some really important points that if the city opted to turn this property into a park, it would need to identify funding for the demolition of structures, the remediation of environmental contaminants, construction of the tree line trail, and preserving of the chimney for the birds.  which would total millions of dollars that is unbudgeted from city funds. So truly, we would need to rob Peter to pay Paul to accommodate some of these. And we know from our pros plan that the city does have an ambitious parks and recreation plan, and funding has been thoughtfully dedicated toward those priorities that were informed by the community at large. I think that's a really important point to this. I think it's also noteworthy that our partner in this,  the Treeline Trail, has also identified that there is no available city funding for this type of project in terms of creating recreational space on this site. And that creating and funding its perpetual maintenance is beyond the scope of Treeline's mission. So again, this becomes the city's responsibility.  The other thing that I want to point out is that when we talk about brownfield credits, there's been a lot of talk about the city assuming responsibility for this, cleaning things up. That is exactly what this tax increment funding is there for. This TIF capture is tax dollars that the state returns to local.  So governments, in order to advance important projects within the community, this is exactly what this tax credit is designed for. It is a common economic development tool. It is not one that's being pulled out of a magic bag to pay for this. We see it in terms of our own funding.  TIF funding is used for Ann Arbor Spark activity. It's used for DDA activity. This is not new here in the city, nor is it new anywhere in the United States in terms of it being an economic development tool. I think that this site is walkable, obviously. I walk through the site every day on my way to work. It is walkable. It's close to town and transit. And I think that this would be a highly desirable property for a developer to acquire.  I'm interested in hearing feedback from colleagues on the sustainability aspects of this property development. I think if this is one we're going to swing for the fences, it's the opportunity to do so. And I think that the plans that the city has put forth right now in order to do this checks so many of those boxes and is already quite ambitious. I already mentioned the Chimney Swifts, the Treeline Trail, developing a new West Washington streetscape, which I think is really important. And it also provides setbacks that are greater than what is required.  Increases our flood storage capacity in the floodplain. That was some around the flooding issues and safety That was a lot of feedback that we have heard consistently And it reduces the impervious surfaces on that floodplain While counseling using the building coverage in that floodplain, so I'm supportive of this further discussion Councilmember Briggs All right, sorry for that procedural nightmare for a little bit I", "start": 7783.561, "end": 8041.815, "Transition": "\"\"", "Meeting Section": "Other", "Speaker Role": "Other", "is_public_comment": 0, "is_public_hearing": 0, "is_comment_start_trigger": 0, "is_comment_end_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_start_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_end_trigger": 0}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_06", "text": "To go back to the sustainability component, so the supplemental regulations are the guidelines that we're going to be going out to the development community and asking, they're sort of the guardrails for this project.

I am looking at what we're doing on other city-owned sites. Our affordable housing, where we're maximizing affordable housing, those are all the 121 East Catherine that we approved the transfer of ownership to the Ann Arbor Housing Development Corporation. It's going to be going to Planning Commission tomorrow.  and the language in that is extensive on it being a net zero ready building and discusses many energy efficiency elements that we expect to see as a part of that project. And so I think there are sort of expectations about what we want to see out of a building, out of a PUD in our city. So I know from my perspective that's really important when we eventually get a development back to us that it is in alignment  what voters have approved through our climate millage. It's in alignment with our A20 plan. So, you know, I think it's, in terms of the language that was suggested here, in terms of amending the regulations, I would have supported that tonight. I think that that's essentially the intent, is to at least have an A20-ready building, if not more. You know, this is a site that's in the flood plain, obviously, having features that  eliminate runoff, water runoff on the building like a green roof are also obviously important elements in a project like this. In terms of the specificity, obviously we don't have a developer at the table yet, so it's very difficult to outline that we want X, Y, and Z out of this. But I do think that we, I hope that we're all in agreement in terms of the types of building that we would wanna see built on this site in terms of general direction that we would want a developer to come back to us with.", "start": 8042.41, "end": 8203.503, "Transition": "\"\"", "Meeting Section": "Other", "Speaker Role": "Other", "is_public_comment": 0, "is_public_hearing": 0, "is_comment_start_trigger": 0, "is_comment_end_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_start_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_end_trigger": 0}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_15", "text": "I'm excited that this is moving forward.

I also want to thank the Renters Commission, who offered really valuable insight and feedback on this when it was taken to them for their input. Basically, what this ordinance does is amend the housing code within the city  to require residential rental units to have a carbon monoxide detector. It's currently not part of existing rental units. So the state does require, if you are building a new rental unit, that you do have to have carbon monoxide detectors. But as we know, there are a lot of existing.  much older units here in Ann Arbor for which that does not apply. So this would, very similar to what is required for smoke detectors in Ann Arbor, it's another level of safety and security for residents here. The one thing that I did want to point out to my colleagues is that we received later this afternoon a substitute amendment.  The change in this, just so that you know, is that it was pointed out that some boilers and furnaces and multifamily dwellings, so three or more apartments have heating systems that are not contained within the dwelling specifically. And so under the initial version of this ordinance, those units would have been exempt from having CO2 detection because they do not have fuel-fired appliances within the unit. So this covers that gap to make sure that it is inclusive of all different types of rental housing in the city requiring carbon monoxide detection units.  The other thing that is really important, I think, to point out here is that the  The maintenance and the ongoing assurance of safety within these CO detectors is the landlord's responsibility or the building owner's responsibility.

As we all know, civic flags, municipal flags, can be an incredibly important part of and component of civic pride. We also know that that really isn't the case here in Ann Arbor, in part, I believe, because the design of the current city flag does not meet proper vexillological principles.  That is to say, simplicity of design, use of symbolism that is meaningful, two or three basic colors, no lettering or seals, and distinctiveness, or relatedness if it's appropriate in the context. Municipal flags can be an important part of community cohesion, building enthusiasm for the municipality,  infusing civic pride, and it's something that I'm excited that we'll have the opportunity, perhaps, to bring forward in connection with the city's bicentennial in 2024. For folks that have seen the reference in the agenda, and with respect to the resolution, I'd encourage folks to check out the Good Flag, Bad Flag  flyer and folks who are interested in, since I have the floor, talking about one of my favorite podcasts, 99% Invisible, which Roman Mars talks a fair bit in the TED Talk and in a particular episode about the importance of city flags, their principles, their design, and their opportunities.

They've done and had great success over the course of years with having community design projects for public art that has been important to the fabric of the community.

You know, when I stood here and spoke with you a couple of weeks ago, I did so as the vice chair. What a difference a couple of weeks makes. I am now the chair of IPOC. And so it is good to greet you in that  position. Just by way of introduction, since you probably don't know me, I have been practicing law here in Washtenaw County for over 45 years. I initially started with the county prosecutor's office. So I worked with a lot of police officers every day. From there, I came here to the city attorney's office. I was an assistant city attorney and then first assistant city attorney. And as such, I represented police officers.  When I retired from the city, which I think was 97 or 98, I went into private practice, and in that position, I sued police officers. I grew up in the city of Detroit, and when I grew up in the city of Detroit, the police could probably rightly have been called terrorists. We were terrified of them. They had an organization, I don't know if you've heard of it, the Big Four, would ride through our communities  And they had guns sometimes sticking out of the back windows of the cars, and we would just run. So I think I have a pretty well-rounded view of policing. And I am happy to be here in this position today. So what is it then that you can expect? Probably nothing new. I'm standing on the shoes of some very capable previous chairs of this commission. But a couple of things that I'm looking at, and you may be hearing more about later,  One has to do with our complaint review, and as you know, that's one of the main things that we do, is review complaints. Some complaints come directly to ICPAC, some others come through the police department. We are hoping to get, and we're backlogged,  We have not had an opportunity to review all the complaints. And I'm going to tell you exactly what we need because I don't, I get this from folks who work with it, but we are hoping to get the creation of a spreadsheet and a webpage. And as I understand it, this will allow us to post things that we are, our progress so that the community can know what we're doing.  and communicate between the information managers. And the vice chair now and I have a meeting, I believe, scheduled with the city administrator to see how we can move quickly with this project of getting our spreadsheet and everything up and running. So that's number one. The next thing we expect to do, you know, the police officers have business cards that they hand out if a citizen requests it.  Right now it identifies the officer and it's also information about victims' rights. We are hoping, and maybe it might have to be a double-folded card, we're hoping to add information about ICPCC. And so that if the citizen has a complaint or a compliment about a police officer, they can contact us. So that's something that we hope to get going. We are  Looking at, you know, the Bible says that the power of life and death is in the tongue. And I believe that to be true. And sometimes, you know, things are set in the initial confrontation between the officer and the citizen.  I hope to stress courtesy and kindness. And I think if we look at that first, a lot of things that can happen later and can escalate may possibly be averted. So hopefully we can build that into our training. And then finally,  You may be finally, not finally, that's all we're gonna do, but that's all I'm gonna tell you about tonight. You may have heard, you probably did hear about a study that was being conducted primarily through Eastern Michigan University with a grant that came down, sort of through IPOC. And it's my understanding, this is a study of traffic stops in the city of Ann Arbor.  And I wanted to give you a heads up, I think, I am informed that the results of that study will be coming down this week. We had hoped to see it before, but we have not been, we don't know anything about what it's going to, what the results are going to be. And so we do not, we're not promoting it, we're just letting you know. It's supposed to be presented to ICPOC and council  and the police department this week. So heads up that may be coming and maybe we'll want to talk about it more when that comes down. So thank you. Are there any questions? If so, I'm happy to answer them.

I don't have to tell you, you know it, I'm sure you do, that this city council does not work for the public. They work very carefully and very, very long time for those who contribute to their campaigns.  The mayor sitting here right now last year got $90,000 in campaign contributions. His buddies sitting here and giggling all the time, they got $30,000, $40,000 in campaign contributions. You can be sure those who gave them hundreds and thousands of dollars in campaign contributions are not gonna sit and watch as they do stuff to benefit us. They want stuff in return.  Now, I tell you they don't work for us and they work for the rich in this town because Gilman is scot-free, has paid very little for the contamination, massive contamination of our waters. I tell you they work for the rich and not for us when we know for 20 years they've been talking about  housing and shortage of housing, still we don't have affordable housing, yet the developers are fat and nice. I tell you they work for the rich and not for us because after I made a big stink about $15 minimum wage during the past election time,  and discussions. And after this Miss America here, Dharma, agreed that we need $15 minimum wage. They still haven't installed it in Ann Arbor. Workers in Ann Arbor don't have $15 minimum wage. So they don't work for us. They work for the rich. We know that. This is still a limping liberal democracy. We can kick them out.  This is still a limping liberal democracy. We can kick them out. I invite you to come and kick them out next election cycle. Their human rights record is even more atrocious. They've got a lady here who cares little, if any, for Palestinian human rights. She has even less understanding of human rights commission in Ann Arbor. She's sitting there and, you know, saying yes to Mr. Mayor.  Yesterday, Mohammad Khaled Salabi was murdered in Palestine. He was 26 years old and he had just graduated from medical school. Imagine if a medical student right here in Ann Arbor was murdered by the police.  Israelis are murdering Palestinians on a daily basis. Now it's Ramadan and the festivities brings people to Al-Aqsa Mosque. And they find every opportunity to torture people, stop their access to medical care, and shoot them dead.  All I've been asking this esteemed group here is to say that they are against military aid to Israel. Yet they don't have the decency to do that. Kick them out. This is still not a dictatorship.

With mass murder, that's how.  So that brings us to Ann Arbor City Council, which loves to pass resolutions on global stuff, like a global warming, like animal rights, like goldfish rights, like the rights of deer. Look at your mayor, a big loud mouth for white Ukrainians. But never, never will you see him stand up for Palestinian rights. He has no heart.  Ann Arbor City Council has thrown its weight against every resolution for Palestinian rights for almost 40 years, since January 1984. Has this city council and this mayor ever looked at Palestinians as human beings? Ever? You tell me. As if there are rules for when you get to speak up for Palestinian human rights.  And the rule is never ever. The city council members sure seem to act like the rule is never ever. But 90 campus resolutions have broken that gag rule. Those resolutions insist on Palestinian human rights.  Amnesty International says Israel is committing the crime of apartheid against the Palestinian people. Human Rights Watch says so, too. Black Lives Matter says so, too. South Africa says so, too. And what the hell do you say? Not a goddamn thing. While Israel butchers the Palestinian people, you can't even make eye contact.  Israel is apartheid's last stand. So why is Ann Arbor City Council helping Israel to reload? To reload? Israel is so drunk with American guns and money that one of its highest officials has just said there is no such thing as the Palestinian people. And you say nothing.  Malcolm X said, stop talking about the South, as long as you're South of the Canadian border, you're South. Well, guess what? When it comes to Palestinian rights, the Ann Arbor City Council is way South, South even of the Ku Klux Klan. Ann Arbor City Council, your racist ship is sinking fast.  And I say, fuck you.

I just wanted to talk today just some general thoughts of housing in our city. Kind of I was thinking about like I know there's a public hearing for the PUD and it just bums me out that we have to do all these  you know, one by one project things to get our badly needed housing in the city. And so I've also been hearing from a lot of people. I'm just getting more into urban planning and stuff like that and asking people what their favorite cities are that they visited and stuff like that. And the most common answer that I get is Paris.  believe it or not. And um...  I really don't have a lot of money. I don't travel. So I'm like, well, instead of me traveling to Paris and checking it out, what if we made Ann Arbor more like Paris? And so what we could do is maybe aim for one million Ann Arbor residents, which still would have a significantly lower density than Paris. We would need, I believe, like,  1.5 or 1.6 million people to have the same density of Paris. But we could have really lively neighborhoods with lots of... What I wanna see is a lot of bigger apartment buildings with first floor activated space and  I think we're seeing in the closed streets for the summer are really winning a lot of people over the benefits of having more tables outside at cafes and restaurants and more programming, games for kids and special events and stuff like that. That doesn't have to just be limited to downtown. There's other areas in the city. We could give families that  maybe don't want to, that live far out from downtown and don't want to bike ride all the way through to downtown or something if they have another kind of a track, activated area of the city closer to them. And it just brings more creativity, more different types of people, and  it will help the environment.

I am one of the co-leaders of Citizens for Mental Health and Public Safety. I urge you to allocate the city's revenue from the county mental health and public safety millage to the unarmed response program.  The appropriation for millage funds of about $2.8 million per year would be in addition to the American Rescue Plan Act funding of $3.5 million. I will give two of the many reasons this would be good policy. First, the expansion of unarmed response will be another step forward in improving the quality of life in Ann Arbor.  Everyone benefits from living in a community where all people feel that others care for them. In the words of Martin Luther King Jr., quote, our goal is to create a beloved community, end quote. A beloved community is especially important to those who live with a serious mental health issue, those in poverty, and those bearing the brunt of racial, ethnic discrimination.  Second, the use of the millage funds for unarmed response would increase the chances the millage will be renewed. Many, and perhaps most, people believe a millage labeled mental health and public safety on the ballot should be spent on mental health and public safety services. The pressing need for better services in these areas reinforces their view.  The millage will expire after 2025, if not renewed or replaced. The replacement will probably be on the ballot in 2024. Now is the time for city policymakers to demonstrate that future tax revenues would be used for mental health and public safety services.

The past couple of weeks, I'm working on the eviction crisis that was looming where we had about 100 families living in hotels in the county with funding that was going to end on April 2nd.  That was adverted, so thanks to the county and county commissioners for allocating additional funds for that. But the question still remains as to what will we be doing every six months, what we'll be doing when it gets cold again, how many families are at risk for homelessness in our county.  So I've asked County Commissioner Somerville and Senator Irwin's office to work on a convening. I'd like to see all municipalities in the county gather and talk about this, the schools. If you talk to any school social worker who works on McKinney-Vento, which is a requirement to cover transportation for homeless students, to participate in these conversations, we'd have a real sense of the urgency around how we need housing for children in our community.  Tomorrow at 7 p.m. There's a Planning Commission meeting and review of a parcel in Ward 2 that's up for review. It's the U of M Credit Union project that  It's a one-story building with a drive-thru next to another bank. It's a one-story building with a drive-thru. Community members are against this. I, myself, am against this. And our hopes is that community members will come and give public comments. This city is hiring for summer activities. And we've heard from a number of families who are struggling for summer child care, day care. Thankfully, the city pays over $15 an hour to our employees. And there are a number of job openings on our website.  And then finally, I wanted to, oh, one other thing. On April 14, Washington Housing Alliance and the League of, what's it, LSSC, Legal Services of South Central Michigan is hosting an event, the Eviction Process and Tenant Rights event at 1.30.

I just want to talk a little bit about substance use disease. In reference to opioid use and substance use disorder, it's important for folks to understand that the language to use when relating to addiction is important. Words matter, and choosing the right language helps to decrease stigma and provide compassionate support for persons with substance use disorders and their families and the communities that support them.  Choosing the right language leads to more effective treatment and encourages persons with a substance use disorder to get the help they need, that they so need and deserve.  Michigan's opioid epidemic is complex. Understanding it requires multiple intricate and interconnected factors that have produced health inequities and made entire communities susceptible to adverse health outcomes. Reducing disparities must be a focus of programs funded with the opioid settlement funds.  Investing in evidence-based prevention, interventions, recovery supports, harm reduction efforts, and implementing criminal legal reforms to transition to a less punitive and more health-focused approach will all be key.  I am calling on the City of Ann Arbor and the surrounding communities to be a leader in reducing stigma. Promoting recovery from this disease by treating all people that suffer with a substance use disorder with dignity and respect.

My name is Carrie Nieto. I am a member of  1650 Kelvin Street. I have been there for four years. My neighbors have been there for almost 40 years. That area was a farmland many, many years ago. We love that area. We love our neighborhood. We are actually zoned Silo Township right now.  I guess one concern I have with rezoning skyscrapers in that area with no tenant parking allocated, currently there is a development being placed towards that roundabout by M14. I'm concerned with the access to those because currently there's zero access to that plot that butts up right up to M14.  except 1650 Calvin Street Road. So it'd be interesting to see what sort of traffic plans have been laid out for, I don't know how many units are going in there, hundreds? Where are they going to park? Do people expect them to park in other people's property? I think there's some major things that I would like to see. In addition to parking,  I don't know if anybody's been on that road on Maple Street, kind of heading towards M14. It's backed up almost to Jackson Road already. So we have one lane going each way.

My name is Jeff Wilkerson, and I am the developer and managing partner for the North Maple Apartment Project. I'm also the founder of A2 Collaborative, a local design development firm that is focused on innovative, forward-reaching housing solutions that incorporate various elements of sustainability, affordability, and community connectivity.  I wanted to take this opportunity to discuss the proposed PUD rezoning specific to the project and why I feel that this zoning is appropriate. The current site includes four large parcels that were previously classified as Township and R1B. Combined, these parcels total 3.13 acres, yet the current zoning only provides for three residential housing units. In consideration of the location along a major transit corridor,  in proximity to parks and community amenities, with ample access to public utilities, this is a vastly underutilized resource. The PUD zoning proposal for tonight allows the site to be utilized in a far more efficient way. Most importantly, the new zoning would allow for the addition of 79 critically needed new housing units, of which 12 of those would be allocated as affordable and provided on-site.  The building and clubhouse design maintains a modest footprint and preserves natural site features and open space. Orientation to Maple Road allows for efficient connectivity to public utilities, as well as access to public transportation. Setback proposals and landscape buffers will minimize disruption to current residents, both during and after construction. In fact, the location of the site itself offers a substantial buffer for current Ann Arbor residents.  In order to meet the future needs of the community, it is critical that we support a diversity of housing opportunities that bolster the economic and social well-being of the current and future residents. This PUD rezoning meets the sustainability objectives of the city while preserving and enhancing access to local resources that ultimately benefit all members of the Ann Arbor community.

No parking, I think it has 65 spaces.  There was a mention of hundreds of units. It's 79 units, actually. And a few things that I really like about this development are, I like the idea of the developer putting in a bus stop out in front and a crosswalk. I think that's sorely needed in that location, having another crosswalk there.  And I like that it's fully electrified, which I know we've had a lot of discussions around that as a city.

I would like to compliment the development team on this project. I've been following this since the initial pre-PUD meeting. What this developer has done is something we'd like all developers to do. They studied what the city wants, what the community has said it wants in terms of sustainability,  affordable housing, and they designed it from the start to meet what our city says it wants. They're not looking to get around the rules like some other developments do. They designed this very intentionally to meet what they studied and learned was what the city of Ann Arbor would like to see. So they deserve to be complimented.  For those who don't know, I used to develop subdivisions in Oakland County. This is what we would do. We would go to a community before we even had the land where we intended to develop. And we learned what that community would want. And we brought in proposals to meet those needs as opposed to other developers that decide what they want and try to get a city or community to bend to their will. So I really want to let council know  that you do, people are watching. Developers are watching your council meetings. You are sending a message with every vote you make. In the case of this developer, they've listened well to what our community has said at once.

I'd just like to take the next few minutes to highlight some of the major sustainability and design features of the site plan. First among those is a full commitment to all electrification. North Maple apartments will be all electric from day one and will include all electric Energy Star appliances as well as an all electric HVAC system.  Reduced on-site energy usage is key to producing low-carbon impact buildings, and early design decisions must commit to minimizing energy demand. The North Maple Apartments wall and window sections were designed to exceed current Michigan building code and include a continuous, unbroken insulation layer to minimize thermal bridging. Furthermore, the building's triple-pane windows underwent extensive performance analysis to ensure maximum effectiveness in air infiltration,  water penetration, and structural wind load testing. The incorporation of photovoltaic technology will allow for the onsite production of 147 megawatts of electricity annually via a 112 kilowatt rooftop solar array. Our energy modeling projects that these panels should offset as much as 15% of the building's anticipated annual energy usage.  The geothermal design for the project has undergone engineering review, and in coordination with an optimized thermal envelope, would make use of 19 500-foot borings located primarily in the courtyard that would provide all of the required heating and cooling needs for the building on an annual basis. The system would be zoned such that it would, in the event of one of these zones being disabled for maintenance or any other reason,  the entirety of the system could still effectively deliver heating and cooling aids to the building's residents. The North Maple site plan was also designed to promote non-vehicular usage, including the pedestrian crosswalk on North Maple that connects directly to Garden Homes Park, and a newly proposed sidewalk on the west side of Maple would fill a much needed gap between Maple Cove and the M14 interchange.  On-site amenities allow for ease of bike storage and maintenance for future residents, as well as public transportation infrastructure via a covered bus stop. We are proud of the design and sustainability elements included in this project, and it's my hope that council will offer its support for this project.

There's a lot in this. It was a very meaty resolution. One thing I wanted to comment on in particular was the first resolved clause that calls on the Michigan Public Services Commission to pass legislation to eliminate or lift the 1% distributed generation cap to increase energy reliability and capacity. Why is this important?  Well, according to a March 3rd report in the Detroit News, DTE Energy is predicting that they're going to reach this 1% milestone this July. And that means that they're going to be able to cut the rate that they pay for home solar that goes back into the grid to customers who have installed the panels. They're allowed to do this. They're allowed to cap their participation in distributed generation. And that amount is 1% right now of average peak load.  The impact that this has, it makes it harder for people to pay off their home solar system. It hurts businesses that are doing solar installation. All of the things that we want to encourage, it basically disincentivizes. Ironically enough, DTE's filing on this matter came six days before the ice storm that knocked out power to hundreds of thousands of DTE customers. Something that, by the way, residents that had solar with a battery backup were actually able to bear.  And so what they're basically proposing right now, they pay between $0.09 and $0.15 per kilowatt hour when you give energy back into the grid. And they're proposing that once this limit is reached, they pay $0.03 to $0.04 per kilowatt hour. So in other words, a quarter of what they are paying right now. The 1% number is arbitrary, it goes against our goals, and it needs to go away. So let's see a fair system for paying folks for the excess energy that they are generating.

I'm happy to be bringing this resolution forward from the Environmental Commission, and I wanted to say a few words about why supporting pollinator habitat is so important. Bees and other pollinators touch our lives every day in ways that we probably don't realize or we take for granted. For example, they're responsible for as much as a third of the food that we consume. So a world without them is one in which we have fewer food choices, and the ones that we have have less nutrition.  Pollinator populations are in decline around the world due to habitat loss, alteration, fragmentation, as well as pesticides. The state of Michigan alone has seen a 61% drop in its bee population over the span of 15 years. So this is really important that we all act in ways that we can to protect pollinators.  The Environmental Commission passed this resolution at their last meeting, which was just, I think, a week ago. This is an evolution of something that I think probably everyone remembers from last year, which was No Mo May, that they passed for 2022. I know that a lot of my neighbors participated in this and got excited about it. It allowed emergence and maturation of pollinators that overwinter in our yards.  We did learn some things from that effort namely that depending on the rain We probably don't need to literally stop mowing our lawn for the entire month There were some quite quite long lawns out there But also, you know, we learned that there was a lot of resident interest and so the Environmental Commission was looking at this and trying to think of a way to  you know, a monoculture of turf grass that's really long isn't ultimately what we're going for. It's a start. But I think concentrating on what we can do year-round and the practices that will actually create habitats that are amenable to pollinators was really the focus of what you see in front of you. So encouraging residents to reduce mowing, especially in the spring, reducing leaf cleanup, as well as, you know, having diverse native plantings.  So in other words, consider alternatives to turf grass. So you'll notice that this resolution talks about a communication plan. I think the Environmental Commission is eager to work with staff on different seasonal campaigns, such as a spring, emphasizing the mowing frequency. I did want to note that everything that is in here complies with our current ordinances. So there's nothing that has to be an exception. I think the limit is 12 inches for grass.

So that's nice diversity within the project.  As for sustainability, we've heard a lot about that. But I will just assure you that the PUD regulations stipulate. So this is what the zoning calls for. And even if this project were not to happen for some reason, which I have no reason to think that it would not, this is what this parcel will be zoned for.  It stipulates the development will be all electric, equipped with solar panels and batteries to offset 15% of its annual energy use. It will be insulated above building code requirements to minimize heat loss and maximize the panel's effectiveness. The developer described the design of the geothermal heating. That was nice. It will also be equipped with high efficiency LED lighting, Energy Star appliances, and operable triple pane windows, which is great.  The project supports alternative transportation, as we've spoken. There will be 65 parking spaces off street for 79 units.

We, meaning City Council, back in 2017, Avalon was able to get tax credits from MSHDA in 2018. And only just last year, we had a groundbreaking for the second phase of the development project, right?

And now we have a project in front of us that not only helps us maybe tighten that timeline a little bit, but add to our much needed housing stock for a community at 60% AMI.

It meets needs along a transit corridor so that we won't be contributing to more traffic, more commuter traffic. And it's nearby a high school, a popular high school.

Her work will be guiding our work and our mission for a long time to come.  Just a few things that she did for us. First of all, she brought wisdom and experience that was needed to launch ICPAC. She led in the establishment of our budget. She formulated interview questions for candidates. She developed the training requirements for the commissioners. And she hosted many of our meetings and training  sessions. And I know you've probably read about her and you know what she meant to the community at large, but she meant these things to ICPAC. But you know, I spoke to some of the commissioners and other people that worked closely with Jude. The one thing that everyone said about her was how kind she was. Her kindness was evident to everyone who knew her.  and that kindness will be remembered. She was kind in her personal life, and she was kind in her professional life. We just don't understand how such a terrible thing could happen, but everyone who came in contact with Jude spoke of her kindness. Ralph Waldo Emerson said, you cannot do kindness too soon, for you never know  how soon it will be too late. And I think about that when we think about Jude. And I just want to suggest that perhaps as we move into our moment of silence, that in her honor and in her remembrance, we commit to being a little kinder to each other every day.

They are central to the defense and propagation of the city.  That's probably a word somewhere in there, and I'm sure someone will find one. Propagation of democracy, both here in Ann Arbor, that's protection throughout our various communities. Here in Ann Arbor, we are incredibly grateful to have a city clerk and a clerk's office that does outstanding work, that promotes elections, that promotes voting, that enables everyone in our community who wishes to vote and is allowed to vote to be able to vote.

One, of course, one often thinks of wages and other working conditions and benefits when it comes to the benefits of organized labor. But worker safety is among the core benefits. And the promotion of worker safety is among the core benefits of an organized workforce.

And I am just delighted that we are able here to recognize the work that  that is ongoing to continue to promote worker safety in the United States. Whereas every year, April 28, communities and work sites around the world honor friends, family members, and colleagues who have been killed or injured on the job. Whereas in 2021, the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics estimated that 5,190 workers were killed by traumatic injuries on the job, an average of nearly 100 workers every week.  Whereas in 2021, 140 workers were lost through fatal workplace accidents here in Michigan. And whereas it is appropriate to honor the memory of the courageous and dedicated members of Ann Arbor's labor force who have been injured or disabled or have died as a result of workplace accidents.

They never see their families again.  and it's something that is a true loss and it's something that local government can play a role in combating by prioritizing safety measures and contractors that invest in education and training that you can have a highly skilled workforce that is able to confidently do the job well and safely and be able to ensure that the whole community can rest assured that people  can do the job well and make sure that no one ever has to experience the loss that some of these folks have had to endure.

Thank you.", "start": 1183.743, "end": 1259.063, "Transition": "\"\"", "Meeting Section": "Other", "Speaker Role": "Other", "is_public_comment": 0, "is_public_hearing": 0, "is_comment_start_trigger": 0, "is_comment_end_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_start_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_end_trigger": 0}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_33", "text": "This is the one day a year that I get to stand and actually face you. This is wonderful. Mayor, members of council, it's my pleasure to stand before you this evening to present the city administrator's proposed budget for fiscal year 24 and 25.  Each year, we have to be intentional about what we're trying to accomplish with the budget. For this year, that is positioning for long term impact. The budget's purpose is not only to clarify how we propose to invest the public dollars that we are entrusted to manage.  But it is also necessary for us to be transparent about the direction that we believe we should take. I'm going to do a presentation for you this evening that touches on both things. Some notion of how we propose to invest public dollars, but also to talk about directions that we believe we should take.  You have your budget books. You have my detailed budget message. Therefore, I will not stand here and read numbers back to you. I'll use numbers here and there just for context purposes. But the full details of all the budget is there before you. So we are presenting a proposed budget, all funds of $563 million, $666,000.  The general fund, which is the bread and butter that makes up the services that many of our residents come to expect, is just shy of $130 million. The general fund has experienced 6.4% growth. State shared revenue is essentially flat at 1%. And our pension system is still among the gold standard in the United States.  If you understand pension systems within that industry, if you are 70% funded, that is considered very good. For us to be at 90% is extraordinary. And so we're positive about having that. At the same time, we see pressure melting. From a fiscal standpoint, we are charged with being conservative.  So when we look at the fact that the economists are still forecasting a potential recession in the calendar year, when we look at the fact that state shared revenue is flat, that our marijuana excise tax receipts have essentially leveled off when we thought they would continue to rise.  even though we have solid growth in the general fund, those other factors are there and it's our responsibility to take note of it with you. It's not about doomsday, it's not about the sky is falling, we're not here saying the world is going to end, but we are alerting you that we see conditions in the future, that we see conditions in the future worth noting.  Within two to four years, our recurring expenses will eclipse our recurring revenues. We need to pay attention to that. We pivot now to celebrating Ann Arbor. What you see on the screen is the logo that has been designed to recognize our bicentennial.  As you know, I'm one of the people leading the community wide effort to prepare for the celebration for next year. Dr. Missy Stoltz is heading up the internal city government preparation for the bicentennial celebration. Our plan is to celebrate across 12 full months, not one month, not one week, not one day, but all 12 months. One of the things that we are proposing to do  is to invest $200,000 in this year and next year's fiscal year budget in order to support the efforts of the Bicentennial activities. It would help to cover the activities that city government is doing, such as a planned salute for former Olympians who are from Ann Arbor, an idea that was presented to us by an Olympian.  Also would allow us to partner with Destination Ann Arbor to procure a photographer and a videographer who would capture the essence of what happens across the 12 months. This is a milestone within the city's history. We should capture it and we need to preserve what we do for going forward.  In addition to the $200,000 per year that we're proposing to allocate, there will also be additional leveraging that takes place through what we call co-branding. Co-branding are activities that you were already going to do. But in 2024, you will simply do it under a bicentennial banner.  And so by leveraging activities that we already have planned, that will add another several hundred thousand dollars to the city's investment in Bicentennial. We are also encouraging other organizations across the city to do likewise. As an example, this coming summer, the Art Fair is planning on beginning to co-brand their activity.  so that their artists will have a year's notice that next year is the Bicentennial, which might influence some of the products, some of the artwork that they bring here to sell. One of the legacy projects that we would like to do is to create Bicentennial Park. We propose to take what is currently Fuller Park  rename it to Bicentennial Park, and place a number of new amenities within the park. This will not be accomplished in a single year. It will require investments from city government, but there are also opportunities for sponsorships in order to make this vision come to reality. Fuller Park, by the way,  is not dedicated to an individual, so we're not taking a name away from someone. Fuller Street is dedicated to an individual, but Fuller Park is not. So the legacy project would include, I guess we gotta go back to glasses. We wanna do a universal access splash pad.  Geothermal systems to make the park carbon neutral. We propose to do a sculpture to former Olympians. We want to do a sculpture garden to pay tribute to indigenous land holders. We'd like to see sensory trails put in the park given the proximity to Children's Hospital. We'd like to erect a shelter building for parks programming. And we'd also like to add community garden plots.  again, can't happen in a single year, would require investments from city government, but also sponsorship opportunities for organizations that may want to put their name on something that we're doing. Still within the focus of celebrating Ann Arbor is our sister city of T\u00fcbingen, Germany. This summer we will be sending a delegation there to visit. They will host our delegation over several days.  The pictures that you see on the screen are from Tubagen. They are proposing to send a delegation here next year for six days. And we're allocating $30,000 in order to cover the activities of the delegation while they're here. They are trying to plan their trip to coincide with some of the events and activities that are taking place in  in honor of the celebration. So sometime during the summer months we probably will be entertaining their visit. We next pivot into supporting democracy. If you think back to the last election there were two narratives at play. The long lines that were experienced in Ann Arbor and across the country  And the second narrative around voter integrity, the protection of the ballots, the protection of the count. In order to address this, we are proposing to establish an election center. An election center will be an actual physical location. The election center will be managed by the office of the clerk.  It would give them space to process ballots. It would give them space to secure ballots. It would give them the opportunity to do all the things associated with ensuring we have a fair and proper election. Because our situation is one where we have to try to be efficient at all times, we want to be opportunistic around the opportunity that setting up the election center would give us.  Therefore, we are also proposing to co-locate CTN as part of the election center physical footprint. Today, CTN is in a leased space. We are proposing to move it into a city-owned facility. We're also proposing to create the city's first emergency operations center.  Historically when we've needed to have an ELC, graciously the University of Michigan has allowed us to use their facility. But we are a large enough city where we should have our own facility. If you think just about this current calendar year, there were three occurrences where we would have activated an ELC if we had one.  the visit by the Vice President, the ice storm, and the subsequent snowstorm. All of those would have merited the kind of attention that the ELC would bring. We would intend to pursue state and federal funding to equip and set up the ELC, not to use general fund dollars if at all possible. In order to establish  The election center, this will be a real estate transaction, very likely to be seven figures. In addition, it would cost us some 300,000 plus annually to operate the facility. So the image that you see on the screen is generic, because we don't yet have a facility to put a transaction in front of you. We are working on that.  And to address the long lines that we experienced on election day, the office of the clerk is proposing to have nine days of early voting. The clerk's office is working in partnership with the University of Michigan and others to set that up.  And one of the challenges that Ms. Boudreaux will face is how to convince young people to actually vote early instead of waiting to party in the line on election day. So good luck with that, Jackie. But we do want to do this to try to address the experience that we've had. We then pivot into sustainability.  July 1 will mark the beginning of our collection of the Community Climate Action Millage. $7 million is what we propose to collect.  and the staff under Dr. Stoltz's leadership will be working on expanding solar distribution, further weatherization of houses and neighborhoods, the expansion of EV charging stations around the community, continuing to study geothermal. She proposes, and what's in the budget,  is to add seven positions that will be funded by the millage in order to carry out this work. We then pivot into the neighborhoods. This is the first season when the road bond initiative is actually in full swing.  So the local streets you see on the screen, Olivia, Norfolk, Tudor, Winstead, Dunmore and more will be covered under this year's iteration of the road bond program. Additionally, we have major streets resurfacing that will also be covered by the bonds.  South State, South Main, Geddes, Earhart, Research Park Drive are all examples of major streets that will be resurfaced under this program. We acknowledge that as a community, we are going to go through major inconvenience. You cannot do accelerated street paving at the rate we are proposing to do it without inconvenience.  But our mindset is progressing through the inconvenience because on the back end, we will have a much better community. In addition to the two slides I've shown you, we also have local resurfacing that will happen. This does not use road bond funds, and that includes Aberdeen, Belfield, Avon Road, and Bedford Road.  Paving, paving, paving, a lot of that going on. But that is what we promised and that's what we hope to deliver. For the past several years, our community has struggled with stormwater management issues around the city. The picture at the top of the screen is a local picture of what people experience that deal with stormwater management.  This budget invests $250,000 to conduct drainage studies. Drainage studies across 13 miles to allow us to get a better handle on the cause and potential solutions for people who have been experiencing this situation. We owe it to the community to find a way to resolve this issue.  And these studies will enable us to do that. In addition, we are undertaking a solid waste program review. So, sort of rhetorically, what does better look like?  So when you look at waste collection and recycling, commercial composting, oversized materials collection, we are trying to find a way to deliver our service in a better way. We are trying to be a factor in helping our city to become cleaner. This is also an issue that has been raised relative to downtown Ann Arbor.  It is not solely the city's role to address this, but we do have a part to play. And by looking at our program service delivery to find better ways to do it, we hope to be a significant factor in showing the improvement. And now we turn to issues of public interest. First out of the gate is the Treeline Trail.  The Treeline is a long-term project. By all accounts, it will take more than a decade to actually build it out should we have that success. We are continuing our relationship with the Treeline Conservancy. We have placed an investment in the budget to hire consultative help to work with the Conservancy on the project.  However, the project has not yet matured to a point where it would warrant hiring a full-time FTE that would work all day every day on nothing but treeline. When the project gets to that point, I would be supportive of the FTE, but it's not yet ripe.  Our staff is working with the Treeline Conservancy's own lobbyist and our lobbying firm to pursue state and federal resources to advance the project. Still on issues of public interest, the unarmed response.  Last year when the budget was passed and subsequent to that, City Council appropriated $3.5 million in ARPA funding to provide the seed money necessary to get the program set up. In last year's budget, we set aside out of the marijuana excise tax $250,000 to support the initial investment.  In this budget, we're proposing to take 250,000 this year and next year to continue to provide the necessary cushion for that program to have a very solid beginning and operating. We need to actually see 12 full months of the program working to determine what it actually costs to do a single year.  And once I see how much it costs to do a year, then that would inform whether we bump that number up or look for another source. There's probably grant dollars out there that we can also pursue. And since we are aggressive about grants in Ann Arbor, it is something we would certainly look at. Which then brings us to 121 East Catherine Street. Still within the focus of issues of public interest.  On the screen, you see the rendering supplied by the Housing Commission. This is a Housing Commission project. But it's much more than just a building. 121 East Catherine is in an area of the city that historically was predominantly African American. And the vision for this project, aside from the 63 apartment units,  was to take 2,300 square feet of space on the first floor and turn it into a cultural and entrepreneurial center aimed at reclaiming our history. The only problem is there was no money to build out the space. So this budget takes $325,000 from the marijuana excise tax,  to design and build out the space, an additional 150 for capacity building for the neighborhood-based organization that is needed to influence and inform what happens there. It would be not in our best interest to construct a building, have 2,300 square feet of space on the ground floor, say it is there,  to connect with the people whose neighborhood it once was and have it be empty. So we want to address that as part of the construction. Finally, under issues of public interest, we need to have a solid workforce. Our workforce is too thin.  We have just north of 800 people. The needs and demands for service from the staff continues to grow. We have had a situation where several of our classifications are simply not market competitive.  Good employees have left here and gone to work for other municipal organizations because of money. There have been good candidates that we have tried to hire who have chosen not to come here because the salary is not competitive. We are investing $150,000 in this budget to conduct a compensation study. Our approach  in the past has been, I tend to just call it a series of one-offs. We find a problem over here and we go and try and fix it. We find an equity problem over there and we go and try and fix it. We need to have a global understanding of where are the specific positions that are not market competitive and what will it take to fix them.  Then we can devise a strategy that actually moves the needle. And that is what we are proposing to do with the 150 investment. This budget is adding 27 positions total. Those are detailed in your budget dictionary. But the majority of them are not gonna be funded out of the general fund.  Seven coming out of the millage. There are nine positions for the housing commission. HR is getting a deputy director. There's a few sprinkled here and there. And then we pivot to improving the customer experience, which is broader than just customer service. I've talked to you before about our need to elevate our customer service across the organization.  We have great examples of customer service every single day within the organization. Our issue is that we are not always consistent in how that service delivery happens. This budget invests $50,000 to help us get a consultant to develop customer service standards, develop training that we can use for staff to help us be a better organization across the board.  That's one element of the customer experience. The customer experience also includes the 15th District Court. They have a courtroom recording system that is clearly on the way out. I had a conversation with the chief judge. She told me that the company that they bought the system from no longer exists.  When they need to get parts to try to repair the system, they literally have to go on eBay to try to find them. That's why I put that on the screen. We can do better. So this budget invests $260,000 to replace that system.  The significance of the courtroom recording system, they have a requirement to produce transcripts from every single court proceeding. If the recording system fails, they can't do that. It's not a position that we can afford to be in. And then that brings us to supportive connections. A program that you created with the last budget.  One of the overarching goals of the program is to help people stay out of the judicial system. Yet we ask them to come into the Justice Center in order to access the services for a provision that we're trying to keep them out of. And if you look at the picture on the right, you see that the experience that someone has going into the office  where they may be needing to impart very sensitive personal information is really not conducive. Between the boxes and the cramped space, it's simply not up to par. So with this budget, we are proposing to take a portion of the one-time opioid settlement money, do a construction project,  in the former Tasty Green restaurant space and moved supportive connections from the fourth floor of the Justice Center into the first floor of City Hall. I wasn't around for Tasty Green. I heard it wasn't, well, we'll keep moving.", "start": 1302.677, "end": 2933.699, "Transition": "\"\"", "Meeting Section": "Other", "Speaker Role": "Other", "is_public_comment": 0, "is_public_hearing": 0, "is_comment_start_trigger": 0, "is_comment_end_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_start_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_end_trigger": 0}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_25", "text": "We'll keep moving.", "start": 2933.699, "end": 2937.881, "Transition": "\"\"", "Meeting Section": "Other", "Speaker Role": "Other", "is_public_comment": 0, "is_public_hearing": 0, "is_comment_start_trigger": 0, "is_comment_end_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_start_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_end_trigger": 0}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_33", "text": "And then that brings us to Council Chambers.

The lighting, we want to put a mural in the ceiling. We want to have a standardization of the dais, things today we do not have.  It is part of the customer experience. And when you think back to where I started, this budget is intentional about positioning for long-term impact. This is a long-term decision that we are proposing to do now. Which then brings us to the downtown commitment. This has been something I've been championing my entire time here.  We've been engaging with stakeholders. We've been listening. We've been working with them. The number one thing that they said through our sessions and through surveys is we need to address the issue of public restrooms. And so I formed a public restroom work group", "start": 2937.881, "end": 3025.597, "Transition": "\"\"", "Meeting Section": "Other", "Speaker Role": "Other", "is_public_comment": 0, "is_public_hearing": 0, "is_comment_start_trigger": 0, "is_comment_end_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_start_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_end_trigger": 0}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_32", "text": "I gotta say, Mr. Barrett, when I told my granddaughter I was doing that, she thought I was kidding.", "start": 3029.556, "end": 3035.525, "Transition": "\"\"", "Meeting Section": "Other", "Speaker Role": "Other", "is_public_comment": 0, "is_public_hearing": 0, "is_comment_start_trigger": 0, "is_comment_end_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_start_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_end_trigger": 0}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_33", "text": "Gran, what kind of job do you really have? So we've had people from various city departments, DDA, Destination Ann Arbor,  We've been meeting for months. We've been talking with elected officials. We've been talking with appointed officials. We've been studying restroom models. We've been looking at restrooms across the United States. We've been looking at restrooms overseas. Our one mandate is that any restroom that goes in downtown Ann Arbor must be ADA accessible. And so as a result of that work,  we have settled on the throne as the model that most fits Ann Arbor. It wouldn't look like what you see in the screen because you can change the exterior skin, but we found a company out of DC that has created an all ADA accessible model. We want to use the $200,000 that's already been allocated from ARPA  to do a pilot to make sure that the unit does what they say it will do. In doing this project, you've got to look at the infrastructure needs, you've got to look at the amount of space you need on your right of way, access to electricity, the cleaning function, the whole nine yards.  As we got deeper into the project, we found that there are other institutions or organizations within the city that also have that need. AAATA as an example. Where do bus drivers go when they need to stop? Because a lot of the private sector businesses do not want people to use their restrooms unless they're actually patrons. So the DDA is gonna be leading a placement analysis to help figure out where these should go.  More to come, the throne, who knew? Still within the downtown commitment, there has been concern expressed about safety. And this is an area where I'm talking to you about direction rather than dollars that I'm proposing to allocate right now. Last holiday season,  We put a walking unit in downtown and in Briarwood to go and engage with business owners, to engage with patrons, to engage with anyone that they saw. In Ann Arbor, we need to use a balanced solution, which means not a police-only solution. The direction that I would like to go in  is to establish a walking unit that would have fire EMTs, supportive connections person, and members of AAPD. They would walk together. They would walk together to build relationships, to address issues, to provide resource information for those who need it, to address people who may be having some minor  health or injury related situation. It will take us some time to get there because we don't have a full complement within the police department. The fire department will need to add two positions in order to do this and we need to figure out the capacity of supportive connections to be able to do it. But we're being completely transparent about the direction that we want to take.  That then brings us back to the solid waste study that we want to do, because there is a definite link between clean and safe. And so if we can help get downtown cleaner, we can help with the presence of the walking unit. We can provide public restrooms. Now we are talking about solutions that mean something and bring results. Won't get there overnight, but this is the direction that we want to head.  Which brings me to a case for revenue and the final section for me to present to you. From the graph, you see that we have more needs and resources. We are not unlike any other city. Our concern is what can Ann Arbor do about it? We have needs for housing at all levels. We have deferred maintenance.  that we've been putting off, and the longer you defer it, the more expensive it gets. And we have capacity issues within the staff. We need revenue. If state shared revenue is flat, if the marijuana excise tax receipts have leveled off, the growth in the general fund is simply not sufficient to address everything that we need.  I'll say this clearly. I am not talking about a tax hike. I'll say it again. I am not talking about a tax hike. I am talking about being more strategic with the assets that we have. Here are two examples. I would like to pursue  the building of a market rate development on the promenade that you're looking at. A market rate development would generate revenue back to the city. We could put a development there and walk our own talk. It could be all electric. It could be a model  for the kind of development we are challenging the community to come up with. You would simply capture the revenue from that development and then reimagine City Hall. We are never going back to a time when this building is full.  If we tried, employees would just quit. People aren't going to work where they have to show up every day if they have a choice. And we want our organization to be the employer of choice. So by capturing the revenue from that development and reimagining this building, who knows where that could lead us. I also  want to pursue taking what we call the Klein lot, which was assessed at $19 million some years ago, and I would like to see us pursue putting a market rate development on it. Because then you could capture the revenue that spins off from the development  Use it for deferred maintenance for staff support For service delivery that the public is demanding that we give them that we struggle to do now admittedly The use of the Klein lot for market rate versus affordable May get me uninvited to a Thanksgiving dinner table but  The spot that we are in, we simply, in my professional opinion, which is what you want me to give you, we cannot afford to take all of our assets and do all these development deals with private sector and others where the city gets no money. The developers need something. They want something. And if we're deferring all of our return for 30 years, but we're cash poor now,  The way I was trained, that does not work. Things to think about, nothing for you to vote on, just direction. My surprise for the evening, there's $1 million in marijuana excise tax that I did not allocate. It's in the fund balance for your consideration. As your advisor, you don't have to spend it all.  But I do have an obligation to tell you that I left it. Positioning for long term impact. I want to thank the finance department, the staff in the city administrator's office, the men and women who comprise the service areas of the organization. And I want to thank you for giving me the opportunity to serve as your city administrator. And on May 15th when you vote,  You don't really have to change a thing, just vote yes.

Hello, this is Ralph McKee. Good evening, Fifth Ward. My first topic is CA-13.  which would authorize paying the Bodmin Law Firm another $150,000 to pursue litigation against Gelman. Since 2016, Bodmin has been paid $900,000 to fight Gelman, and in-house lawyers have spent countless hours. That has accomplished virtually nothing. And pursuit of state litigation also unfortunately resulted in delaying asking for EPA intervention by almost five years. Approving more fees is throwing good money after bad.  State law currently has no teeth. Further, pages 8 to 11 of the 2006 settlement agreement between the city and Gilman, negotiated by Bodmin, bars many types of claims that we might have, and they might be time-barred, too. You should be getting a second opinion. It's not appropriate to have Bodmin be the only one, since they'll benefit from going forward by getting paid, even if they lose.  And they did a bad job of telling you in the public about the infamous fourth CJ and the subsequent corporate process. Do you have a detailed memo explaining why these claims aren't barred? The agenda description does say part of the litigation will be enforcing the 2006 settlement agreement, that same agreement I just talked about. That's allowed under that agreement. Why couldn't that be done mainly in-house with minimal supervision from Bodmin? It seems a relatively discreet contractual matter rather than a complex environmental case.  Overall, this is a terrible waste of money, which Mr. DeHoney just said we need pretty bad. Next topic is the AC1 memo for a food truck at the comments. There are several positions in it which omit important facts or misleading or just wrong. Many of these are detailed in Julie Ritter's email to you yesterday, all of which I agree with. I'll focus on just a couple. The memo emphasizes the loss of parking revenue.  However, it seems that there isn't any lost revenue if there would be empty spaces in the underground lots during food truck events, and there typically are. Next, why couldn't the food trucks be charged the same amount for the space they take up? Next, under a 2019 resolution, parking revenue was actually supposed to be used to financially support the commons. That's been ignored, and the use of phantom loss of revenue as a reason not to allow activity on the commons is insulting, really, particularly when the 2018 Charter Amendment approved  was supposed to make this a commons. Obviously, that charter amendment is inconsistent with having cars park there permanently. This strange implicit argument in the memo would block any use other than parking. Finally, the statement that you need to get a detailed legal opinion rate commercial activity is not an indicator of the author's bias against the commons. Really, we've never had vendors allowed to get a permit on city property to sell things? Don't we have a street art fair?  My band is scheduled to play at the Commons this Saturday. Does that violate the charter? Should I worry about putting out a tip jar? It's facetious, partially, but really, do you think that the Prop A proponents, who by and large are the same people who want food trucks, are going to sue the city? This memo looks like it's the latest attempt to stall, stymie, and any activity and kill the Commons. It's shameful.

I want to address several topics tonight, but before that, I'd just like to thank Administrator DeHoney for his fantastic budget presentation. First, I want to make a quick note on the comprehensive plan CA-14, if I remember correctly.  I'm glad to see progress happening on this. Given how many of the PUD requests we see in the Planning Commission recently have been for things that, frankly, should be allowed in the zoning already, the comprehensive plan should make a clear call for liberalizing our zoning so that we don't have all of this unnecessary process and require things to be PUDs. Let's fix that.  Right now, a lot of Ann Arbor landmarks would just be illegal to build. So we should change that so that we can build the next generation of landmarks. Second, about the Dioxin, it's clear to even the lay observer that the company who purchased Gelman Sciences is using every bit of procedural trickery available to distance themselves from this mess. So this is ludicrous.  So far, the city has taken only tentative and timid actions about this. But given that the health of everyone in the city is on the line here, it's time to be bold. Finally, the memorandum to council about food trucks at the library department. In short, it was flawed reading this. If I understand correctly, the Council of the Commons contains several members who were involved in the drafting of Proposal A.  Yet the first meaningful attempt that they've made to activate the space is legally questionable under the language of that very proposal. Add to this the fact that it comes over four years after Proposal A was voted on, and the whole center of the city claims starts to look like, honestly, a bit of a damp squib.  So I went back and watched a few Council of the Commons meetings, and I must say the experience has left me baffled as to how we have continued this for so long. What a brooding, nagging squandering of the city's limited resources. At a recent meeting, the two council liaisons rightly  who removed themselves from the call in protest of a massive breach of rules of order designed to prevent a single commissioner from monopolizing the commission's time. Unfortunately, that appears to have been the only consequence for this commission, despite numerous other breaches of civility and etiquette. So maybe it's time to rethink proposal A altogether.

Dan Adams, 1016 Daniel Street. The Council of Commons was created in 2020 to advise this body and help plan the creation of a public park on the library lot. What it's become is a dysfunctional, deeply divided body that's neither advising you nor effectively advancing that project.  The latest example of this is on your agenda tonight. That's a nine-page memo prepared by the city administrator, requested by the Council of the Commons on the viability of permitting food trucks on the library lot. Asking city staff to analyze whether food trucks are viable on the site is, to be clear, a desperation play.  It's the best option among bad options to activate a site that everyone understands to be undesirable. This is something they proposed back in 2021, and to quote one member, they just needed a win. The logic of using food trucks to draw people to gather on an unimproved parking lot has it exactly backwards, and there are a lot of reasons for that.  But it also won't work. A 10-year-old Parks Advisory Commission report explained to us, again, 10 years ago, why. The site doesn't have foot traffic. It's boxed in on three sides. And it needs infrastructure to function properly as a public space. Council Member Briggs, you will recall asking the library director at the Council of the Commons meeting in December about food trucks and activating that site with that activity. And he responded that they've had food trucks on that site.  And they're not profitable. So this isn't a hypothetical. We've tested this. The libraries put food trucks out there. They've had to subsidize that activity. And that's the conclusion reached by the administrator. But the dysfunction of this body goes deeper than that. The last Council of the Commons meeting, the members were discussing a draft design RFP that isn't ready to issue despite two solid years of planning. It's badly overdue. It hasn't been socialized with city park staff. And it was attacked most of the meeting by a member of the council.  who spent an eight-plus-minute diatribe attacking it that survived inexplicably multiple points of order by other members. This council has outlived its utility to the public, and unless it's given a deadline to wrap its work up, it's going to continue to flounder. It's going to bicker about the terms of this RFP that it's never going to issue, and then it's going to attempt to justify its own existence by making work for city staff.  pass a resolution suspending the work of this body effective June 1. Give them a month of runway to wrap up their work. Then let staff and council members who have been supporting this activity patiently focus more of their time on actually meeting pressing resident needs.

This is Tom Stolberg calling from Lower Town in Ann Arbor. I'm calling about CA-14, the resolution to authorize a professional services agreement with Interface Studio LLC for comprehensive plant services. I am looking forward to this process, as I'm sure many of you are, and as many people in the community are.  I speak from the perspective of someone who has been a real estate professional for over 30 years, including as a developer, and who is looking to the Comprehensive Plan and subsequent zoning changes for guidance on future development of properties that I, my investors, and my clients own. I participated in some previous Comprehensive Plan revision processes, such as the Northeast Area Plan, P2D2, and the Lowtown Comprehensive Plan, as well as observing Comprehensive Plan revisions that impacted properties that I developed in other communities.  I've written and spoken many times to city council regarding comprehensive plan issues and other zoning matters. It is my hope that through this process that we are about to embark on, that the public, city council and planning commission will all gain better understanding of how planning and zoning is supposed to work. We haven't done a great job over the past several years. This is not just my opinion, but the observation of multiple experts.  Our city council members and commissioners haven't received the training and professional guidance that they, and we as their constituents, deserve. This has led to a number of votes based on narratives and speeches rather than on the criteria laid out in our law. An attorney recently asked me what I want to see from our city. My response was that I wanted honesty, intellectual honesty, adherence to proper processes, respect for the law, both the letter and the intent of the law.  We have fallen short of a number of times over the past several years. We seem to prefer our narratives to establish processes, to adherence to the Michigan Zoning and Aging Act, and to adherence to our unified development code. Perhaps this extensive revision of the comprehensive plan will better educate us on how it should be done. I'd also like to mention a good article in the most recent observer regarding development issues and also PUDs.  Later tonight, I will speak regarding an application for a PUD that contains multiple misrepresentations, that doesn't comply with multiple federal and city policies, and that clearly violates the intent of the law, and that likely violates the letter of the law. Are PUDs good or bad or just a tool? It was several years ago that some planning commissioners and city council members and their supporters narrated was that PUDs weren't viable.  That narrative is tied to the inappropriate loss of $9 million in affordable housing funds and monetized lower town development, and a similar failed attempt at upzoning while avoiding obligatory affordable housing funds down the block from there occurring. I sincerely hope that the comprehensive plan revision process is a successful, eye-opening, and clarifying experience for us all.  process matters. I look forward to this comprehensive plan revision.

Last October, I addressed council about the Ann Arbor School's compliance with Public Act 170, which mandates teaching of the Holocaust.  Since then, the school board was kind enough to provide me the requested information. I addressed the board last week and hoped that we were molding Ann Arbor students to become independent thinkers. I addressed council tonight with the same concern. The textbook used in our schools is World History Patterns of Interaction.  In the section on the Holocaust, our student first reads, the Nazis proclaimed that the Germanic peoples were a, quote, master race, end quote. I think we're all accustomed to that phrase. But I note that there's no attribution to that quote, no reference. Which Nazi leader said those words? There's no way for the student to know.  If the student were equipped with books that challenged that claim, such as Benton Bradbury's The Myth of German Villainy, he could read that no Nazi ever said those words. And if the student were encouraged to do so, he could download a copy of Mein Kampf by Adolf Hitler and could scan for Master Race. He won't find it, and he may be puzzled by the claim.  He may even conclude that master race was merely wartime propaganda in which all sides took part. On the same page, our student reads that the beginning of the Holocaust targeted Jews due to German failures. Some Germans even blamed Jews for their country's defeat in World War I, as if nothing could be further from the truth. But Alice and Weir's book, Against Our Better Judgment,  documents clearly that during that war, when Germany was about to defeat Britain, and had actually offered a negotiated peace, Zionist Jews engaged in the process of getting the U.S. into the war on Britain's side.  Prominent American Jews like Louis Brandeis and Felix Frankfurter worked behind the scenes to accomplish this task and were in fact successful at getting the Americans into the war, which ensured Germany's defeat. So what is ridiculed in the text our student reads is actually the true historic accounting of events.  I encourage the board, as I do counsel tonight, to provide our student with enough information to make up his mind independently and critically about historical events, and that he be provided with an array of viewpoints, not just one.

I appreciate this opportunity to speak before you tonight to talk about the center of the city. It's now approaching five years since Proposal A was passed and the sad truth is that we have very little to show for it. The request for proposals is still being worked on. The space has still not been activated in any meaningful sense.  City staff's analysis of what it would take to activate the space with food trucks and mobile vendors is damning, and the director of the Ann Arbor District Library has been very clear about the inherent challenges of using that space for library events. If and when the results of the RFP come in, any project approaching the drawing shared by Proposal A supporters will come at a cost of millions, or more likely tens of millions of dollars, and there is no source for that funding.  The ballot proposal included no funding component, and when Proposal A was on the ballot, the key supporters and organizers of the initiative assured us that city taxpayer money would not be required and that private money would flow in. Yet, it's taken us five years to finally put together the comparatively little funding just for the RFP.  I am therefore asking City Council members to take a hard and honest look at where the project currently stands in contrast to what the public was led to believe and the opportunity costs of allowing this process to continue. The people of Ann Arbor deserve better.  It's painful to think of what might have been. We could have had much needed housing. We could have had one or two floors of retail behind the plaza to create traffic flowing through it, making the space a space where people feel safe and relaxed.  In other words, we could have activated that space. We could have had a public closet that was privately maintained, and our city could have had revenue from the 100-year lease, from new property taxes, and from running a portion of the parking structure beneath. And our city's kids might have even had a seasonal splash pad and outdoor ice skating.  Please, take that hard and honest look and act boldly and realistically and find a new path beyond Proposal A to reinvent and activate this space.

I'm here today to ask for one small addition to the budget that was just proposed by City Administrator DeHoney. Very much appreciate your excellent presentation on that.  The council may remember that back in January of 2022, the council approved a feasibility study into municipalization as well as some other energy options. That study was funded in September of 22, and it's going to be finishing here in about June of this year. We do not know the results of that study yet. However, if that study is positive, the next step would be to get a valuation of DTE's assets.  Ann Arbor for Public Power is suggesting that we reserve some amount of money in the budget to pay for that study should we decide to do it. We originally proposed $500,000 for that study. However, after talking to other communities that have done this study, they believe that it'd be considerably cheaper than that. So we're amending our proposal to $250,000 reserved to get a hard valuation of the assets.  What that valuation will do is it will help with the city's legal proceedings to be able to go to DTE with a good offer for the price of their assets should we decide to go through with the acquisition process. Mayor Taylor actually just gave an excellent interview where he outlined the process for moving forward with municipalization on state side. I'd definitely recommend all of you go and listen to that.

My name is Sarah Ellen Strongman. I moved to Ann Arbor in 2018. I've been a resident in Ward four since I moved here.  And I'm here today to talk about the so-called center of the city. The election where Prop A appeared on the ballot was the first election in Michigan that I was eligible to participate in. My parents raised me to be an active citizen, and I registered to vote as soon as I moved here and was eligible. I read all about, you know, the various elections happening. I read up about Prop A.  And I remember thinking, well, this is silly. It's obviously not going to pass. In particular, I remember reading a story, I think in the Observer, where they interviewed proponents and opponents of Prop A. And of the proponents picked were a couple who said that any building on the lot would block the view from their $500,000 condo. And I was really surprised when it passed.  However, I have sadly not been surprised by the complete lack of progress that the so-called Center of the City Commission has made. I recently saw a number of tweets about the work that wasn't being done at this commission.  people smoking and drinking during public meetings. Just last week, I was walking down Division downtown to meet a friend, and the only people I saw anywhere near that lot using it were people, were a couple of teenagers on skateboards, who were actually on their way to Liberty Plaza, because that seemed like a better place to be able to try and do, you know, kickflips or whatever.  City Administrator Dahomey's recent report outlining the many ways that quote unquote activating the center of the city as a place for  food trucks, was thorough, honest, and, you know, as a previous commenter said, damning.

But it's also backed up by actual planning and expertise, which the center of the city doesn't have. We need to put our money where our mouths are and use them for things that are important.

I am also calling in to ask Council to take action to address the lack of progress that we've seen at the library-laden surface parking lot. In the nearly five years since voters narrowly passed the Charter Amendment to turn that parking lot into a public commons, there's been next to no progress towards that goal. The site remains a surface parking lot, the city is out tens of millions of dollars, and we're further behind in building much-needed housing as a result.  If Prop A hadn't passed, we surely would have had a free, usable public plaza in the splash pad by now, along with $5 million more in the affordable housing fund. The current state of the site, as emphasized by AC1 on tonight's agenda, suggests that significant resources would be required to transform it into a suitable space for even hosting food trucks, resources that we are understandably hesitant to allocate. The last meeting of the Council of the Commons  At that meeting one committee member appeared to be fully baked while the committee discussed and at best half-baked RFP for the space. It also seems that Library Green have been sitting on funds for who knows how long that they simply chose not to spend to accelerate the RFP. If the beginning of a draft RFP and  maybe food trucks, is all the progress we've had in five years, it's time to cut our losses and move on. Whether we repeal Prop A entirely or replace it with something more flexible, I would like to see us put the issue to voters this year. The longer we wait, the worse it is for everyone involved. We must make a decision as soon as possible to be able to move forward.

I sent this to Council as an email, but I wanted to call in and read it into the record. I read this astoundingly brutal, I might add, memo last night and was struck by three things. First, Proposal A was passed in 2018, and we're only now looking at options such as food trucks.  We're coming up on five years. Everything about the center of the city and Council of the Commons or whatever the correct style to refer to this is has had a lack of urgency. We are coming up on the bicentennial with nothing to show for it. The Council of the Commons is still working on putting together a design RFP after nearly five years. I watched the most recent meeting and it was a disaster with one member interrupting and monopolizing much of the discussion time with a list of 18 vague amendments.  Towards the end of the meeting, he appeared to, as our elders would say, toke up. Looking back on the minutes from previous meetings, it doesn't seem as if they report much back to council, and it isn't clear to me what they've been doing all this time. Second, $130,000 a year for food trucks, if we can even do food trucks with the poorly worded charter language Proposal A saddled us with, and if we can find operators willing to take us up on it.  And I'll just use the proposed ballot explainer text for this, quote, four, the charter amendment does not provide a funding source for the development, maintenance, or programming of a park and commons, unquote. We don't have money to put food trucks here.  Please put an end to this charade. Don't let it drag on for another year or five. Dissolve the Council of the Commons so they stop wasting staff time and the time of the two council members sitting on that body. They aren't seeming to act as an advisory body to council anyway, so I don't think we would be losing anything without their input.  Pass a ballot initiative that allows voters to fix the mistake of Proposal A. Either strike the language entirely or, preferably, modify it so that the space can be developed to provide a public plaza, housing, and money for city priorities, which could include affordable housing, climate, active transportation, unarmed response, debt service, et cetera.  I don't want this issue to still be hanging over our heads while we are supposed to be celebrating the bicentennial. It's time to move on.

This is Eric Zucker up in Ward two. I just like to add my name to the folks who've already speak and spoken about the center of the city tonight. I really think that it's time to re examine this and put a valid initiative to the voters to let us decide.  Once and for all, after everything that we've seen over the past four plus years, whether it's worth putting any more time, effort, and money into this broken initiative that we embarked on, ostensibly for a public plaza, but really to stop a development downtown. A lot of the supporters who remain after the development was stopped are still divided in purpose and scope.  Other than a small flower bed, maybe a handful of events over the four-plus years, this parking lot is much as it was, with no real plans to change it anytime soon. I think the city administrator's memo is correct, and I think his plans for the rest of the city sound really well thought out and wonderful, and in stark contrast to what this group has come up with. It's time to cut bait. There's a dawning recognition in our city  that we must adapt and change to meet the growing crises of climate housing. And if we're going to devote time and energy into something, then let it be that, not window dressing on a parking lot.  The only way to change the use for this lot now is by amending the city charter and putting it to the voters. And it's within your scope as our city's elected leaders to do just that. And I urge you to do it. Do it this year. Put a ballot proposal forward and let the voters decide. Either to maintain the status quo as it is now, or come up with a new, progressive use of this plot that is right next to  the bus depot near the library. Something better than a parking lot.

Champions for Change  It's a program that recognizes that in vibrant communities all people are welcomed, included, valued, and nurtured. The racial disparities our communities face though prove that we're not there. Champions for Change inspires and cultivates leaders as we all work toward a co-liberated future. Together we can find new ways to disrupt the many forms of racism. Our community of practice is a space for imagination, healing, experimentation, and transformation.  Leaders of color are nurtured and supported as they grow. White leaders learn ways to wholeheartedly leverage their power and privilege for justice. Together, we're laying the groundwork for systemic change in our communities. I hope, as folks remember Jude's impact in our community, we can also uplift these efforts that will continue.

Speaking of violence, we have not had physical violence here at the table, but we have had rhetorical violence in our chambers, yet again with anti-Semitism and Holocaust denialism.  Although it does not affect an immediate, approximate physical harm, it does create harm in the community and of course leads to physical harm over the course of time, time, and time again. It is entirely without reservation but deep contempt.

That agreement required Gelman to install monitoring wells to detect dioxane near the Montgomery Street well, which was previously used as a source for the city's public drinking water.  If concentrations of dioxane in a first series of these monitoring wells exceeded one half of the residential cleanup criterion, Gelman was supposed to install a second series of these wells. When the state of Michigan reduced the dioxane drinking water cleanup criterion from 85 parts per billion to 7.2 parts per billion, that trigger became much easier to reach. And indeed, it was reached.  And so Gelman was supposed to install a second series of these wells. And it did not. So Gelman refused to do what it had said it would do. And so that fact establishes that it is both timely and prudent to enforce the city's rights to have the second series of wells installed by litigation, which is what this amendment supports.  These wells are important for the residents of Ann Arbor because they provide a warning system for contamination moving toward the Northwest Supply Well, the Montgomery Street Well, and there is money involved. If it becomes clear that concentrations of dioxane in the Montgomery Street Well are so high as to disqualify this well permanently as a source of residential drinking water, then Gelman may be required to make a significant payment to the city.

That's number three. Our current comprehensive plan is vast. There are some 13 documents, I think. I forget the last time I counted it. We would like  this team to develop recommendations and policies that promote fewer zoning districts or categories, that contain more flexibility for reuse and adaptability over time, and that reconcile the differences among these many, many documents we currently have. Four is value centricity. A proposed land use framework should emphasize values over specified land use limitations where possible. And finally, engage in repair of a history of exclusion.

My name is Matt Kulhanek. I'm the fleet and facilities manager for the city as well as the airport manager for the city and I appreciate the opportunity. I did receive four questions related to this agenda item.  from council members, and I'd just like to go through those. First question was, what happens in the event that Heron Aviation isn't able to find a new FBO partner? And it's good to report that Heron Aviation has actually already reached an agreement with Ace Aircraft to provide FBO services in Ann Arbor. Ace Aircraft, which is one of the two remaining proposals from the RFP 2119, has purchased the materials, supplies, and equipment  on the outgoing FBO Aviation Center. Aviation Center has also transferred their six leases for adjacent T-hangers to Ace Aircraft. Ace Aircraft is owned by Aaron Enzer, a long-time pilot, flight instructor, and tenant at the airport. He's also currently the president of the Ann Arbor Flyers and operates two local businesses. Second question was, what criteria  were part of the original recommendation to grant the lease to Great Lakes Air Repair DBA Beacon Aviation. So the Airport Advisory Committee has been trying to find the right FBO operator for the airport over a period of about three years through two RFP processes. The proposal from Herron and Forshler, which ended up being the Great Lakes Air Beacon Aviation, was recommended by the Airport Advisory Committee for several reasons.  The proposal benefited users of the airport by providing a competitive FBO environment. The proposers brought a good mix of business experience, and they were providing some new services to ARB, and they bring the solid financial resources to complete the required improvements to the building with no airport contributions. The third question was, was the airport advisory committee part of this decision?  If not, why? The airport advisory has been an active participant in the plan to redevelop this site for many years. Members, including those who served on the subcommittee that was developed for this specific proposal or process, have gone through two RFP processes, reviewed multiple proposals, and interviewed multiple proposers.", "start": 7768.169, "end": 7920.662, "Transition": "\"\"", "Meeting Section": "Other", "Speaker Role": "Other", "is_public_comment": 0, "is_public_hearing": 0, "is_comment_start_trigger": 0, "is_comment_end_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_start_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_end_trigger": 0}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_11", "text": "The subcommittee re-evaluated the remaining proposals from Solo Aviation and Ace Aircraft, and the newly received proposal from Heron and Foshler. The subcommittee recommended to the Airport Advisory Committee, who concurred at their May 18th, 22 meeting, to move the Heron-Foshler proposal into the due diligence phase, and if it didn't make through the due diligence, then to pursue the proposal with Ace Aircraft. So as it relates to this most recent activity,  The request from Dale Forsler to put the lease in Heron's company name, Heron Aviation Group, came on March 22nd of this year, a week after the Airport Advisory Committee's March meeting and nearly two months before their next scheduled meeting. While a special meeting could have been called with discussions with the chair of the committee, the inclusion of Ace Aircraft into the Heron Aviation proposal was consistent with the recommendations previously made by the Airport Advisory Committee  ACE was a known commodity. They were a known commodity, and they were a known proposal to the Airport Advisory Committee, having been already an applicant through the RFP process. The last question was, what's the standard process for recommending lease agreements with a particular partner? There's really no established process for this situation at the airport.  Most of our leases are T-hangers, box hangers, and some private hanger land leases. These are formatted leases. They're standardized. They've been developed by the city attorney's office and at some point in the past have been approved by city council. Those are the bulk of the leases that we handle. Those are handled administratively.  and they usually are filled off of an operating or operating off of a waiting list for hanger space. What city council does see is lease extensions for corporate hangers, some amendments, those type of things when necessary. We don't see a lot of that because we don't get a lot of turnover, but when we do see it, it's typically an amendment or a renewal of an existing lease for the same tenant. This situation is very different in regards to  Actually, in the 16 plus years I've been the airport manager, it's the first time I can remember that we've brought in a new corporate entity for a corporate hangar. Again, most of the time, actually, since I've been here, all the time, it's just been renewal or amendments to leases, the same tenant staying in the same building. So this one was a little different situation, and again, it's just not one that's a unique situation, not one that they have a standard process for.

I'd be happy to address additional questions the council may have.", "start": 7952.007, "end": 8126.424, "Transition": "\"\"", "Meeting Section": "Other", "Speaker Role": "Other", "is_public_comment": 0, "is_public_hearing": 0, "is_comment_start_trigger": 0, "is_comment_end_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_start_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_end_trigger": 0}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_34", "text": "Thank you.

I'm very sorry for your loss. Good evening, my name is Muffy McKenzie and I live at 217 3rd Street. I am one of the houses in the old Westside Historic District that abut the 415 property.  I do want to say that I have a problem with the PUD change and it's mostly because I think that the point about remediating the contaminated brownfield site. I've asked this many times, where is the urgency to clean up these dangerous carcinogenic  carcinogen taxons. Sorry, I'm a little nervous. The city has known about these taxons for many years. Now we found out that there are more and a plume that is spreading. Why are we waiting for would-be developer? Why aren't we cleaning these taxons up yesterday? We were told that it'll be too expensive. Well, how much?  We've been asking for months the data and the facts on the cost and not received any straightforward answer. We've heard millions. We've heard one to three million. But how much? Where is the transparency on this? How do we know it's too expensive if we don't know how much it's going to cost?  Also, hasn't the DDA been collecting money for years on this parking lot? Where is that money? Why couldn't some of that money be used for the cleanup? What about the millions of dollars that the federal government gave to the city and what the city received? One of the council members on the planning commission a few weeks ago said that that money was being used for worthy projects.  Well, what could be more worthy than the health and safety of our 10 hours a day who have toxins nearby? I don't know. Cleaning up the contamination now seems to be the most worthy item on my agenda. I don't know what you all think about that. What it boils down to is that 415 is a city-owned property.  The city and the county contributed to the contamination over the years. The city has a duty and a responsibility to its residents to clean it up, and clean it up now, not waiting for some would-be developer.

So I spoke earlier about honesty, intellectual honesty, about respecting our laws, the letter and intent, clearly does not respect the intent of our code, may very well not meet the letter of the law either.  Especially because this is a city application, not a private development application, we should be holding ourselves to the standard of meeting our own laws.

One of the things our guidelines say is that this needs to be designed to fit in and be compatible with the contributing structures in the historic district.  that were given to the historic district commission at working sessions, not an application that was voted on, but at working sessions, continue to show comparisons to structures off-site, outside of the district, and to non-contributed structures within the district. The guidelines are clear. We're contributing as very important and meaningful historic district ordinances. This project needs to be designed to be compatible  contributing structures in a historic district.

There was one architectural, which should be completely built upon. And the other was an open, which I'll discuss. And the other was sort of a blended emphasis. And I think the blended emphasis is finally what is coming before you.  I understand there's some compromises and a willingness to take care of the toxic site. There's always been suspicions, and we looked at that, about those issues certainly there. It's always been a past industrial area, so there's going to be some problems there.

If I'm listening to you guys talk tonight and I'm looking at the trend and even many of the public speakers vote on the matter, I get it.

We need to respect our floodplains and the floodway. When I sat on the Grounds Creek Greenway Task Force, I and a plurality of the members looked at the open emphasis.  which was to protect our floodplain and our front bridges. And we believe that the best way for it, the tree line or the greenway, was to use the city sites as kind of centers for a park-like system.

My biggest concern has to do with public health and safety and the overlapping issues of the flood risk at that site, which is an unknown and mapped by FEMA floodplain and flood fringe area. And to place that in the context of climate change and our climate emergency, during which we expect more  and frequent intensity \u2013 and intense flood events. Keep that in mind, because what's been proposed is only what's been known to date. So we just don't know the potential for the flooding. But our stormwater manager has said that this plan is one that will \u2013 is opposed to the Hazardous Risk Management Plan  for the city, and that makes me really concerned for the safety of the potential residents at that site, as well as those who may be called into action to support them in the case of a disaster. Combined with that is the risk of contamination that we know exists, and I feel like the attention has been paid specifically to the boundaries of the site.  and the contamination on the site. When we know that the contamination is a subsurface area around the site in a whole neighborhood, so it's not only the contaminants on site, but the  a plume of PCE that's flowing in the direction of that site that hasn't been adequately addressed. We don't know what the plan will result in in terms of control of the contamination over time and the control of the remediation. And that has me concerned.  Thank you. Also, well, I just think that if the federal government won't give money to support affordable housing in this place because it's at risk of flooding, then I think that it's probably a risky place for any person to be living. And I support the open space approach to use of those sites because it is compatible  with the actual natural features of the site, which is in a floodplain on the route to the Huron River.

My name is Mark Wishko. I live at 211 3rd Street. My property backs right up to 415 West Washington. I have been there for 45 years. I have watched the city neglect this site for all of those years.  And what we have today is a blighted site, the responsibility of the city. And now we're going to have a development that's going to create a wall between the neighborhood and downtown. And then the city is saying, I want somebody else to pay for this because, geez, it's too expensive for us. We have neglected the site for all of these years. We have contaminated it.  yet we don't want to pay for it? And we want to put people at risk by building in a floodplain? I am totally confused by this. We have the ability to be able to make this a transition from the neighborhood to downtown, not put up a wall between the neighborhood and downtown. We have a historic district that is supposed to provide that, yet this organization is trying to tear that down.  and work their way around the Historic District Commission. I'm aghast at this. This is just, to me, it's beyond comprehension that the city will neglect its own responsibility, look to put it upon a developer, and then walk away happy because, gee, we put up this big wall. We circumvented the Historic District Commission. We require all of the people that live in this historic district to abide by the Historic District Commission.  Right? Okay.

I would echo the comments made by the opponents of this resolution. Many good points have been made. I think the one key one that I would like to emphasize is that  Can you really expect a developer to clean up anything beyond this site? It seems to me that the city is going to have to clean up the plume that surrounds this site. And how are you going to coordinate that cleanup without having control of the edges of it? Just think about that one piece alone.  I think is enough to get past the temptation to just have a developer do it so the city doesn't have to pay for it. The city is, after all, responsible for it from the get. There's no question about that, zero. And the city should take some responsibility here, regardless of what the cost is. Bond it if you have to. That's what you're supposed to do. The other point that I'd like to make is that if you go back to the very beginning of this process,  there have been some serious misrepresentations made by certain people during the course of it. The early webinars and the early meetings and surveys had a questionnaire that asked for goals and prioritizing of those goals. The lowest priority in the entire survey, both residents nearby and citywide, the last lowest score was for selling this property  in order to generate money for the Affordable Housing Fund. The bottom. Yet that has been the overriding goal. And now it's been pointed out several times that you won't even get any money for the Affordable Housing Fund because the developer will obviously just discount the purchase price by the amount that they would have to pay in. So the entire goal, which was ranked last  and has been driving this bus in any way, is a phantom. And if you approve this, just with those two components, let alone Jerry Hancock saying that it shouldn't be built there, and he's the stormwater manager, et cetera, et cetera, all the competing considerations that have been discussed, they are nauseam.  are just going to be the competing considerations always go by the boards in order to support new market rate, i.e. luxury housing, which will not produce any improvement in affordability whatsoever.

We heard a variety of different viewpoints on this rezoning and  You know, this is obviously a very complex site for our community. The city vacated the property in 2007, 16 years ago. So we've been through a pretty exhaustive process to date to get us to where we're at right now. We have evaluated a variety of different proposals. We have looked at adaptive reuse. We've done studies on flooding of the site. We've put out an RFP in the past.  And and not been able to see that move forward and that's what's helped to inform us to what we are where we're at today and in taking this approach to identify what the community values are with this site and then develop a proposal that we can go back out to the development community with those priorities so that we can get something back that That meets our our community goals and values You know I've we heard  Variety of different comments tonight today, but I did want to touch on a couple of them one of which is is Fundamentally the the fact that this is a blighted and polluted site and that it's this is our site This is a contamination that we have contributed to as a city and that it's our duty and responsibility To clean it up and to clean it up now, and I I don't disagree with that at all that is  You know it is our responsibility to do that and and as I look at this proposal before us That's one of the reasons that that helps to motivate me to to believe that this is the right process For us to move forward when we get to I don't look at this as is the city We are asking developers to pay for this and  We will be paying for this. We would be using our brownfield, using a brownfield plan eventually to help pay for the cleanup of this. But it would be initially, that cleanup would be paid for by private development and it would be ultimately paid back  much of it through development, through tax dollars, through that tax revenue. So what we're not doing is going to our general fund right now to clean that up. And instead, we are able to get delivered a lot of our other community priorities in the process. We're building  more housing. We are protecting the chimney swifts that are there. We are identifying, we're protecting, not building in the floodplain. We are increasing our open space in that area.

The rezoning petition is accompanied by a concept plan.  for an elevated residential structure of about 134,000 square feet that will be five stories at its highest point. A minimum of 60% of the site is required to be preserved as open space, and the tree-lined trail will be built by the supplemental regs. It is required to be built through that space. Affordable housing is also required and must be provided, the greater of 15% or 15 units.  The units may be provided on site, or a payment in lieu equivalent may be made. And we've thrown in one final requirement for good measure, which is the preservation of the Chimney Swift habitat. And I'm not trying to make light of habitats. I'm just trying to underscore that, yes, this is a complex site that many community values have been introduced into.  So yes, it is true that this site cannot be developed primarily for affordable housing, as the other city-owned sites are being developed, because we would need federal funding to subsidize such a development, and federal funding cannot be used here. But that doesn't mean that there couldn't be affordable housing units on the site, or that it won't pay into our fund. Now, the cleanup will be expensive. At this stage, we only have estimates to work with, but it sounds like it's up to a million.  to deal with the contamination, double that or more to dismantle the existing asbestos-filled building, and then more to establish reasonable stormwater control. You all heard tonight Mr. DeHoney say that he left one million unallocated from the general fund. This cleanup would require three times that, and so if we were to try to fund this out of general fund funds,  we would need to not do things that people urgently want us to do. You are absolutely right that this is the city's responsibility to clean up, and we are exercising that responsibility through the use of brownfield tax credits, which are designed exactly for the purposes of development and environmental cleanup, and which the city uses regularly. Finally, we've heard concern about residential development in a flood plain.  The concept plan would significantly improve the flood control that exists currently. The concept plan would remove a structure that sits below the flood plain, provide stormwater management where there currently is none, none at all, clean up on-site contamination, and halt both the in-migration and out-migration of further contamination, significantly reduce impervious surface.  and conform fully with the city's revised and strengthened floodplain ordinance, which was written by Mr. Jerry Hancock, who also wrote the hazard mitigation plan.

We're just speaking to the possibility once this is rezoned as a PUD  But I just want to point to how we've done this pretty close to where the site is in Kerrytown.

Here the city is using the Brownfield plan not to clean up a site, but rather to advance other goals.  It's sometimes appropriate to reward developers with a brownfield tax credit for doing something non-environmental that benefits the public. But this is tricky. There is no clear line between a useful tax trade-off and a taxpayer giveaway to the developer. We need to be mindful of bad policy, overpaying, and favoritism. Staff negotiates these deals out of public view so they require sunlight.  And once adopted, TIF tax credits are invisible. They don't show up in property tax bills, on millages, or in the city budget. The affected government entities, city, county, school board, district library, and mental health, often don't even know that they're missing the millage revenue, which can run into the millions just for non-environmental. The city is effectively deciding for all these entities. That's another reason for strict oversight.  So these plans, especially the non-environmental elements, need careful scrutiny on the front end. That's why council voted unanimously in April 2003 to establish the review committee. Please keep it intact. This is a very capable city council. But you simply do not have the time or the bandwidth at your meetings to fully vet these complex and opaque plans.  You may argue that the city's brownfield policy, adopted in 2019, reduces the need for review. In fact, it adds a layer of complexity that makes separate review even more important. By dissolving the committee, you are also eliminating one of two chances for public comment. In conclusion, this committee poses no burden  and provides needed oversight for the discretionary removal of millions in taxpayer dollars from the tax rolls for non-environmental purposes.

I live at 1210 Brooklyn Avenue. I was enlightened by Ken Garber's description of the Brownfield Plan Review Committee's infrequent meetings. I think I've been to two of those 12 meetings over the span of the last 10 years. I remember waiting a long time for minutes for some of them.  One of the things that I think he brought up and I'll repeat is just the relatively light administrative burden for this committee relative to the relatively large sums being expended on brownfield remediation and the tax dollars that go with that.  A couple hours a year of oversight and a couple hours a year of listening to public commentary on these sorts of efforts seems like a good investment.  The challenge with brownfields is that as a city we tend to forget what came before us. We forget that there was a chemist living at and doing his chemical experiments at what is now the Science Center. We forget where all of the landfills and dumps were. We just forget. People from a hundred years ago are not around now to tell us.  where not to go. And so we're rediscovering or discovering, or like some people know of course, but most people don't, just how expensive it is to take land that we've destroyed and bring it back up to a space where it can be reused. And I think just for the public stewardship of the land that's under the city's orbit, I think it's a good idea to keep this  keep this function visible. I did look for other organizations that also have brownfield oversight, and I did find the county, which does a pretty credible job of meeting on a regular basis and reporting on, on a regular basis, their efforts. An equivalent web search of the city website was not as anywhere near as useful. So I guess the request is if you're  If you're going to decide to remove the review committee, my ask would be please put a mandate to report out on brownfield activities on perhaps an annual basis to describe the locations under use and the funds expended or not collected and make sure that people can keep tabs on bad decisions of the past and hopefully remediate it in the future.

First topic, Brownfield Committee. I would echo the comments by the two preceding speakers. I think they were well thought out.  I just want to say this, the committee currently has the task of reviewing multi-million dollar brownfield TIF plans, one to a year. One of the policy standards previously set is that a developer asking for TIF dollars for non-environmental items has to give a percentage to affordable housing. The committee recently, including some new members,  Matt overrode a staff recommendation of denial on the village project because the developer didn't propose any housing dollars in return for the non-environmental items, and then recommended dissolving itself. I understand that Council Member Song said a while back, essentially, don't worry about this. The county also has to approve and does its own due diligence, so there's other regulatory bodies here. The county just recently met,  On the same village project, several commissioners said, essentially, we should defer the city. So it appears that's really not a viable solution. It's our oversight, the city's oversight, that is going to essentially be potentially rubber-stamped by the county. And the commissioners essentially said that. And so did the person in charge of that for the county. These are big dollar projects. This is big affordable housing dollars.  I think shirking responsibility to carefully review these plans is a mistake. Next topic, the Brooks Street construction. The first issue, the bid process. There have been some past discussions, some heated, of the best value policy. There were often memos describing the bid amounts along with the differences in contract to practice.  To be transparent, we should be able to see the additional amounts we're paying over the low bid and what we're presumably getting for those extra dollars. But all the contracts on today's agenda, at least as far as I could tell, don't have that information. They just have the raw scores. That's a pretty good way to prevent any critiques of the bid process. You can't see the additional dollars and you have to guess what the perceived value was.  On several recent contracts, the deciding factor was worker development. What was that? An apprenticeship program maybe? Better training? Isn't the public entitled to have some idea of what we're actually getting for the extra dollars? As to the project itself, I live a block away. I just hope that the promise will be kept is that there will be some curb bump-outs to save some of the dozens of mature trees which are in the past for both sidewalks.  I walk that street regularly and with no safety concerns and I'll be sad if all the trees are cut down to say nothing of the last climate benefits of having it.

No council member, past or present, has corrected any of the claims made during those 12 appearances. How do most people, myself included,  come to understand this historical event.

Sexual assault is the only crime, violent, or property in which our city has a higher incidence rate per capita than the rest of Michigan and the country at large. That rate has increased over the last 10 years. 43% of U.S. women experience some form of sexual violence. One in three U.S. women experience some form of physical violence. That's over 20,000 women each impacted in this city.  Black, indigenous, people of color, transgender, non-binary, and lower-income citizens experience higher rates of gender-based violence along with increased severity, duration, and fatality.  Prior incidents of gender-based violence is the single greatest predictor of mass shootings. 63% of all mass shooters have histories of gender-based violence. Aggression towards women, including stalking, harassment, as well as physical violence, is predictive of other violent crime.  I understand that domestic violence victim services are provided by outside agencies, usually at the county level. I am not calling for duplicating those services, I am asking for prevention. A city resident who feels unsafe calls city emergency responders. Jude once called the police department for aid when an ex was refusing to leave her home. They wouldn't intervene until a man with influence in the city called and demanded action on her behalf.  Over 10 years ago, I remember Jude complained about people using her backyard as a shortcut to West Park from Delanus and downtown. When she and neighbors applied for a fence permit, they were denied because their homes were in a floodplain. Her murderer accessed her home from the rear and was staying at Delanus. Please take a moment to let that sink in. Those are just two stories from Jude's experience. There are more which signal opportunities  lost to increase her safety as a single woman living alone. And there are so many more citizens with story of gender-based violence and harassment to tell. Each of those stories could lead to an action at the city governance level that would show we as a city are willing to step up to the challenge of responding adequately to the risk posed to vulnerable citizens.  The research is abundant. The funding for this work at the state and federal level is abundant. We have a community capacity and expertise. We have gender-based violence programs at every level of government except in this city. Thank you. Do we have the will? What would you do in your place? Please honor her legacy by seriously considering this request.

My name is Dr. Lauren Sargent. I live on Ember Way in Ann Arbor. I'm an Ann Arbor resident for almost 40 years, a fourth generation Michigander. And tonight, I am urging all of you here to exercise courage.  Please speak unanimously with one clear voice. Ann Arbor will stop permitting investments in toxic and climate disrupting gas infrastructure. No vote, or not even bringing a vote before us,  is a no vote. It's a no vote on climate action that we absolutely urgently require. We're in a declared climate emergency. We have an A20 goal of powering our grid with 100% renewables by 2030. There is no possible way that we can even approximate this goal unless we stop permitting investment in fossil fuel infrastructure right here in Ann Arbor.  We need to electrify everything and power it with renewables and efficiency. We at Washtenaw 350 have a motto. When you're in a hole, first stop digging. Gas infrastructure is a huge, gaping hole, perhaps the largest that we here can control. We need to cut that off immediately.  Today I just read that in a part of southern France there are three communes that have no water. That's 3,000 people who have no water. There are forest fires raging in those areas that don't normally even start until maybe July or August. And they've cut off water for everything except for hygiene and emergency medical use. No agriculture. That's today.  The Energy, Environmental, and Renters Commissions have all passed resolutions calling for no new gas infrastructure for new and substantially remodeled buildings. Please schedule and vote yes on a gas ban. You, as council members, are the only ones who have the ability to make this policy a reality. Please. We need to put this community's money where our mouth is. We need to act as if our hair is on fire.  the forests already are.

Somewhere approximating maybe 500,000 Roma, gypsies were killed by Hitler. Yeah, that all happened.

Many Germans stood by and watched as Jewish people were pushed into gas chambers and murdered. Many Germans stood by and watched that happen.

And they want us to believe they are not racist. They are racist. A holocaust happened 80 years ago and people like Ann Arbor City Council allowed it to go on.  At the same time in Germany when people were being killed by Nazis, very few Germans stood up and said no. Those people are rarely remembered. I am those who stood up against the genocide. I am among those who stands against murder of Palestinians and you are  doing exactly what German public did while Nazis were murdering Jewish population.  You are the racist Mayor Taylor. You are the racist City of Ann Arbor City Council people. You are the racist. You are the anti-Semite. I am not. I am against racism and I am against all kinds of Holocaust and I have fought against all kinds of racism. My record shows it.  It is shameful that you hide behind 80 years ago Holocaust and allow one to happen right now. It is obvious you're lying.

I'm here to speak in favor of the unarmed crisis response and wellness check proposal with a personal story, a story of mental health. My wife and I married in 2018 and enjoyed two years as newlyweds, then COVID hit. In quarantine and also working from home, we spent 24 hours a day and seven days a week together for years.  Through counseling, we also learned that both my wife and I suffer from severe childhood trauma. For everyone in this room who has had a relationship or is in a relationship, I think can respect the fireworks that that recipe just cooked up. In the fall of last year, an argument rose to crisis level. For the first time, I was scared.  It was late on a Sunday evening when neither one of us could reach our counselors. I felt so over my head I called 911. A friend had recently told me about unarmed crisis wellness checks. I asked the dispatcher, please send an unarmed response team for a wellness check. 30 minutes later, three police cars arrived. We both cooperated, but I believed I was asked leading questions while in a vulnerable state for the purpose of making an arrest.  I don't fault the police. They were extremely compassionate and helpful. But because my wife had self-harmed and because I had a small cut and a bruise, my wife was arrested. But this is not a story with a sad ending. My wife and I got the counseling, we're in a great place together, and we're overcoming a lifetime of childhood trauma together. We've learned to support each other and are in a functioning and healthy marriage.  Spending the night in jail was extremely traumatic for my wife. It was also costly. Legal fees, logistics, hotel rooms, court costs put expenses over $10,000. But I can never erase the vision of my wife being walked to a patrol car in handcuffs, especially when I feel unarmed mental support was all I was calling for.  Although the case was dismissed, my wife still has an arrest on her record and I now fear for her citizenship. I loved reading the report.  On the unarmed crisis support team's status, last year it looked like money from the Federal American Rescue Plan Act was directed to the program. And according to a group called the Coalition for Revisioning Our Safety in Washtenaw County, that funding would allow the program to operate for the first year. Could that be the beginning? While other sources of funding are secured, I sincerely hope so.

The previous speakers have done a wonderful job of covering many aspects of this. So I'm going to broaden what I'm going to say about it into what I see as a pattern, a pattern of deregulation and reduced oversight.  Now, I'm an entrepreneur, I'm a capitalist, I believe in capitalism, but I believe in regulated capitalism. I don't want the Wild West in capitalism, and I don't want the Wild West in government. Government has a role to play. As one of the speakers said, you are our representatives. Whenever you reduce the amount of oversight, public scrutiny, public hearings,  public information as provided. It reduces that window of the public, of the people you represent, of the citizens of Ann Arbor, into how our government works. This particular item has to do with a lot of money and a relatively infrequent amount of time that society needs to meet.  But it's very important. The whole function of the Southfield TIF aspect of cleaning up sites, especially orphan sites, is very valuable to get sites cleaned up that otherwise might not. But a lot of money changes hands. A lot of money, tax dollars, are involved. Public scrutiny should be not just allowed, but embraced.  Journalism is reduced these days, we all know that. Therefore, we need more public scrutiny, not less public scrutiny, whenever we have the opportunity. I believe dissolving this committee reduces the public scrutiny, reduces your helping us to have a window into how government works and how government deals with our tax dollars.  There have been some good things that have come out of the Brownfield tip in my neighborhood, in the Lower Town project. Unfortunately, $9 million of affordable housing went by the wayside with an improper decision. In the Brownfield tip, 15 units, 15 units of affordable housing. We lost 93, but we got 15 in a Brownfield negotiation. Just one small example of where a council member was proud of what he felt he negotiated.  into a brownfield active group financing situation.

It's remarkably clean. It's well organized. It has enormous blocks of tin, aluminum, plastic bottles, all of these things that go to commodity markets. But we also saw a few blocks of plastic film.  These blocks contained giant dog food bags and other forms of containers that cannot be recycled. We want to redouble our commitment to get these out of our waste stream.  Maybe some of you participated in a pilot that we had a couple of years ago, and that remains in place at El Jarrisa, among other places, where you get your takeout food in a container that you can bring back. They will clean it and give it to you again. Perhaps not in that very minute, but know that it remains in circulation.  And they would like your feedback to help them figure out how to do that. So look for a series of interactive community workshops from May 22nd to 25th. I will provide more details when I hear them. And I also received some drop-off station fee waivers. This is where you take things that you cannot curbside recycle, like styrofoam, metal items, textiles, motor oil, cooking oil. This waives the $3 entrance fee.

We will talk about this in much greater detail when the item comes up on the agenda, but I did want to address it in my council member comments because we did have so many public commenters address the Brownfield Review Committee dissolution. And so I just very briefly, for those who may be tuning in and then maybe tuning out before we get to that point on the agenda,  What we are doing is going to increase public participation and transparency regarding the Brownfield review process. Instead of a small committee that meets, you know, quietly when the public isn't paying attention and, you know, receives the presentation from the developer at that point,  that part is going away, the entire body here will receive that presentation from the developer and will be able to consider the plan as a body. So that provides greater public scrutiny, it provides greater transparency, and it provides for the entire of the council to ask the questions of the developer. It also streamlines the process, yes.  Because we don't want to ask the developer to come give that presentation twice. They shouldn't need to do that That just adds extra cost to the development process and that is something that we are trying to address because we're trying to bring down those costs where possible in order to make development in our city more affordable and to open it up to more people and  who may not have access to loads of capital. So we can see some different types of developers doing projects in our community. So again, for those who may be tuning out, we'll talk about it again later, but it is going to increase transparency and public participation, not decrease it.

So I spent several hours on Friday, which appropriately was Workers Memorial Day, looking at the worker safety information included in Fonsen's proposal for CA5. What I found was highly concerning and prompted me to also review an earlier project that we approved here at the table in March with that same company.  So for both RFPs, Fonsen listed the same incomplete OSHA training information. OSHA certificates for only four employees. Three of those certificates were from 2011. Along with an email indicating that just seven more employees were signed up for training sessions in January and March.  However, in both RFPs under a different section, the section for ratio of masters to apprentices, they list more than two dozen other employees, none of whom are OSHA certified or will be according to their own proposals. So in contrast, the contractor who won second place in this bid submitted OSHA certificates for 34 of its employees.  Um so from these proposals, Fonsen admitted and revealed that they have just two laborers who will supposedly have the training by the time construction begins. The nine other employees who have the training certificates are foreman or management. It begs the question, where are the OSHA certificates for the people who will be doing the actual work? Because I know it won't be the foreman or the management.  Therefore, before I can feel comfortable approving this proposal tonight, I'm going to propose an amendment that makes it crystal clear to Fonsen and to everyone else that we mean it when we say in our RFPs and in our contracts that companies must provide evidence that all craft labor that will be employed by the bidder on city projects  has or will have prior to commencement of the project completed at least an authorized 10 hour OSHA construction safety course. So if we can circulate the amendment, this would be adding a resolved clause.  It says, resolved, the contract shall be amended to include provisions that require the contractor to provide the names of all craft laborers who will work on the project and sufficient evidence that each of them have completed the prescribed OSHA safety training requirements prior to work commencing on the project. And that failure to provide such evidence shall constitute a breach of contract.", "start": 3484, "end": 3651, "Transition": "\"\"", "Meeting Section": "Other", "Speaker Role": "Other", "is_public_comment": 0, "is_public_hearing": 0, "is_comment_start_trigger": 0, "is_comment_end_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_start_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_end_trigger": 0}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_19", "text": "Is there a second?

I live up on the north side. I don't think I, I mean, I know I didn't ever vote for a water or stormwater increase in my four years on council. And Mr. Mayor has been here since 2014. And along with all the other changes we've seen in our community since 2014, this will put us on track.  to have a doubling of our water rates and our storm water rates by the end of the next fiscal year. So I don't know how many of you do any kind of investment or have ever heard of the rule of 72, but when you go 6, 7% every year, 10 years, you're doubled. And that's where we're at. Now, we're not producing twice as much water. We're still doing up to 19 million some gallons a day. The cost for producing that water hasn't doubled in those 10 years.  Inflation isn't running at 7%, although under the current local state and federal Democratic administrations, it certainly is pushing it this year. So why is it that we're doubling folks' water rates in less than a decade? And is there any consideration that  these constant increases in fees, fees for services and so on, that seem constant and unstoppable, aren't being considered as detrimental to our efforts to create a more affordable and equitable community. Because there's no way that you can, the city can double cost,  Add $150 million in spending to its budget, it's coming up another hearing. Double cost for water, jack up fees for every kind of service the city has to do. And say with a straight face that you're working towards equity and you care about people who live below the median income here. And I recognize that the median income here in Washtenaw County and the greater Ann Arbor area is quite high because of our relationship with the university and the fact that Ann Arbor's always been sort of a wealthy white community.  Be that as it may, there are many people in this community who struggle and I think the lineup for our assisted housing proves that. So just as you go forward with jacking up costs to live in our community, consider that there's more than one way to make it an affordable community. And one way is to not jack up costs for everybody.  The city's only responsibility, as far as I'm concerned, the number one responsibility of a municipality like the City of Ann Arbor is to provide safe, clean water. You should be looking at other places than the taxpayer's wallet for that.", "start": 4231, "end": 4411, "Transition": "\"\"", "Meeting Section": "Public Hearing", "Speaker Role": "Commenter", "is_public_comment": 0, "is_public_hearing": 1, "is_comment_start_trigger": 0, "is_comment_end_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_start_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_end_trigger": 0}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_19", "text": "Thank you.

So my house was built in 1947. And even when it was built, it was built, including the changes to code that have happened, zoning designations and height area and placement regulations that have changed since then. It was considered non-conforming.  And so when I went to put an addition on my house that didn't increase the footprint of my house in any way, but was only above the existing non-conforming footprint, I was asked to appeal their rejection of that plan by submitting an application for the Zoning Board of Appeals. Now when I called the person who administers that, and he said, I can tell by my GPS that you're about 13 to 16 inches off.  I'm looking at the historical records of your house and so on, and it's clear that you're in front of that. And every place I've ever known, any place I've ever worked, this is an administrative fix because we recognize that this happens constantly. And if you look at the ZBA records, and those of you who serve on the ZBA, you'll see that this happens constantly. People come with this, their house was out of, and they approve it. And that's what happened to me.  But on the way to that, I paid $1,000 fee for that application privilege. And I also was required to get a $1,400 stakes survey. They wouldn't accept the survey. And that I had, I had to get a new stakes survey. And that took quite a while to find someone during COVID to do that, but it was done. So $2,400 later, they went like that, which could have been done administratively. Now, I only bring that up as an example because I'm not sure people know that adding $2,400 to a very small project,  you know, could be a burden for someone. It could drag out a project. In my case, it certainly did. Should I pay a lawyer or ZBA or my architect, right? Well, when I look at the 36 pages of increases that you got coming here, including one that's real good for you, Jen, the airport unit  And we know she gave her buddy the airport contract for 30 years. Now they're going to jack up the rates he can charge. I think that's really extra special. But when I look at that 36 pages of fees that are going up between 7 and 40 percent, I certainly understand from being on that side of the table that we have to do a fair analysis of what our costs are. And we have to set the fees that way. But  If you took the time to read through this, you'd see that some of these fees are pretty astronomical and some of these changes are going to benefit people who can afford them and they're going to hurt people who can't. And so we're back to the same story again. How can we believe you when you say you want to have a community that's equitable and welcoming and affordable when you do things like this?", "start": 4510, "end": 4691, "Transition": "\"\"", "Meeting Section": "Public Hearing", "Speaker Role": "Commenter", "is_public_comment": 0, "is_public_hearing": 1, "is_comment_start_trigger": 0, "is_comment_end_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_start_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_end_trigger": 0}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_19", "text": "Thank you.

I'm Kathleen Murphy, I live at 315 Linda Vista Street in Ward 5. I thank the council for giving us the opportunity tonight to make comments about the proposed budget. I speak for the organization, Ann Arbor for Public Power.  We are in the process of trying to create a public electric utility to replace DTE because it uses mainly fossil fuels to produce its energy and thus stands in the way of allowing Ann Arbor to reach its goal of net zero carbon emissions by 2030. It also has had terribly unreliable service this past winter.  We'd like to put a placeholder, that is, Ann Arbor for Public Power, we'd like to put a placeholder in the budget of $25,000, $250,000, which would go toward the valuation of DTE's assets if the feasibility study, which the council authorized and funded, and is expected to be completed in June, looks positive.  In other words, if the feasibility study looks positive, then the next step would be to have a more precise valuation done of DTE's assets. We anticipate, after talking with cities that have undergone the creation of public electric utilities, that this would be the cost, $250,000. Since we won't know the results of the feasibility study until June,  but the budget needs to be passed in two weeks, we're asking for a placeholder in the budget to ensure that funds are available. If the feasibility study comes out to the council's liking and they want to go ahead with the valuation study, they would have then the money to do it. This is a relatively small ask in what has come to become a very large budget.  I urge you to put this placeholder in the budget so it will be possible to follow through with this plan to establish a municipal electric utility in Ann Arbor if the feasibility study shows that the process can go forward.

I am still Dr. Lauren Sargent. I still live on Ember Way in Ann Arbor and my hair is still on fire because I'm still worried about climate change. And some of you might ask, what on earth does a municipal electric utility have to do with climate change?  Well, we in Washtenaw 350 examined levers at every level where we could apply our efforts toward climate action, and we understood that we need to electrify everything and power it with renewables and efficiency. And we also concluded that the only practical usable tool is a municipal electric utility,  because right now we're stuck with DTE and they do not share our climate goals. They actively fight the just transition as the biggest lobbyist in Lansing with our money and there's nothing we can do about it short of severing that relationship.  The legislature and MPSC are de facto regulated by the investor-owned utilities, DTE, and consumers via their donations, their financial donations. Only six out of our current crop of legislators, most of them around this area, have refused to take their money. It's literally the fox guarding the hen house. And there's only one tool that can allow us to break three, free from them for electricity.  And that is legal as a municipal utility. It is legal in statute and the Michigan Constitution. And every city always has a right to its own electric franchise. Administrator DeHoney was very wise in setting aside some money in the budget for unanticipated and emergent costs.  an additional feasibility study should the original feasibility study that council already approved be positive that it looks like this would be good financial decision for the city to do it, we've got to then have the money to value the assets, to do a feasibility study to value those assets. And something that I really appreciated in hearing the budget presentation  was thinking about ways that we can put some stability and predictability into our budget. Right now, DTE gives us absolutely no control over it. One of the things that cities with municipal electric utilities enjoy is that budget stability. Holland, actually, with a nice electric municipal utility, had a problem twice within the last decade.  how to return all the extra money that they got from the revenues from customers, they had to return money because they had too much. And they also pay things to the cities in which they reside called pilot fees, payment in lieu of taxes. And also, the electric utilities borrow money for infrastructure repairs at half the rate that DTE does. It's a budget no-brainer, so please,  Save some space for step two.

He's what some people on this body, I think, like the least, which is an environmentalist who can do math.  So I found it useful to me when I read the budget every year, which I've been doing since 2012 or so, maybe even before that, to look at it in a comparative way, and also look at it in a per capita way, and also look for trends. And since I believe this is the only public hearing on the budget, which is just kind of shocking, because 2018, I had to work in the fall of 2018 with the budget that was approved before me, and 2018,  It was quite a bit smaller. I think it was 400, I wanna say 421 million, something like that. And this year it's 563, and I actually lost that bet. I thought it was gonna be 570. So that's not only is that $4,800 for every single person that lives in our community per year, it's a 442 million increase in only six years. That's quite a chunk of change.  Our mills are only going up 1.9 mills or whatever, and that's because of the various ballot initiatives that were passed.  If you look back at the 2018 thing, you can see they had placeholders in there for $627 million in alternative transportation funds, which is kind of shocking. I'm sure by the time this budget is done being itself in two years, it'll be $600 million, just the budget itself. So in 2018, we had $2.5 million in one-time requests. And this year, we have $4 million in one-time requests, $600,000. That's for studies. There's lots of funds carried forward. I thought that was kind of interesting. In this budget, the thing I see the most  We'll back it up one step. When I received my first budget cycle presentation in 2018, 2019, it was about 80 pages. And that's not the budget book, I'm talking about the presentation. And I watched yours and it was about eight. And I hate to say this, but it kind of gave me the vibe that staff's got your number.  We got 740 full-time equivalents in 2018, 840 this year. It's really something. That's where a lot of the money's going. Now there seems to be a constant quest for revenue. We're positioning ourself for long-term impact. And this constant quest for revenue fails to, two things aren't in here, one revenue and one expenditure. The one, if we're looking so hard for revenue,  How come we didn't implement the pilot program that city council said we were supposed to appoint a committee and study a pilot program and there was even anticipated amounts of revenue coming from that. But that just fell between the cracks. And the expenditure that fell between the cracks was another council resolution that passed that said there's supposed to be money in this budget for an office of the ombuds person. And that has failed to be in here too. So we have failures on both sides of this budget.

Ken Garber again. I live in the second ward. And like Ms. Murphy, Ms. Sargent, and Mr. Kyle, I'm here also to request a budget placeholder for evaluation study of DTE's assets. Should the feasibility study  lead you to decide to take the next step in the municipalization process. I should back up and say that I appreciate the tremendous amount of work that staff has put into this budget, especially Administrator DeHoney, but all down the line.  I think like Ms. Murphy said, this is a relatively small ask, a quarter million dollars, and not an actual allocation, simply a placeholder.  This, you may think, this strikes me as pretty affordable. And it is that way because Five Lakes is already doing much of the work in the ongoing feasibility study. Also, a lot of the infrastructure is open to visual inspection. And as a regulated utility, DTE has submitted a lot of information already to the state on asset condition and depreciation. So the system is not a black box.  As I was sitting there, I remembered something I did read in the budget documents. It's a minor point, but DTE, if I'm remembering right, is raising our street light energy rates by 14% this year, or $300,000, and an additional double-digit increase next fiscal year, FY25.  So this is more than we're asking just for this placeholder. I'm confident that a muni can deliver electricity at least as affordably as DTE and as the previous speakers have said, has the potential to acquire electricity on the wholesale market that's 100% renewable.  So I realize this is a controversial topic, but I think this is a very minor and prudent step that you can take tonight, actually not tonight, but in the next two weeks as you complete the budget, to make an allowance for this possibility.

I live in the 5th Ward. I am happy to see the West Park Bandshell in the budget. I hope the bandshell will be repaired and re-situated so it will serve its purpose and be used for concerts in the park once again. It's a matter of honoring our city's history.  I'm surprised that the city plans to spend a lot of money to make Fuller Park into so-called Bicentennial Park. The city has said over and over that it has no money for more parks, and yet there seems to be plenty of money for this. Also, I have learned from Susan Weinberg, an Ann Arbor historian, that Fuller Park was indeed named for the Fuller family and not merely for the road.  So I feel the name should not be changed. Again, it's a matter of honoring our city's history, especially in this bicentennial year. I notice there is absolutely no money for the center of the city in the budget, although city residents mandated the center of the city when we passed Proposal A.  On the other hand, there is money for the tree line trail, which was not voted on by city residents at all. I urge you to put money in the budget to clean up the toxins at 415 West Washington Street.  This is city property, and the city has known about these taxons for years and has done nothing. And now we know that these taxons are spreading. The city wants to wait years until a developer comes forward, submits all the necessary plans and gets all the necessary approval, and only then cleans it up. We can't wait that long.  And the city would end up paying for the cleanup anyway by a waived taxes. Those are our taxes. I would hope the city would value the health of its residents, the taxpayers, and would clean it up now. Lastly, I'm sorry that the Klein lot is no longer being viewed as a site for affordable housing, but rather for market rate housing.  Quoting City Administrator Jehome, he said, quote, now, admittedly, the use of the line for market rate. 30 seconds. Affordable may get me uninvited to a Thanksgiving dinner table. Yes, indeed. What happened? I thought it was all about affordable housing, but now it's market rate.  I really am looking forward to a long discussion on this budget, and I hope that the budget will be changed for the better before it is approved at your next meeting. Thank you.

So yeah, I got I got three comments. One is the I like the idea of the the downtown safety patrols involving an empty and a.  and someone from Supportive Connections, that's a great idea. I do not like the idea of police being involved in this also. If we want these safety patrols to be going around and helping people, it's going to be hard to find people, it's going to be hard to  make people feel safe enough to be honest about the kind of help that they need if there's a police officer around. And even if the police say, oh, we're not here to arrest people or something like that when they're part of these patrols, that message will not be heard by the people on the street who they're talking to.  And so it'll definitely inhibit people finding the right kind of help.  There's point number two. I saw that this budget increases the police budget by 1.75 FTE. And I don't know if that's because of the downtown safety patrols or not. But either way, I would like for us not to be increasing the police budget. I think that we'll see when we start implementing  when we start implementing the unarmed response program, that the need for police officers will drop by quite a bit, because the unarmed response will be doing a lot of the work that police used to do. And so I'd rather see some of the money, instead of being spent on police, spent on that.  And finally, we have $1 million of unallocated budget money from marijuana taxes, and I would like to advocate for that to go towards reparations. The city has  throughout its history and up to the present, had policies that have prevented black families from building wealth, from building generational wealth. And meanwhile, white families have had opportunities to build wealth that black families have not. And that's not just some inevitable forces of history that caused that to happen. It was decisions.  that were made by the city council. And so we should take that million dollars and put it towards reparations like they do in Evanston, Illinois.

My name is Greg Woodring. I am the president of Ann Arbor Public Power. I live at 1012 West Crop. I'm calling in once again to advocate for the $250,000 budget placeholder for the valuation study of a municipal utility. As many of the other callers said, this is simply the next step in a process that the city has already begun.  If the feasibility study is positive, and it indicates that this would be a direction that would be financially beneficial for the city to pursue, then the next step in the process is to get a hard valuation on what the cost of DTE's assets would be, which would allow the city to then make an offer to DTE. It would help in any future legal fights over valuation. And it's just a prudent step in pursuing this process.  If we did not put this placeholder in the budget and then the results were positive, it would simply mean that we need to take the money from somewhere else in the budget rather than, and that would simply just be messy. It would be, it could be good. It would be poor governance. We hope that this is not a too controversial of a position to ask for. It seems like simply the,  It's a prudent thing to do, considering that we have this study coming out next month, and we don't know the results yet, but we know that the next step, if they're positive, would be to spend this money. When you look across the state of Michigan, across the country, you see that municipal utilities have cheaper rates, they have better reliability, and they have the ability to choose where their power comes from. With the city of Ann Arbor's climate goals, it is unrealistic to expect that we are going to be able to reach them,  with DTE as our primary power provider. Municipalization simply seems like the only realistic option to pursue the city's climate goals while having the added benefit of increasing its reliability and over time lowering its cost.

My name is Kathy Boris. I live at 1726 Charlton in the 5th Ward. Bundled into this year's city budget is this year's capital improvement plan, the CIP. And one of the items included in the CIP is the extension of a runway at the Ann Arbor City Airport.  Our A20 plan boasts a goal of carbon neutrality by the year 2030 and a strategy that focuses on reducing the miles we travel in our vehicles, regardless of type, by at least 50%. Having those two goals, it is ironic that an extension of the airport runway could be considered for inclusion in the CIP. Yes, the Ann Arbor Airport has a long and interesting history.  Yes, it provides many benefits to Ann Arbor and the surrounding area, but that does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that extending a runway by 720 feet will be better for the community than the current configuration of the airport. This is because a longer runway is sure to enable use by larger jets and more jet traffic.  Here's what the mayor says in his letter of welcome on page 5 of the H2O plan. Quote, every person, every homeowner, renter, student, visitor, community member, business owner, worker, youth, and elected leader has a significant role to play in achieving community-wide carbon neutrality, end quote. When the mayor says every person, I believe that every person  must include those who travel to and from Ann Arbor by private or corporate jet. If that is not the case, if only persons of lesser financial means than jet travelers are asked to make sacrifices, then that certainly flies in the face of the admirable goals of the H-0 plan. Some have claimed that the runway should be extended for reasons of safety.  But no clear danger from the current configuration of the runways has been demonstrated. Others say they suspect that the true purpose of the proposed runway extension is to allow more and larger jets into Ann Arbor's airport at a time when we are fully aware of how highly polluting these jets are. While the extension of the runway would bring jobs, union jobs, so would the other items on the CIP.  The CIP is a list of proposed capital improvements after all. I hope City Council will consider removing the proposed Ann Arbor Airport runway extension from the CIP so that projects of much broader community benefit can be moved forward instead. Because an extended airport runway will benefit only the very wealthy.

Thus far, after eliminating your work sessions and related public comment,  It looks like you haven't asked a single question, which I find very surprising. Let me ask a couple. The first one might be somewhere in here, but I didn't see the answer. Are we going to be using the climate millage to pay for any of the new sustainability FTEs? Next, how about an explanation of the statement on page 29? There it says we had 685 FTEs in 2013, 10 years ago.  to propose 829 in 2024, 144 more people. That's an increase of 21%. Then it says, in general, the city government has become a more efficient organization. Really? Better maybe, doing more maybe, but more efficient? Come on, that's a serious stretch. This budget adds 27,  The city administrator has gone from 3 in 2021 to 5 now, to 8 next year. What are those two additional people already at it doing? What are the next three going to do? Sustainability is at a 9. GPA is 143. I don't know why the budget uses a different number other places. The Housing Commission has gone from 30 in 2021 to 43 now, 47 next year, 52 in 2025. Should people be asking what are they going to be doing?  The city administrator said we need to pay more to be competitive, so 3% up to all non-union employees. That, I think, has a point. But with all these new hires, you're talking $3 million before the salary bumps even happen. How are we going to afford all this?  Just a few extra questions from the report. The human resources goes from 2.3 million last year to 2.7 next year. Finance, 4 million in 2021 to 4.8 next year. District court, 1.2 million 2022 to 1.5 next year. As they say, a few million here and there, you add up to real money. I think we really need to look at some of the  the efficiencies that could be made here.

I also noted that there was no particular line in the budget to represent a development in the center of the city.  and particularly the center of the city as a community commons as the people did vote. And I was very impressed with the notion that the public power people put anticipating a positive development in these ideas that there should be a placeholder in the budget. And I hope that there could be a placeholder in the development of the center of the city.  particularly as public and private money raised to have a feasibility design, planning study done to help us figure out just what is desirable. While I'm not so enthusiastic about outsourcing creativity, I think it would be desirable to be an opportunity for  people to anticipate the outcome of this feasibility and planning study is actually having a programmatic support of some sort agreeing to be matched. One aspect for the placeholder  would be some education for the city council members and the general public as to what is the commons, commonly pooled resources self-managed by the users. This is an idea that is not new. It's as old as history. And the Nobel Prize in economics, as I think I quote, was given to the research that put together thousands of studies all over the world.  as to how when public resources and commonly pooled resources, and public and private and what people give of their money and land and talent and so on, are managed by the users rather than either by the government or by some private corporation, the resources are better used. So that's why it's important to see some education for the council people and for the general public as to what is the cause.  So I hope that you will see a...  a placeholder for the development of the commons and also to actually put some staff time on self-education about what are these ideas that are developing all over the world is a new frame of urbanism that has allowed public participation much more and mutually, which we greatly need.

My name is Gus Teschke and I live at 313 Montgomery. First, I'd like to thank city council for funding the phase one feasibility study for a full public electric utility.  This utility would completely replace DTE and provide 100% reliable renewable power for all residents in Antarctica. And we need the results of this study to decide whether to move forward. The report will be ready in June, and I think the odds are good that it will show that a public electric utility is feasible. Second, I urge City Council to create a $250,000 budgetary placeholder for a valuation study  for this old public electric utility, because it puts a price on DPE's electric lines in Ann Arbor in preparation to buying. The valuation study is the next step in the process. It's also called a Phase II feasibility study. Since the Phase I feasibility study will not be done until next month, but you're passing your budget this month, it would be easier just to create this $250,000 placeholder now and avoid scrambling for money later.  Okay, third, I'd like to say that DTE's power in my area on the west side was out for three days in the February ice storm when my house went down to 46 degrees before power was restored. It was an amazingly stressful and avoidable experience. About 80,000 Ann Arbor residents lost power in that storm, in the winter, in the bitter cold, and many for five days or more. In my view, the danger, the damage, the cost, and the stress caused by  DTE's unreliable electric service disqualifies that corporation from providing power to Ann Arbor. We require a dependable electric service, and luckily the state constitution gives us that option to have a public electric utility that completely replaces DTE.  I look forward to that. I want DTE out of here. Please create a $250,000 budget placeholder so that we can take the next step in creating a public electric utility.

There's about 20 of them. They are all distribution system focused, so mostly water main projects. There's also some valve replacements in the distribution system.  It's typical and best practice for us to use bonds to pay for future capital projects needs like this. And the reason is that that's best practice is because  the benefits of these investments are realized by future water customers. And through the bonding process, as we pay the bonds back through our water rates, future customers are paying for that additional infrastructure. So that's typical in best practices and the reason why we use issuing debt to cover those types of projects.  We also have other tools in our toolbox besides just issuing our own by issuing bonds by the city, but we look at grant programs. We've been successful recently. In fact, we just recently was awarded one from the state of Michigan to help do some work with the water treatment plant.  address associated with our filters. We also use revolving and loan fund programs we've been successful in achieving or getting funds from recently from the state of Michigan. And we'll continue to pursue those types of options that will be available to us when we see projects that fit and we think will score well. The projects that we've identified for this water revenue bond  again, which are typically water main projects, typically do not score well through the state's ranking system. So we tend not to submit these types of projects for that type of funding. But when we're doing projects that have a larger benefit for the whole water system, those will score better through the state's ranking system and those we will continue to put through in order to get preferred  the preferred rates that are associated with the state's program. The bonds are, one other question that was raised by one of the council members was how the bonds paid back, and they are paid back through future waterways. I think I mentioned that already. The other portion of utilizing bonds is it helps us meet also our financial metrics with utility.  So we are looking at things like debt coverage ratios to make sure we can meet those in order to make sure we can maintain the bond ratings that we want so we can get good rates when we go to market. So we factor in these financial metrics also into the decisions on how much to bond for and when to also go out to the market to bond.  I guess the last thing I'll add, and Kate can open it up and see if there's any other questions, is that we did also just put out in our monthly newsletter, which is the Ann Arbor Water Newsletter, a description that you can share about the bond and the anticipated use and how we will fund it at the request of one of the council members also, so that can be shared with constituents.", "start": 7606, "end": 7809, "Transition": "\"\"", "Meeting Section": "Other", "Speaker Role": "Other", "is_public_comment": 0, "is_public_hearing": 0, "is_comment_start_trigger": 0, "is_comment_end_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_start_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_end_trigger": 0}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_19", "text": "Thank you.

There are no members other than Councilmembers on it, and initially, it filled a gap.  Council established the Brownfield Plan Review Committee when agreements were negotiated project by project, which is to say that standard policy guidelines had not yet been specified. So the committee served the function of making those guidelines up as it went along.  they negotiated brownfield agreements and then sent them along to city council for approval. Since 2019, when council adopted a policy that prescribed standards guiding these brownfield tax incentive agreements, there was no longer a gap for the review committee to fill. We had actually told ourselves how to do that work. And so the review committee was essentially  part of the council being instructed by the whole council on what to do to give to the whole council to approve. You see my point. There's a little redundancy, if not a little bit of schizophrenia there. So no, I shouldn't be light about that. So anyway, the policy specifies the environmental and non-environmental activities that are and are not eligible for reimbursement.  Codified rules, such as we enacted in 2019, play an important part in oversight because they provide consistent common standards that any reviewing body and the public must use in evaluating brownfield agreements. Dissolving the review committee makes no reduction or limitation of council oversight. There is no punting or shirking of responsibility.  The review committee has never been the committee of final review. It is now and will remain the responsibility of City Council to review brownfield agreements for projects within the City of Ann Arbor and deny or approve them. Council as a body will now act, as Councilmember Iyer explained earlier, with the benefit of a presentation from the developer.  Any plan approved by City Council will proceed to the county for final approval. Nothing is being ceded to the county. The county is now and will remain in the role of the Washtenaw County Board of Commissioners to give final approval  to any brownfield plan that comes before it. And what's more, the Board of Commissioners always convenes a public hearing for every brownfield plan agreement in the county and provides notice to every taxing jurisdiction. So whether the review committee is dissolved or not, all affected jurisdictions will be noticed and will have an opportunity to evaluate and comment on every county brownfield agreement.  If we dissolve the review committee, we will eliminate one thing only, which is the inefficient use of a precious resource, and I am talking about the time and effort of our planning staff and development team.", "start": 8012, "end": 8206, "Transition": "\"\"", "Meeting Section": "Other", "Speaker Role": "Other", "is_public_comment": 0, "is_public_hearing": 0, "is_comment_start_trigger": 0, "is_comment_end_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_start_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_end_trigger": 0}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_11", "text": "Move my microphone, I'm so fired up about this. Just to clear up some, I think, misinformation that's been shared. The Michigan Strategic Fund's Brownfield Program uses tax incremental financing to reimburse brownfield related costs that are incurred when developing contaminated, functionally obsolete, blighted, historic, or other, here's the key word, eligible properties.  By increasing the taxable value of the properties, the Brownfield program generates increased tax revenue and has a positive significant impact on the taxable values of surrounding properties. I think a couple of really important things to note is that the incentive amount is not guaranteed. It is only realized if the investment achieves the anticipated increase in property value. So the cause and effect need to match in order for that incentive to be awarded.  The developer must pay for the improvements to the site, and then property taxes must be paid each year. This is not a handout. Once the Brownfield plan reimbursement is complete, the increased property taxes that would not exist without the redevelopment taking place begin going directly to all of the taxing jurisdictions, city, county, and state.  TIF programs are really common in economic development. We have other examples of TIF tax incremental financing being used here in the city of Ann Arbor. And in every single case where TIF dollars are applied, there are very clear parameters around what a qualifying project is, clear methods to evaluate the success of a project in order for those dollars to be awarded.  This is important. There's no ambiguity when it comes to awarding TIF dollars, regardless of the program from which those dollars are granted. There's also no ambiguity around the Brownfield TIF being an important economic development tool that's not unique to Ann Arbor, Michigan, or the country.  It's really common. What isn't common is to suggest that there's something irresponsible, untoward, shortsighted, uninformed about this move by city council. Quite candidly, it feels like conspiracy theory fodder around a program that is literally designed to provide significant economic benefit to the city.  Any brownfield project that the city would take on still requires city council approval. That can't be stated more. To suggest dissolving this committee removes oversight from the process is dishonest at worst. And at best, it shows a complete and fundamental lack of knowledge around the process itself.

And whereas from 2010 and 2020, the APIA population increased in 70% of Michigan counties, with Washtenaw County having one of the highest concentrations of growth amidst one of the already largest members of APIA residents in the state. And whereas the 2020 census data reveals that APIA residents are the second largest racial group in Ann Arbor,  And whereas the APIA community expanded upon solidarity civil rights work with allies who share histories with black, indigenous, and people of color. And in the aftermath of the 1988 murder of Vincent Chin in Detroit, becoming the first federal hate crime litigated in an APIA victim. Whereas anti-APIA sentiment has increased exponentially in recent years.  and the Ann Arbor City Council has condemned hate crimes, hateful rhetoric, and hateful acts against Asian and Asian Americans in April 22. And whereas despite ongoing challenges, APIA community leaders in Ann Arbor, some of whom were arrayed here, others of whom we had the pleasure of being joined by at City Council, in Ann Arbor have committed to community well-being, health, and justice for all throughout their personal and professional work.

Thank you. Hi, everybody. My name's Derek Miller, resident of Ward 4 and executive director of Community Action Network. I'm here today to advocate for the inclusive and transformative celebration of Ann Arbor's bicentennial.  As we commemorate two centuries of growth, progress, and community spirit, I urge you to consider the Southeast Area Park as a perfect location for a thrilling and much-needed splash zone or other park amenities. As stated in the resolution to direct the City Administrator to designate Southeast Area Park as the 2024 Bicentennial Park. Why Southeast Area Park? It is a beacon of opportunity for the residents of Southeast Ann Arbor, the largest concentration of low-income individuals in our city.  This community deserves not only commemoration, but tangible investments that uplift their lives. By choosing Southeast Area Park as specified in the resolution, we have the chance to create an accessible and empowering space for families, children, and individuals who may have limited recreational options. Moreover, the presence of Community Action Network, also known as CAN, in this area further highlights the significance of Southeast Area Park. CAN serves three under-resourced neighborhoods in this area, and these communities would directly benefit from the creation of this park and its amenities.  Ken has expressed his commitment to coordinating visits to this amazing amenity, ensuring that children and families who face economic barriers can experience the joy and respite it offers. But let us not forget that there is also still an incredible need for human services support in this area. Just today, Ken's largest food distribution at Bryan Community Center ran out midday and will not be replenished until Wednesday. Sadly, this has become a common occurrence by designating Southeast Area Park as the 2024 Bicentennial Park  We have the opportunity to address not only the need for recreational spaces, but also urgent need for vital services. We can send a powerful message to our community that our community stands united in supporting our most vulnerable residents. Moreover, Southeast Area Park's strategic location near multiple neighborhoods and various busing options ensures that families from different parts of the city can access the water park with ease.  Transportation should never be a barrier to enjoyment, and by selecting this part, as outlined in the resolution, we make a bold statement of our commitment to equitable access for all residents, regardless of their socioeconomic circumstances. Let us seize this occasion, the bicentennial celebration, to make a lasting impact on our community. I implore you to consider the long-lasting benefits, the positive impact on marginalized populations, and the opportunity to foster a sense of unity that transcends socioeconomic context. As outlined in the resolution,  to choose Southeast Area Park as the home for the Bicentennial Park and let us celebrate our history by creating a future that is truly inclusive, vibrant, and accessible to all.

Okay. Sorry about that. This is Kitty Kahn. I live in the fifth floor. I'm calling about something that I heard City Administrator DeHoney say at the May 9th meeting of the Ann Arbor Council Administration Committee.  This is a meeting that was broadcast audio only. It was not on Zoom, nor was it televised. Mr. DeHoney spoke about his plan for the city to build market rate housing next to City Hall. He had mentioned this when he gave his budget presentation to City Council about a month ago, but he went into more detail on May 9th. Now, I'm going to quote Mr. DeHoney. He said, quote,  Assuming that we get past the budget on Monday and Council doesn't say don't do it. Starting May 16th, I'm off.\" Then, Mr. DeHoney clarified exactly what the proposed development would look like.  Quoting Mr. De Coney again, he said, quote, it's high end, market rate, high level finishes. You want to charge as much as possible. You want this thing to generate as much cash as possible. That's why I did not say let's use it for affordable housing, unquote. Let me repeat what he said because it shocked me when I heard it. He said, and listen carefully,  It's high end, market rate, high level finishes. You want to charge as much as possible. You want this thing to generate as much cash as possible. That's why I did not say let's use it for affordable housing, unquote.  I'd like to hear more about Mr. DeHoney's plan, and I want him to explain how this fits into our city's need for affordable and workforce housing. We have a lot of high-end market-rate housing in our city already. Do we really want our tax dollars to pay for even more of that? I know I don't. What about you? Mr. DeHoney says his plan is a way for the city to raise money. He wants to put the same high-end housing on the Klein lot.  But I've seen the city play developer before, and we end up losing money on that scheme. Maybe Mr. Gahoney doesn't know about that. Somebody should fill him in. I think probably a lot of the new council members, probably everybody on council now doesn't know about when the city tried to play developer before, but it didn't end up well.  Instead, why don't we try to live within our means and realign our priorities? For example, Council Chambers was redone just seven years ago. Does it need to be redone again now with a mural on the ceiling, really? This is only one example. I'm sure we could find many more.

In just the last week, you saw on the news Israel blowing down whole buildings, blowing down homes, murdering children in their beds while they slept. You saw all that on your TV news. This is what Israel does with your military aid, with your tax dollars, with your $3.8 billion every year. And the mayor here,  The mayor here has the balls to pretend that he's for minorities, he's for Asian-Americans. That's bullshit. What happened to Vincent Chin, where he was murdered with impunity, happens every day in occupied Palestine, paid for by your tax dollars.  So don't pretend that you are against that kind of violence that happened to Vincent Chin because Israel has created thousands of Vincent Chins with even more impunity than the killers of Vincent got. Even more impunity.  You, the Ann Arbor City Council, have thrown all your weight against every single resolution that tries to object  to the mountain of military aid that you give to Israel, even when that resolution came from your own Ann Arbor Human Rights Commission, even then, you threw your weight against all those Palestinian human rights resolutions. So don't even try to pretend you're against racism.  You are committing racist crimes against the Palestinian people every single time you turn your back and throw your weight against Palestinian rights resolutions. That's why I believe this city council is racist to the bone. Tonight you'll hear weeping and wailing about the Black Lives Matter yellow paint in the park.

This city has been gentrified.  30 years ago, this town had a vibrant black community. Today, that black community does not exist. They've been squeezed out. In fact, the old west side was wall-to-wall African-American black families. Today, you barely find any black people there. So when they tell you they love blacks and they love Black Lives Matter movement, they're lying. Another case.  University of Michigan, 50 years ago, promised 10% black enrollment. To this day, that has not happened. To this day, no one on this council or any other council has pushed University of Michigan to do good on their promise 50 years ago. In fact, University of Michigan is one of the most atrocious  when it comes to black enrollment. It is the lowest anywhere in the United States. University of Michigan promised 10% black enrollment.

She is absolutely correct. Second, I want to thank council members Garzi Edwin, Regina, Harrison, Watson, and Dish for sponsoring the resolution to designate Southeast Area Park as the 2024 Bicentennial Park. This park is both well used and very undervalued by the city, and I hope that we can change  Next, I'd like to ask the city to modify the fiscal year 2024 budget. First, we need to redirect some of that police budget to unarmed response. There's a $1.75 FTE increase for the police. Let's give that to unarmed response instead. Additionally, there's $800,000 on the budget for a replacement fire engine. This is great.  But I think that we should direct the fire department to purchase a much smaller fire truck, like we're starting to see in cities like San Francisco and London and Tokyo.  The current ones that we've got are massively oversized and do not fit on properly human scale streets, which just forces more impermeable surface in a new development, just because the only fire trucks that are available are these monstrosities.  And finally, I want to talk about the PUD on South Forest. I hope that this passes, but the fact that this has to be a PUD shows that our zoning is not working. This should not be a PUD.

Just briefly, I'm on the agenda to speak about the enactment of Resolution R-22-363. Six months ago, this body and five people who are sitting here tonight voted in favor of a resolution directing our city administrator to investigate the establishment and funding of an office of the ombudsperson for the city of Ann Arbor, which I think would take care of a lot of the concerns that people have, the community have, about the poor customer service here at City Hall. And that's not me making something up. It's in your reports if you read them.  And that resolution that was passed by the body resolved that the city administrator report back these findings at a regular council meeting prior to the finalization of the budget, which is tonight. And that didn't happen as far as I know. I didn't see anything about that. And I don't see a place where we're in the budget. Now we had, I know there's potentially like some short memories on here, but one effort of this body should be to see what the previous body had to do. And there should be some effort at continuity, especially when it's something that's for the good of the whole community.  So, you know, we'll write it off to short memories and hope that you have this opportunity to change and get that forward tonight. Otherwise, we're going to write it off to the considerations that maybe this body isn't trustworthy. Now, I got a chuckle when I heard the mayor stand up here and say that he stands for constant expressions of pluralism. And when I spoke at our last meeting, I was not unfortunately interrupted by these good advocates behind me to speak  about no US military aid to Israel. And I do not support military aid to Israel. And I would call for it myself. And I do not support military aid to any country. And the United States has been handing out $12 billion or so every year for the last decade that we know about in direct purchases or funneled through third parties. And essentially what the United States does with this money, Israel or any other country, is prop up the small arms industries.  And so when I go downtown and I see the moms demand action against firearms down there, and I say moms should be demanding action against all military aid anywhere, because all that is doing is propping up our small arms industries. We sent billions and billions of rounds of ammunition, millions of rounds of ammunition, everything, all over the world. It's disgusting. And that's just what we know about. That's the overt operations. So that this body can't come forward and make a general statement against war. If you're not working for peace, if one isn't working for peace, what are we working for here?  It's the basis of everything. And on this day, on May 15th, it's especially so. And so I want to apologize to the Palestinian community for not taking my opportunity when I sat at that table to bring forward a resolution. But as these folks have been pointing out for some years, you can see what I would have been up against there. So I doubt that it would have even been discussed. Now I got to comment on something. We got a big call to defund the police. The average police department has 2.4 people for every 1,000 residents. We have one.  2.4 officers, we have one officer for every 1000 residents. This city only has 97 police officers. Okay. They're complaining about the state, the police state. Yes, state power is a danger. Well, then no more military aid to Israel or anybody else. Get rid of the state power. If you want to defund the police, get the arms out of our community and out of the world.", "start": 2147.218, "end": 2334.881, "Transition": "\"\"", "Meeting Section": "Public Comment", "Speaker Role": "Commenter", "is_public_comment": 1, "is_public_hearing": 0, "is_comment_start_trigger": 0, "is_comment_end_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_start_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_end_trigger": 0}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_11", "text": "Thank you.

Thank you. This is Tom Stahlberg. I'm calling from Lower Town in Ann Arbor. And I'd like to wear some different hats tonight, as I often do. As a landlord, I'd like to talk about E4, the Renter's Commission's recommendation.  Support your renters. They're the lower power people in the equation between renters and landlords. Some landlords have found workarounds. I guess the new laws for protecting renters are going to need some iterations, so please pay attention to the Renter's Commission and the recommendations as far as wait lists and other workarounds. Also, the Renter's Commission, I'll speak on E2 and E4 both, because the Renter's Commission  has advocated for sustainability, as has the Environmental Commission and the Energy Commission, and they all have resolutions before you dealing with natural gas for both heating and for appliances. And I'm sure you've read the details of those various resolutions. Whatever we do, we must do something more than what we are currently doing. And we must do so promptly. As they ask of you, please treat this  with the great urgency fitting a declared emergency. And as they ask, please, with equal urgency, implement carrot and stick measures to promote sustainable construction. As a landlord and property owner of multiple smaller properties, not any large projects, we're trying to implement various things and learning as we go. I just read another article today that talked about ways  that can overcome some of the hurdles we've been facing in our investigations on how to implement air source heat pumps into our properties. We're doing what we can, and I know a lot of people are doing what they can, and citizens are doing what they can, and citizen groups are doing what they can to educate ourselves and to improve what we have in terms of our existing housing stock. It is essential for our new housing stock to not  put us into a hole that we cannot fall out of if we're going to meet our 820 goals by 2030. So please, listen to those resolutions. Also, on C1, I'll put on my developer's hat. C1 is the 721 South Forest PUD re-zoning. Staff recommends that the PUD zoning district be denied because it's not consistent with the comprehensive land use plan. The proper process would be  Revise the plan for that area. You don't have to go to that area prior to considering a zone, something that doesn't and you need to do it for the area, not for an individual property. 1 property at a time. I know my time is short. I've experienced that as a developer. I had a good project. It didn't meet the comprehensive plan. I waited for the community.  a revised or comprehensive plan, and only then did they grant me the zoning. They did. They liked the project. The community liked the project. It works for everybody.

I'm here to ask you to approve C1, also known as the 721 South Forest PUD. If constructed, this will replace a 50-unit run-down apartment building and parking lot with a development that has 733 bedrooms, a couple hundred bike parking spots, and even some retail.  It's an all-electric building, just like we've been requesting from developers, and will provide $4.7 million to the Affordable Housing Fund. Despite being less than a block from other dense housing near campus, and advancing Council's stated goals of building environmentally friendly mixed-use developments to help alleviate the housing crisis, the staff report recommended against approval, and planning was split 6-2, but in favor.  I attended the meeting and read the documents, and the objections seemed to be that the project wouldn't be appropriate for the area by the letter of existing council policy. Maybe that's true, but it feels like it fits to me. On a recent bike ride through the area, I stopped in front of the parking area of the existing building, and I can see a number of taller buildings without really even having to squint.  A seven-story parking structure is basically across the street, and there are similar tall buildings another half a block away. The building would fit in the area just fine. I hope council approves this PUD today, but if you do, this tells me that there is a mismatch between what council and staff and planning believes is our policy on building dense housing close to downtown and campus.  Every time there's a mismatch like this, I think it's worth examining if there are simple policy changes we can make before doing the entire comprehensive plan to set reasonable expectations for these sorts of projects. I don't know what that would look like in detail, but I hope that there's something short term we can do akin to a quick build transportation project that doesn't require years of process to implement. Doing these as one-off PODs is pretty inefficient. There's got to be a better way. Please set some kind of policy.  so that we get what we want and we need.

Yes, tomorrow, unless someone on city council makes a motion to amend the budget.  I have many questions about this project proposed by the city administrator, probably other members of the public do too. But my most nagging question is this. What are the ethics of building city-owned luxury housing as a source of city revenue in a city that so badly needs affordable housing?

I'd like to express my support for amendments two and three of DS-3. These amendments will allow us to better support some of our most vulnerable neighbors in our local community. These resources are especially important considering we're seeing both increases in both acuity and the number of people seeking services over the past year.  This past winter alone, we saw an increase of almost 20% of those seeking overnight shelter, and now almost 70% of our guests we serve have a disability, more often than not being a serious chronic health condition, with many coming out of the hospital or other settings. These amendments allow us to target additional resources to returning citizens and those impacted by the criminal justice system, helping address systemic barriers and the impact of systemic racism.  I appreciate that these amendments highlight utilizing a trauma-informed lens as well, giving special attention to the incredibly challenging circumstances our guests go through every day, and the importance of bringing an empathetic and client-centered approach that focuses on addressing that trauma. I do want to point out one specific item in Amendment 3, recommending that the service population be expanded to not just those who already have a tenant-based voucher, but also to provide support for those returning citizens with seeking  obtaining and identifying a tenant-based voucher. That would broaden the service array, and I think the voucher process is really hard to navigate, so providing additional support on the front end would be a huge boon. I want to give a special thank you to Councilmembers Briggs and Harrison for reaching out recently over the last few weeks to explore ways to better serve some of our most vulnerable neighbors, and thank the entire Council for bringing these amendments forward to support  some of our most vulnerable neighbors here in our community.

It aims to draw attention to systemic racism, violence, and inequality that disproportionately affect the black community. By defacing this message with All Lives Matter, the focus on the specific struggles of black people is undermined and dismissed.  Such an altercation not only fails to acknowledge the historical and ongoing oppression experienced by black individuals, but also perpetuates a harmful narrative that dilutes the urgent need for change. It dismisses the need for targeted efforts to address racial injustices and sidetracks conversations about the specific challenges faced by marginalized communities.  The defacing of Black Lives Matter with all lives matter disregards the systemic issues that persist and contributes to the erasure of the experiences, voices, and demands of the black community. It perpetuates a narrative that disregards the deep-rooted structural inequalities and reinforces the status quo.  It is crucial to recognize the harms and trauma caused by defacing black lives matter with all lives matter, and to engage in conversations that address the specific issues faced by black individuals.

Centuries of government and culturally enforced white supremacy has resulted in America where black community members are vulnerable to violence and discrimination. And our community's declaration that black lives matter is in part our expression that this vulnerability is not acceptable and that black community members here in Ann Arbor and everywhere  have the right to live free from fear, and that we in Ann Arbor are committed to being part of that solution, and that these expressions of hate that we see in the parks will not stop the anti-racist change that we as a council and community are committed to effect.

So this site at 721 South Forest currently contains one five-story, 50-unit apartment building with 76 surface parking spaces. Approval of this ordinance will rezone the property from R4C to PUD, planned unit development, and will permit a 166-foot tall structure containing 228 residential units and 733 bedrooms.  The proposed structure exceeds the maximum height in the current zoning district by 135 feet. The units provided will be a mix of studio and one to six bedroom units. The zoning also allows a small retail space of less than 5,000 square feet.  As mentioned previously, the planning staff recommendation was no, and the Planning Commission voted 6 for and 2 against. That vote warrants consideration of the public benefits and relationship of the building to the surrounding context, but this is first reading, and I don't intend to launch a debate on the details. I just want to give you a quick overview of the features.  The PUD provides numerous sustainability elements. The building will be all electric. There will be no gas hookups except for backup gas generator. The building will be LEED silver. The developer will purchase renewable energy certificates that will offset 100% of the building's energy consumption for 10 years. Rooftop solar panels will provide 3% of what the building will use for energy.  The building observes and will be required to observe key tenets of passive house principles, such as to double the average of continuous insulation and utilize other measures to minimize heat loss. There will be just 98 vehicles parking spaces provided on site, two EV charging stations installed in the surface spaces, and 24 in the garage, which is two times what's required. There will be ground floor storage for 62 bicycles and an additional 135  Bicycle parking spaces provided in an enclosed area in the lower level parking garage. There are significant affordability elements. PUD regulations require a minimum of 15% of the total units be dedicated as affordable or a contribution in lieu of units. The petitioner has chosen to provide a cash-in-lieu payment of $4.7 million, which is $98,000 over the required amount.  In addition to that required contribution, plus some, to the city's affordable housing fund, the project will also make a voluntary contribution of $50,000 to the Ann Arbor Housing Development Corporation to be used for sustainability upgrades to existing or proposed Ann Arbor Housing Development Corporation properties located in the central area of the city.  The debate on the Planning Commission focused first on why this property should be a PUD. This is always justified by unique features of the site, and this site has a unique feature in that it is next door to an urban forest fragment. The developer has done a shade study and designed their massing to protect that fragment. That's written into the supplemental regulations. Council Member?

Obviously, it's not very often that we have a recommendation of denial by planning by our staff, and I think we need to go into debating why.  If this project truly has Has a community benefits that it needs to pass muster So just to read a little bit from the report in case you haven't had a chance to peruse it yet a site plan and rezoning of the parcel from our foresee to PUD rezoning is not supported by city planning's staff  And it doesn't support the project as presented for a few reasons, but one, the size of the structure, but also the fact that it can't be essentially, there isn't an opportunity to scale down the project as  would be appropriate as you are leaving a D1 or D2 district. What is I think perhaps most notable for me as we talk about the sustainability elements in this project is that OSI staff also does not support the approval of this project. And it notes that while the LEED silver certification is welcome,  LEED does not inherently meet the strategy goals of the A20 plan and in some instances falls short of what is needed to move Ann Arbor successfully toward carbon neutrality by 2030. The OSI will not recommend approval of this project if it did not meet net zero energy performance standards.

As a student, I lived in U Towers at the corner of South University and South Forest back in my sophomore year, which was 2005 and 2006. At the time, I remember that building, which was constructed in 1965, was the only tall, densely populated, student-focused housing in that area. And if I wanted to live within walking distance of campus and downtown, my options were fairly limited.  A full year before I moved in, in 2004, almost 20 years ago now, the South University Area Association had already recognized a need for more housing and more growth in this area and had submitted a proposal to do just that. It still took another five years to adopt the A2D2 rezoning, which began to reshape South University's corridor and bring much needed housing growth to the area.  And now, here we are in 2023, still talking about the need for more housing in close proximity to campus and to South University. Housing that we desperately need to help alleviate our ongoing housing crisis, and the housing that will help to keep students within walking distance of their classes, downtown, and public transit that will allow them to attend the university without reliance on a car.  Finally, when I was out on the campaign trail, specifically in the North Burns Park area, I heard from long-term residents about their concerns with housing availability in the area due to more and more houses being gobbled up by landlords to use as short-term student rentals, driving up housing costs and impacting the long-term upkeep and quality of those structures.  This problem exists exactly because we as a city, and yes, the university, which needs to own this problem as well, has not kept up with the need for more student-focused housing immediately adjacent to campus. As Councilmember Briggs noted, there are a few items that still could be improved with this proposal, particularly around their environmental impacts and sustainability impacts.  But I would also be remiss not to mention that there are also some existing renters who would be displaced by this development. I am grateful to the developer for engaging it with the city and those residents to minimize this impact and help to secure additional housing and rental assistance. But if more can be done to help those individuals, I would certainly encourage it.  Finally, I will be supporting advancing this from first reading tonight because I do believe that this is exactly the location where more dense student-focused housing is needed. By adding 744 more bedrooms in an already densely populated, mostly student neighborhood, this will allow students to move closer to campus, closer to their community of peers, and could help to slow the proliferation of student housing out into other residential neighborhoods around the city, which continues to drive up our housing costs for everyone.

Amendment number three carries the power to transform our community. An investment in trauma-informed social services. These services have shown exceptional effectiveness, particularly when compared to conventional supportive services.  So, what sets Trauma-Informed Services apart? It's their ability to acknowledge, understand, and address trauma. They actively avoid re-traumatizing individuals and focus on holistic well-being rather than just treating specific issues.  This approach leads to safer, healthier communities, facilitating the reintegration of individuals involved in the criminal legal system. Leading organizations such as the Department of Justice, the Vera Institute of Justice, Urban Institute, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, and the Prison Policy Initiative have also recognized and supported the use of trauma-informed supportive services.  Their endorsement further highlights the importance and effectiveness of this approach in fostering positive outcomes for individuals and communities. Trauma-informed programs across sectors like housing, employment, mental health, substance abuse treatment, education, and family support services consider the pervasive impact of trauma and incorporate this understanding into service delivery, ultimately leading to better outcomes.  Data demonstrates the efficacy of trauma-informed services, with studies showing that these programs can reduce recidivism rates, improve health outcomes, and increase employment rates.  Moreover, the White House's Alternative Rehabilitation and Reentry Strategic Plan of April 2023 echoes our belief in the importance of trauma-informed care. It highlights the trauma endured within the criminal justice system, trauma that can lead to severe physical and mental health impacts, and creates hurdles for individuals trying to reintegrate into society post-release.  Our proposed budget amendment aligns with this strategic plan and the support of reputable organizations. By investing in trauma-informed social services, we address not just the symptoms but the root cause of the challenges faced by individuals involved in the criminal legal system. In conclusion, the effectiveness of trauma-informed social services over traditional supportive services is undeniable. They carry the potential to transform lives and communities.  So I urge you to consider this proposal and the positive impact it can have on our community. And together, let's build a future where everyone has the opportunity to heal, grow, and contribute positively to our society.

You're absolved. But yeah, I wanted to talk about the overall budget. My  I'm kind of lucky in sitting in this seat because this first budget is accomplishing a number of my priorities right off the bat. It's leveraging funds towards roads, water infrastructure, and programs that support our climate goals. I'm especially excited for the drainage study on gravel roads.  Many of those are in Ward 2, and also thank you to Councilmember Briggs, because she's also brought to attention the roads there in Ward 5, and the difficulty with city-maintained gravel roads and the drainage coming off of them. I've gotten multiple constituent comments about that, and I'm glad we're working to study those impacts.  The other thing I want to speak on in the overall budget here is the tangible investment in the black community that we are doing through the Housing Commission with our Catherine Street development. That's going to be 63 units of affordable housing. And the most important thing here, though, is the fact that the space is going to be programmed as a physical place to remember and to  to continue to commemorate the black community here. I have some words shared with me by Jamal Buffett, who is a member of the Community Leadership Council, a project specialist at Washtenaw County My Brother's Keeper, which is a group dedicated to supporting black men and black boys and just the black community more broadly. Mr. Buffett,  Bufford writes, the Community Leadership Council is comprised of residents and descendants of residents of this formerly predominantly black neighborhood. Aside from providing affordable housing for individuals coming out of shelter and artists, we want this space to have a constant presence of art honoring the rich black history from this area of Ann Arbor throughout the building. We want the first floor to be welcoming not only to residents, but also for the broader community.  We want this space to be used to address community needs, as an event, communal gathering space, to promote entrepreneurship and for skill building. We want black people in our community to begin to envision how this space can be a welcoming home. So this budget dedicates $325,000 to program this space and $150,000 to the Housing Commission to support BIPOC-owned businesses.

So this amendment proposes to appropriate $100,000 from the marijuana excise tax revenue to the Shelter Association of Washtenaw County. I appreciate Dan Kelly who called in earlier and is doing amazing work and his staff every day. Just a little broadly, the Shelter Association of Washtenaw County is the primary provider of services and emergency shelter for around 1,200 Washtenaw County individuals each year.  The association is housed at the Delana Center, which is in the 5th Ward, but obviously serves our entire community and county. It also provides additional daytime and overnight emergency shelter to individuals experiencing homelessness in the county during the winter months. Last winter, it operated five sites, including the Delana Center, a hotel offsite for those with acute medical conditions, a rotating shelter at the community congregations throughout the county,  and two monthly day shelters locations, one in Ypsilanti and the other in Ann Arbor. Last November, City Council approved $72,000 to the Shelter Association for winter emergency sheltering. However, as Mr. Kelly noted, the Shelter Association saw first a 30% increase and then it stabilized at around 20% increase over past winters in terms of need. And as he also mentioned, they're seeing a greater acuity of need  of folks that they are serving. So I am, you know, excited to be moving this forward in terms of providing additional support that can serve both the winter sheltering this winter, but throughout the entire year as well.", "start": 5710.218, "end": 5814.617, "Transition": "\"\"", "Meeting Section": "Other", "Speaker Role": "Other", "is_public_comment": 0, "is_public_hearing": 0, "is_comment_start_trigger": 0, "is_comment_end_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_start_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_end_trigger": 0}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_11", "text": "Council Member Rodino.", "start": 5814.617, "end": 5815.457, "Transition": "\"\"", "Meeting Section": "Other", "Speaker Role": "Other", "is_public_comment": 0, "is_public_hearing": 0, "is_comment_start_trigger": 0, "is_comment_end_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_start_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_end_trigger": 0}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_24", "text": "Thank you, Mayor Taylor. I am proud to be sponsoring this resolution tonight alongside Councilmembers Briggs, Cornell, Watson, and Ackman in support of the Shelter Association of Washtenaw County. This amendment directly invests in and supports the important work being done by the Delawana Center to provide shelter and services to our city's homeless population.  I want to make sure that, you know, Councilmember Briggs spoke about some of the work that this will help to accomplish, but I also want to address the fact that housing insecurity and homelessness is a crisis that disproportionately impacts marginalized communities. Most racial minority groups, especially African Americans and indigenous people, experience homelessness at higher rates, a direct result of historic and structural ongoing racism.  According to the National Alliance to End Homelessness, the most striking disparity can be found among African Americans who, according to 2022 data, represent just 13% of the general population but accounted for 37% of the people experiencing homelessness and more than 49% of the homeless families with children.  Additionally, I want to make sure we continue to acknowledge that LGBTQ plus individuals are significantly more likely to experience homelessness. According to the Williams Institute, 17% of lesbian, gay, and bisexual adults and 30% of transgender adults have experienced homelessness at some point in their lives, compared to just 6% of the U.S. population at large.  We know that the leading cause of homelessness is economic hardship, and the Institute's 2020 research also found that 22% of LGBTQ adults live in poverty in the U.S. compared to 16% of non-LGBTQ people, and that 8% of transgender adults reported experiencing homelessness in the past year compared to 3% of non-transgender lesbian, gay, and bisexual people, and 1% of cisgender heterosexual adults.  Homelessness is a complex issue and one size fits all. There is not a one size fits all solution. And that's why it is imperative that as we continue to address our community's housing and affordability crisis, we also continue to invest in and support the agencies and organizations doing the work to provide shelter and critical services to those experiencing homelessness.  Frankly, $100,000 is not nearly enough, but as we heard from Dan Kelly this evening during public comment, it will help to support some of our community's most vulnerable residents. For that reason, I ask for my colleague's support with this amendment.

And just taking this in the first part, which is the eviction prevention dollars, we allocated $305,000 toward eviction prevention earlier this year.  Mrs. Hall and the Housing Commission have allocated almost half of that money already. So that's how much need there is, and that's how quickly we are going through these funds. And because these families and individuals are on the edge, pushed there by rising food prices,  and other costs of living here. That money is able to stop them from facing eviction and facing homelessness and keeps them housed and creates a position where we are following that housing first model rather than trying to act on the back end and get people back into housing once they've fallen out of it.  I wanted to also kind of draw attention to kind of how this money can be spent. Mrs. Hall says that their staff can work directly with tenants, landlords, courts, the Hawk Housing line, and other nonprofits.  So I'm really excited that this money can go to such a direct need. And the other portion of this amendment is allocating $250,000 to youth services. There's low-income youth services, and those are places like community action network sites, Peace Neighborhood Center, and just any organization that provides services to low-income youth is eligible.  It's in the face of COVID and I think the mental health crisis and also just the lack of opportunity for youth to come together and enjoy what our community has to offer. I think this money is directed in a way to  to help improve the situation of youth here in our city.

According to research from the After School Alliance, we also know that experiencing youth programming can significantly change outcomes related to mental and physical health, make one less likely to be a perpetrator or a victim of violence, and improves academic performance, self-esteem, and relationships.  However, BIPOC children are 10% less likely than white middle to upper class children to participate in after school or youth programming due to financial hardship. Therefore, with our city being the eighth most economically segregated city in the nation, I think that it is essential  that as these disparities increase, that we make sure that our children continue to have access and the ability to experience quality youth programming.

It includes things like street light replacement, crosswalk improvements, traffic calming, sidewalk construction and ramp repair, road configurations, accessible pedestrian signals, neighborhood bike parking pilot, as well as staff time to work with the Treeline Conservancy on the Treeline Trail.  This doesn't even count federal grants and earmarks that we're pushing for, nor does it count the investment that we put into infrastructure for people to safely walk and bike as we work on our road reconstruction projects. So I just wanted to say thank you to staff for reflecting those values in our budget.  I also wanted to comment on another topic. I don't think that it's part of our consideration and vote tonight, but I wanted to comment on the city administrator's idea to shore up the city's financial sustainability through the sale of the Klein lot and developing on the mezzanine plaza of City Hall for high-density residential development.  I think housing of virtually any kind is a better land use than a surface parking lot. And underutilized office space as well. So I really support us thinking in this direction.

We want to retain our competitive advantage as a workplace of choice. So that means that we're responding to current expectations about hybrid work.

I am honored to sponsor this resolution alongside my Ward 3 colleague, Council Member Ghazi Edwin, and our fellow co-sponsors to designate Southeast Area Park as Ann Arbor's Bicentennial Park. I will try not to repeat everything that my colleague just mentioned, although some of it might be worth renoting.  By selecting Southeast Area Park as our Bicentennial Park, we would be creating an opportunity for historic investment in a park that not only serves as a gateway into Ann Arbor from the southeast side, along both Ellsworth and Platt roads, but is also a critical community gathering space in one of our most socioeconomically, racially, and ethnically diverse parts of the city.  Southeast Area Park was the location of the first annual Black Asian Solidarity Picnic. It's where AFC Ann Arbor hosted Community Iftar last year. It is located in close proximity to the Bryant Community Center, to Creekside Court Community Center, to several of our city's housing cooperatives, and is a popular destination for residents all over the city, but especially for residents in Ann Arbor's Southeast Area neighborhoods.  Thanks to AAATA, which has a bus stop right outside the park, Southeast Area Park is accessible to residents from all around Ann Arbor and from surrounding communities. And while I know envisioning for what a Bicentennial Park could be is still ongoing and dependent on investment and securing private funding, we already heard about the possibility of a universal access splash pad.  which as a PAC member, I will note that increasing water access in our city parks throughout the city remains a priority. And this is not an amenity currently offered at Southeast Area Park. A possible sculpture garden paying tribute to indigenous people, a sculpture honoring former Olympians, community garden plots, additional parks programming, and possible partnerships with OSI to contribute to our climate goals.  I will note, however, that these potential improvements will not be realized overnight. The reality remains that if this amendment is approved, much of this work still needs to be accomplished by raising private funds. So I also urge our community to please embrace this opportunity to directly invest in supporting Bicentennial Park and an opportunity to invest in Ann Arbor's southeast side.  Finally, I just want to thank park staff for working with us to envision what this shift would mean and working with us to craft this resolution. I know I personally, as someone who lives relatively nearby to this park, see its use every single day, see how much it means to the community around me. And to be able to share that with the rest of the city and to celebrate this park in a way that it really deserves would be truly special.
