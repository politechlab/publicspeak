If there is no objection, the minutes will be signed.  Hearing no objection, the minutes are being signed. Will the clerk please affix my signature to the minutes? Adoption of the referral calendar.

If there is no objection, the agenda will be adopted.  Hearing no objection, the agenda is adopted. Colleagues, welcome back. Happy New Year. This is the first full council meeting of 2021.  Excited for us to kick off this meeting and looking forward to, as I said this morning, a year of lots of hard work before us this year and beyond. So at this time, we are going to go ahead and open the remote public comment period for items on the city council agenda, introduction and referral calendar, and the council's work program. I want to thank everyone for their ongoing patience and cooperation as we continue to operate this remote public comment system.  It does remain the strong intent of the City Council to have remote public comment regularly included on our meeting agendas. However, as a reminder, the City Council reserves the right to end or eliminate these public comment periods at any point if we deem that the system is being abused or is no longer suitable for allowing our meetings to be conducted efficiently and effectively.  I'll moderate the public comment period in the following manner. The public comment period for this meeting is 20 minutes, and each speaker will be given two minutes to speak. I'll call on each speaker by name and in the order in which they registered on the council's website. If you are listening and have not yet registered to speak but would like to, you can still sign up before the end of public comment by going to the council's website at seattle.gov forward slash council, C-O-U-N-C-I-L,  The public comment link is also listed on today's agenda. Once I call a speaker's name, staff will unmute the appropriate microphone and the speaker will hear an automatic prompt of you have been unmuted. After the speaker hears that automatic prompt, the speaker will need to press star six before speaking.  Please begin speaking by stating your name and the item that you are addressing. As a reminder, public comment should relate to an item on today's agenda, the introduction and referral calendar, or the Council's work program.  At about 10 seconds, the speaker will hear a chime. That chime is your cue to begin wrapping up your public comment as you will only have 10 seconds of your allotted two minutes left to address the council. If speakers don't end their comments at the end of the allotted time provided, the speaker's microphone will be muted to allow us to call on the next speaker.  Once you've completed your public comment, I would ask that you please disconnect from the line, and if you plan to continue following this meeting, you can do so via Seattle Channel or the listening options listed on the agenda. The public comment period is now open, and we will begin with the first speaker on the list. Again, as a reminder, the speaker will hear  the prompt, you have been unmuted, and then the speaker needs to press star six after the speaker hears a prompt of you have been unmuted.

We can hear you.  Hello, my name is Arianna Laureano. I'm an American with a disability and a renter in the University District in Seattle, and I'm calling in in support of Council Member Sawant's bill to extend the eviction moratorium by one year. I'm an underpaid essential worker. I've worked the entirety of the pandemic. My expenses went up with COVID and my pay went down. I've lost wages to quarantine almost every month. Meanwhile, my burden has increased and the workplace has become deadly.  Healthcare expenses also rose drastically in 2021 for me and many others to account for the minimum wage raise. And now I owe $4,000 to an abusive slumlord. I've already cut into meds and foods at time to make rent, which has impacted my health and further risk my stability. My household has been living on ramen and rice for the past year, and my dog has gone hungry at times. We are formerly homeless, so we know what is coming. I have a tent and camping gear ready.  I lived paycheck to paycheck before this pandemic, and this isn't getting better. It's getting worse. Without extending the moratorium or finding a way to erase this debt, we will be homeless again. I have nowhere to cut from except for food, medicine, and healthcare, and I am in very poor health. I know in my heart that my life and the lives of many others rest in your hands upon your policies. My name is Ariana Laureano, and if I die on the streets of Seattle in 2021,  It will be your political choice. You may have saved us from COVID only to kill us with poverty.

Good afternoon. Happy New Year. Howard Gale, District 7, commenting on police accountability.  Today, you're going to be voting on a law establishing and clarifying subpoena powers of the Office of Police Accountability and the Office of the Inspector General, contingent upon the police unions accepting this law during the current contract bargaining. This highlights two well-established failures of our so-called police accountability system. One, that justice and community safety can and has been routinely given away by the city when bargaining union contracts with police.  And second, that the city council's predilection for form over substance when it comes to police accountability. Unless the right questions are asked in a police use of force investigation, unless an officer's claims are subject to critical inquiry, then tools like subpoenas are completely meaningless. For example, in the OPA investigation into the 2019 SPD murder of Ryan Smith, officers made claims concerning their fears that Ryan Smith's girlfriend was seriously injured and facing imminent harm  despite the abundant evidence that 911 operators knew for a fact that not to be the case. Yet in the OPA investigation, no 911 personnel or SPD command staff were interviewed to determine how this happened or if the officers were lying. Subpoenas are irrelevant without truly independent investigations. Seattle needs true police accountability as other U.S. cities voted to have this last November  based on real community oversight with an elected body capable of investigating and disciplining police, and of course, having subpoena powers. But subpoenas in the hands of people that are not asking the right questions is not gonna give us accountability.

The legislation creates a process for the OPA and the OIG to directly issue the subpoena and enforce them by seeking a court order should the subject of the subpoena fail to comply. The new legislation specifically requires that individuals and third party record holders serve the subpoena are provided a written notice of their right to due process.  This specific protection was not codified previously, and this addition is intended to increase civilian participation in OPA investigations.  and OIG audits and reviews. Subpoena authority for the Seattle Police Officers Guild and the Seattle Police Management Association is still subject to collective bargaining requirements.

And I'll speak briefly now to all nine appointments, even though we'll take three separate votes. Colleagues, as you know, each mode of transportation has its own separate master plan, so we've got separate advisory boards. Over Zoom, members of the Transportation Committee on December 16 were able to meet and ask questions of all the new appointees. I believe these applicants came across as qualified and deeply interested in these important transportation issues.  I believe they also indicated open-minded and balanced views on transportation in order to help us break down the different silos of each mode and see the bigger picture of an interconnected transportation network that can keep us mobile and protect our environment.

It is in coordination with approximately 150 other cities today that we bring this resolution forward in coordination with the Smart Cities Policy Group,  to honor all of those who have lost lives and lost family members to the consequences of COVID. Many individuals have lost lives and many family members have been impacted by COVID, and we will never, never forget this experience over the last year, and we want to make sure that we honor individuals and their family members who have been dealing with the consequences of COVID.  Yesterday marked the one year anniversary of the loss of the first life locally here in the Seattle region to COVID-19.  I want to acknowledge all of the individuals who over the last year have lost individuals and their families to COVID and all of the incredibly hard work that many in our community have spent over the last year and helping to make sure that individuals have what they need in this time of loss and to hopefully save as many lives as possible. But last week we saw our country's 500,000th death  number for our country in terms of the number of lost lives across our country. While locally we have our County Board of Health and our health systems that are working very hard to prevent deaths,  We know that there's incredible challenges in front of us as we seek more equitable responses to care and a more equitable COVID response. There's incredible disparities that exist within our communities, especially in the black, indigenous and people of color communities, which are much more likely to contract COVID and die from the consequences of this disease.  The proclamation in front of us today serves as an incredible reminder and acknowledgement of the deep impacts and toll that COVID-19 has taken on our communities, including the loss of lives, the people who have lost loved ones, and the people whose lives are forever changed due to the long-lasting impacts of COVID-19. For us, we know that these are not just statistics. These are our friends. These are our family members. These are our team members. These are our neighbors.  And today we have an incredible opportunity to recognize and honor the lives of those that have been lost due to COVID, but through one of our own family members here at the Seattle City Council.  I'm humbled to be presenting this proclamation to a family member of our own, legislative department staff and friend, ally and community leader. Thank you to Alexis Oliver, I'm sorry, Alexis for being here with us and her parents, Linda and Alexander Oliver for being here today to honor the incredible life of your family member, daughter and sister, Marianne Julie Oliver.  I want to turn this over, Mr. President, to any others who would like to offer comments, and then we have our incredible guests here with us today. But it is a truly humbling day to be able to recognize March 1st as this incredibly important marker, as we recognize the lives that have been lost to COVID and the important legacy that these lives have as we continue to endeavor to fight back.  and to push for more equitable responses and honor the lives of those who've been impacted by COVID. Thank you, Mr. President.", "start": 78, "end": 294, "Transition": "\"\"", "Meeting Section": "Other", "Speaker Role": "Other", "is_public_comment": 0, "is_public_hearing": 0, "is_comment_start_trigger": 0, "is_comment_end_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_start_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_end_trigger": 0}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_13", "text": "Thank you, Council Member Mosqueda.

We had no idea that a year later we'd still be working from home, nor could we have anticipated that we would experience a pandemic that was spiraling out of control.  We have all been touched by the devastation that COVID-19 has wrought. We all know somebody who's been affected. And too many of us have lost loved ones, sisters, daughters, uncles, grandparents. We know that communities of color must have a priority in vaccine distribution. And we also know that this pandemic is not over.

I would like to give thanks to council member Teresa Moscata and to Tammy Morales.  I thank you all very much for this proclamation. And I would like to thank Tammy for, you have to really forgive me right now, but Tammy, thank you so much for being a support to my daughter and to my family and also your husband, Harry, because if it wasn't for Harry, my husband wouldn't be sitting here today. He had complications.  from cancer and Harry was right there. He brought him through. And through the sickness, when my daughter was first diagnosed with COVID, Harry says, call me at any time. And I did because I had a lot of questions. This is a disease you don't even understand. You don't understand your loved one there. You can't visit them. You can't hold their hand.  And to see your child, not just, this is your child, the person you brought into the world. Even though she was an adult, she has three children, but that's still your baby. And Harry says, okay, and I thank your family. And thank you for being a support for Alexis too. Mickey was my oldest. That's the one that made us parents in the beginning.  And by her being so much older, she was the type person that she checked on everybody. By her being the first grandchild, the first girl, she checked on everybody. The aunts, the uncles, the grandparents.  She made sure that even when she was little, she made sure that they were looked after. And she said, we got to go see them. And she would call them up. And as she got older in grade school, we had moved to California. And her friend, she had made friends with this little girl, but the family didn't have much. So  It was school time, and Mickey goes, I can't go to school. I said, what do you mean? She says, my friend, her parents couldn't buy her, you know, didn't have the capability of buying her shoes or clothes to start school. So in order for her to go to school,  My husband and I said, well, I guess we have to buy the little girls some, you know, we bought her some clothes in school. And then her mother didn't have the resources to wash the clothes. And we had just bought a washer and dryer. So we washed the clothes and fed the family. But this was her way of doing throughout her life, even as an adult. When she had three children, she did the same.  Everybody knew one thing, Marion, Mickey, you could go there. You would find, she would feed you. She would take care of you. She worked for a children's center and she would call me a mom. There's nobody for this child. So, and working for that children's center, we would end up buying  things for this one little girl. And then she would bring them home and we would feed them and everything. But this was her life. This was the way she was. And her friends miss her. Her children definitely miss her. And I and her dad, we're devastated because how do you get through this when  We were on a Zoom call. And you see your loved one leave, drift away. And we didn't know. We were happy. We were thinking she's getting better. And the nurse said, no, she wasn't. And in this time, all I can say for anyone, please get the vaccine. Wear your mask. Wash your hands.  because to see your loved one leave us on a zoo, I mean, and even when we went to see her at the funeral home, we couldn't even touch her then because she was so sick and this is how this disease did. So I thank you all and I pray for all the other people in  not only to Seattle, but in the entire world, because it is the most devastating thing I've ever seen.

Howard Gale, District 7, commenting on continuing police abuse and failed accountability.  This afternoon, you will consider the council's proposed 2021 work program. The section of the work program on police accountability for 2021 reads like it was written in 2017, before George Floyd, before a seven-year-old child was sprayed in the face with chemical irritant, before over 13 SBD officers stood around and watched a woman they illegally arrested have repeated seizures as they stood around and did nothing.  Before Aubriana Inda was hit directly in the chest with a blast ball and, as noted in multiple media reports, died three times. Before an SBD officer, gratuitously and with clear malice, threw a blast ball at Seattle Gay News reporter Renee Rackety, concussing her and damaging her hearing. Before the injuries, beatings, and false arrests suffered by hundreds since last June. Before the SBD murders of Charlena Lyles, Aosea Falotogo, Danny Rodriguez, Ryan Smith.  Sean Leifer, Terry Kaver, and just recently Derek Hayden two weeks ago. None of these people will obtain any measure of justice or accountability under our current police accountability system. Yet for 2021, the council proposes more of the same with no significant changes. Have we learned nothing in the last nine months? Is it all forgotten so easily? Shame on any council member that allows this retrograde and thoughtless part of the 2021 council work program to pass without objection. Why does Seattle not observe  not deserve the police accountability system that the people of Newark, New Jersey, Nashville, Tennessee, San Diego, Portland, Oregon, and Chicago have chosen, a system that even our own Washington state legislature is now considering, a system providing for full civilian control of investigating and sanctioning police abuse without police investigating police. Yet the City Council and Community Police Commission have determined that Seattle should be exempt from these best practices. Why does Seattle remain stuck in self-serving, dysfunctional police accountability  that routinely allows officers to get away with abuse and sometimes even murder.", "start": 1299, "end": 1420, "Transition": "\"\"", "Meeting Section": "Public Comment", "Speaker Role": "Commenter", "is_public_comment": 1, "is_public_hearing": 0, "is_comment_start_trigger": 0, "is_comment_end_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_start_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_end_trigger": 0}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_13", "text": "Thank you, Mr. Gale, and thank you for being able to wrap up right at your two-minute mark.

My name is Karen Gehlen, and I am a resident of District 7.  I am commenting on the Council 2021 work program included in the introduction and referral calendar. I urge you to include some critical missing elements. Within the Community Economic Development Committee, there is a line item regarding economic recovery for small businesses and workers impacted by the COVID. Impacts to downtown businesses predate the pandemic with open drug use, sidewalk camping, shoplifting, and personal safety concerns driving visitors away from downtown.  Unless these are addressed, downtown's decline will continue long after the pandemic ends. The work plan for the Public Safety and Human Services Committee infers that reducing the size and removing funding from the police department is an objective in and of itself. None of the work items appear to recognize that we are experiencing increases in violent crime and that public safety must be the determiner of police budget and staffing levels.  I did know one promising item called Community Safety Initiative, which seems to address the needs of the public, yet it is limited only to District 1. I would hope that Council Member Herbal would expand her efforts to recognize that everyone in the city can benefit from a program leading to increased feelings of safety. The Human Services Work Program includes one public health item. It addresses the city's response to COVID, but fails to recognize the other ongoing public health challenges, including TB and hepatitis.  Our biggest public health challenges, untreated mental health and chronic drug abuse are completely missing from the work program. Addressing these issues should be at the highest priority for the council since they are the primary underlying causes of inhumane and unhealthy encampments on our streets and in our parks.

Council Colleagues, appointment 01779 is Interim Director Stephen Marchese, who we have all had the chance to meet, I think, in various forums. For folks who haven't yet had a chance to meet Mr. Marchese, there is, I think, invitation circling for us to have a chance to have one-on-one conversations.  Mr. Marchese did come to our committee last meeting and was unanimously recommended for his appointment as permanent director of the Office of Labor Standards. Stephen Marchese will join the city with over 20 years of public service experience, most recently serving as the public service director for the Minnesota State Bar Association.  leading efforts to link pro bono legal services to organizations that serve the public. Additionally, he served as the director of St. Paul's School Board. In this role, sustained relationships with communities, employees, leadership, labor representatives, and elected officials, all in service of bringing high quality education and respectful work environments  His legal background and expertise in working with community partners to secure access to legal services is extensive. And we're all very impressed by his ongoing commitments to RSJI and social justice initiative work and the work that is currently being led by various members of the change team within Office of Labor Standards and among their leadership team.  I had the chance to meet with Acting Director Marchese a couple weeks ago, and I know that many of you were probably impressed by the same things that I was. First, a direct interest in making sure that there was ongoing commitments to labor standards through both a racial equity and social justice lens. Mr. Marchese reflected on his childhood and how the things that he experienced are reflected in the values that he brings to work.  We know that Mayor Durkan and the team did extensive outreach to recruit candidates and shepherd in the opportunity to have a competitive process. And it is through this competitive and inclusive process that Mr. Marchese rose to the top candidate for our consideration today.  I really appreciate that Acting Director Marchese and his family have helped bring the, Mr. Marchese has moved his family to Seattle and has really helping to bring the labor standards issues that we all as a council  that have passed in response to COVID, putting those first and foremost in terms of the items on his to-do list and making sure that those who are most impacted by COVID, especially our lowest wage workers, have access to the resources and protections that they need, as well as small businesses and making sure that they understand access to information about the newest laws and how to protect their workers.  This is a long way of saying thank you, Mr. Marchese, for your willingness to serve in this role as Office of Labor Standards Director. And for all of the folks who participated in your nomination process, I want to thank them for their detailed interview that they did with you and for you, Mr. Marchese, in filling out  our lengthy question and answer document, which we have circulated to the city. I want to thank Sejal Parikh as well, who led on the work within council to help make sure that council members, members of the community, labor and business had a chance to weigh in on those questions. And we greatly appreciate the lens in which you answer those questions and look forward to working with you in this role.

I know you're a strict moderator, so I'll try to keep my comments brief, coming from the Land Use Committee.  You know, I think we've discussed this at length over the last couple months. We've had three committee sessions to mark up this bill, to talk about it, and to thoroughly vet it with the public and stakeholders. You know, I think it's important  as homelessness is the defining issue that we're facing as a city, and in a lot of ways, the defining issue of urban policy nationally, that we be able to go to the public and say that we are doing everything that we can to stretch the value of taxpayer dollars, to make life easier for the builders that are out there making the permanent supportive housing, and to structure policy in a way that is bespoke to the unique needs and unique challenges  that people in the permanent supportive housing field have faced over the years in an area that we as Seattleites have really been a pioneer in cultivating through Plymouth Housing, Downtown Emergency Service Center, Chief Seattle Club and others. And with this bill, we go one step closer. We can go and tell the people of Seattle  You know, we took a hard look at what are the processes? Where is the red tape that we can cut? What are the things that could be streamlined? And that experience has told us we can move past, you know, bypassing new laws and changing regulations. And with this legislation,  We can carve off almost $50,000 per unit in cost to build permanent supportive housing. We can make sure that those buildings are going up faster and with tighter timelines to make sure that they're coming online to help take pressure off of our shelter system and get more of our neighbors inside. And today we can take that step and I look forward to voting this through. I do want to thank  Jacob Thorpe and Parker Dawson on my staff for their work in really putting this together with a bunch of stakeholders over the past couple months. I want to thank those stakeholders over at Plymouth Housing, Sarah Rankin over at the University of Washington. Really want to thank the Third Door Coalition folks, Matt Galvin, Chad over there at El Gaucho.  It really shows what we can do when we come together and focus on solving a problem rather than pointing fingers at each other about what isn't getting done.

We all know that permanent supportive housing is well established as the most effective and the most cost-effective solution to chronic homelessness. People who live outside live stably for long stretches of their lives outside, who struggle with disabilities and are unable to afford rent. Out of that cohort of folks, 95% of people stay housed  in permanent supportive housing regardless of their mental health or substance abuse disorder or their disability. Research conducted at Seattle University School of Law found that permanent supportive housing is associated with better outcomes related to quality of life, emergency services, physical and psychiatric hospitalizations, and substance abuse.  Better outcomes for residents also save money, making permanent supportive housing, again, the most cost-effective long-term solution to chronic homelessness. Permanent supportive housing is also cheaper for the public than the alternatives. One year of permanent supportive housing costs the same as only three days in a hospital or three months in jail.  I've consistently called for doubling the city's investment in permanent supportive housing. And last year, I, among I think every member of the city council, joined the launch of the Third Door Coalition and signed on to support their plan.  to build 6,500 units of permanent supportive housing in King County in the next five years.

Council colleagues, this legislation is critical to addressing our ongoing housing crisis currently and  As currently, even affordable housing projects started today could take anywhere from four to six years to design. So creating permanent housing, building that housing, and making sure that it's designed well makes it important for us to do everything that we can to expeditiously create permanent supportive housing across our city.  I am happy to be in full support of this legislation today, and I believe that it will shorten that timeline, bring much needed housing online much faster for those who are impacted by the lack of access to affordable housing throughout our community. We must also be looking at near-term solutions to help shelter those who are in need most, whether through tiny homes or apartment acquisitions or the ongoing efforts that we continue to talk about for the immediate non-congregate shelter options.  We must do everything that we can to ensure that there is a pipeline out of those shelters and building more permanent supportive housing is the exit plan to open up more beds so that folks who are living outside have a place to go in our shelters. We must have a permanent supportive housing and doing this bill today passes a clear message that we are moving forward, addressing the regulatory barriers to building permanently affordable housing while also identifying funding and all opportunities  to expand our shelter capacity as soon as possible.

Resolution 31996 is simply the scheduling of the hearings of some additional appeals of the hearing examiner's report regarding the local improvement district number 6751, also known as the waterfront lid.  City Council rules for quasi-judicial proceedings require that the Council set the time and place for the hearing of an appeal of an individual's final assessment for a local improvement district within 15 days of the filing of a valid appeal. Adoption of the proposed resolution 31996 today, March 1st, would meet the quasi-judicial rules deadline for scheduling valid appeals that had been filed through February 16, 2021.

Less than one hour ago, under pressure from this resolution and a grassroots movement, Mayor Durkan agreed to extend the moratorium for three months to the end of June. This is not everything the renters movement is fighting for, but it is a clear victory for those who have been fighting for it. Obviously, we would have preferred more than 43 minutes notice before this resolution came up for a vote.  that the mayor was responding to our demands. And the timing is, shall we say, an improbable coincidence. However, given this breaking news, I am open to holding the vote on this resolution, which is why I'm proposing that it be held for three months until June 7th. Hopefully before then, the mayor and the governor will agree to extend the moratorium to the end of this year as this resolution requests. And if they do not, we will have the resolution ready for a vote at that time.  I think it is important that our growing renters rights movement claim today's announcement by the mayor as a movement victory, as a sign of our growing power. The mayor did not extend the moratorium protections for the full year as our movement is demanding, but in conceding to a three month  extension of the rent and in protection, she did something that big business and the landlord lobby, corporate landlord lobby to be clear, has bitterly fought against. So who rightfully holds claim to this victory? It's the 3,683 community members, ordinary people,  who signed our petitions calling for a moratorium extension. There are 210 community members who wrote personal moving stories to the city council about how they were struggling and why the moratorium must be extended. The hundreds of people who have written other letters and spoken up in public comment demanding an extension of the eviction moratorium.

I'm not clear why Council Member Peterson wants to postpone the vote. He has already voted no on the bill, so we know where he stands on it. I'm not clear what, in any honesty, Council Member Peterson proposes to learn more about the bill  between now and the 29th, I believe, which is what you suggested. I mean, the fact is that we've been discussing right to counsel not only all year, which means now over two months. Actually, this point about having legal aid for renters facing eviction has been a point that has been discussed  by the council over three budget seasons because it was three years ago that the People's Budget Movement and my office were able to win the first ever city of Seattle funding for eviction defense attorneys. And then since then, every budget season, we have been able to expand that funding. So we already have evidence, statistical evidence that is actually helping renters. But more than that, we have evidence from,  multiple cities about how not only have they already passed right to counsel, meaning guaranteed right, that you will have a trained attorney along your side when you face an eviction, when you go to court, but these cities, many of these cities like New York City, like San Francisco have, but by no means limited to those cities, have already passed right to counsel  Several years ago, this was well before the pandemic, and so we have the advantage of seeing overwhelming and very strong statistical evidence if council members want to be data-driven about how much it helps every renters. As eviction defense attorneys have themselves said,  having a lawyer to prevent an eviction could potentially mean life and death difference. We've seen the numbers here. We've seen the losing home report from the Women's Commission and the King County Bar Association that shows that nearly 90% of people who  face who end up evicted also end up then becoming homeless. So this is a devastating experience. It's sort of a pipeline to homelessness unless evictions are prevented. And I'm not sure what a two week delay is going to accomplish beyond what we have already discussed. We've had extensive discussion in two committees, but also, as I said, all this year and in the past,  Three years, we've had presentation after presentation from the attorneys themselves, not just from tenants rights advocates in general, but from attorneys themselves who have shown us powerful evidence about how in cities that have right to counsel, especially in cities that have strong right to counsel, there's actually had  a positive impact not only on how it prevents eviction but also on how eviction filings themselves have gone down because landlords now know that they face not just a vulnerable tenant by themselves but a trained attorney who is going to know exactly what to do to prevent that eviction make sure to connect the tenant to  other sources of help, like renter assistance. But as we know, renter assistance, rental assistance cannot work by itself. Rental assistance and eviction defense are complements to each other. Preventing the eviction in court legally is a necessary component of protecting our renters, and we know  how deeply evictions are racially and gender biased. We know it's women and specifically black women who are deeply affected by evictions. And we see from New York City, for example, that 86% of tenants who are represented by council are remaining in their home. This is just staggering evidence of what good  we can do by little amount of funding. I mean, I can promise you, regardless of which sort of spectrum of estimates you look at, the eviction defense from the city will cost less than 1% of the Seattle Police Department's budget.  It shows that it saves lives, literally saves lives. That's not hyperbole. And we have discussed this a lot. We have seen a lot of overwhelming data-driven evidence. I'm not sure what can be gleaned by waiting. What will happen if we wait actually is that it affects renters even more because they wouldn't have this protection. It will delay having that protection. And I would also add,  My staff have done extensive outreach to council members, especially who are in the committee. Council Member Peterson is in the committee, asking them about questions that we can answer from my office, asking them to submit questions to central staff. Asha Venkatraman from the central staff has done an excellent job taking every question that came her way very seriously and providing numbers-based data. So again, just in closing, I'm not sure what would be gained by delay  other than an attempt to derail the movement that is clearly ready to fight and win today, this right to counsel without loopholes.", "start": 956, "end": 1281, "Transition": "\"\"", "Meeting Section": "Other", "Speaker Role": "Other", "is_public_comment": 0, "is_public_hearing": 0, "is_comment_start_trigger": 0, "is_comment_end_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_start_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_end_trigger": 0}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_08", "text": "Council Member Herbold, please.", "start": 1285, "end": 1286, "Transition": "\"\"", "Meeting Section": "Other", "Speaker Role": "Other", "is_public_comment": 0, "is_public_hearing": 0, "is_comment_start_trigger": 0, "is_comment_end_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_start_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_end_trigger": 0}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_06", "text": "Thanks.

You know, I too am really excited about this bill. I think that the right to counsel is fundamental in a lot of things that we do in society and that historically in the United States, as a lot of us on this council who are lawyers are well aware, we have not extended a right to counsel in a lot of civil circumstances, including eviction proceedings, and that has had horribly inequitable and unfair consequences.

And you know, with this motion coming forward,  I can't say that I disagree that it might make a difference to wait until the 29th because of some of the follow-up information I've received from the law department and drilling down into some of their concerns. I think it's important to note  that part of the reason this council has been so profoundly successful in producing pro-tenant legislation that survives rigorous and well-funded legal challenges. There's a reason we don't have to do a landlord right to council. They're going to sue and come after this the way they've come after everything else. And our law department has been able to turn them back  and win and defend those rights in court because we have worked carefully to construct legislation that will survive those attacks. There are a couple of  salient issues that I still think need to be tightened up in places to make sure that this will survive those challenges. And I would be interested in having a full-on executive session for the benefit of the entire council on this legislation during the time  that we have between now and when Councilmember Peterson is requesting we take this up again to see if we can figure out ways to  Even if it doesn't lead to material changes in the bill, strengthen up through recitals or statements or comments on legislative intent or whatever else to really show how we are structuring this to fit within the constraints of some legal issues we need to be mindful of.

I'm away from the site, so I'm trying to do this through the phone. I want to support a request for delay, and I want to really thank Council Member Herbert for her words. This has struck me as an important bill, and I do want to make it a better bill. I do want to make it a better law.  We talked about, as you know, there are lawyers on this council. We all know that we have a Sixth Amendment right to counsel based on, you know, obviously on the United States Constitution and its criminality. But we should point out that there are six other areas in which we provide free legal representation based on eligibility, not a means testing eligibility.  through Office of Public Defense, and that is in dependency actions, that is in mental health issues, that's in outstanding warrants, that's with youth who are facing civil proceedings, people who face contempt for failure to pay child support, civil commitment. So there's a whole array of where the government steps in and pays for legal counsel outside of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel when you're charged and you're deemed eligible  to have legal counsel. So we're indigent, I'm sorry. So I had an opportunity to just pull up and look at the Department of Policies and Procedures under OPD. And I believe I talked to council member Lewis about this offline. I think all the energy and the intentionality of this is right on. I think this is something we should be doing. I'm concerned about the cost and I'm concerned about eligibility.  I believe that there should be some determining client eligibility like we do in all these other areas. And I think that probably if we sit down and look at how we would restructure some of the eligibility requirements, I think that we could have a lower standard for people to have free legal counsel in the event that they are being evicted unfairly.  And it can look something like what OPD, our Office of Public Defense, does. And so I would encourage my colleagues to look at that. And I think I did share this with Councilmember Lewis. And again, it isn't that I'm against the movement. I'm not against homeless people. I'm not against all the things that come up. What I really want is a piece of legislation that I can vote yes on that can guarantee legal counsel to people who are eligible.  And those are obviously going to be low-income people. They're not going to be the same people that we would look at for eligibility requirements for criminal. And I think the standard should be higher. And I think if we were to try to pass it today under its logical conclusion, just common sense, I'm not trying to start a movement here, but does this mean that if I make $100,000 a year and I decide to quit paying my rent in August, I just don't want to pay it anymore?  that I get a free lawyer and the city picks up the tab. I don't think that's right. And so I want to make it right. I want to make it better. I want it to be able to withstand legal scrutiny. And I think what Councilmember Lewis said is, and I appreciate this, and we've seen the memos, and thank you, Asha, for your great memos. We've seen the memos that came out of the law department. I think if we had an executive session, how we can carve out some of this and have this eligibility requirement,  and make it so that we protect these people under these difficult circumstances, that they have legal counsel during eviction hearings, then that's something that I want to do.

It is poor people who get evicted, and that's clear.  Prior to the pandemic, tenants already faced tough odds in eviction court if they didn't have legal representation. And as eviction moratoria are lifted across the country and here in Washington, and the public emergency is in the rearview mirror,  we know that many of our neighbors will be in even tougher situations.

I too underscore the importance of making sure that folks have access to legal protections. I think this council has done a tremendous job in listening to not just renters, but to small landlords as well, as we've been thinking about a both and approach  making sure people have protections, but also making sure our smallest landlords have access to dollars via rental assistance and other support. I would absolutely support moving forward on this today, but also want to make sure that we're on solid legal ground.  I have had conversations with folks in the Office of Housing and asked whether or not there was concerns based on the review of the committee meeting that I saw last week where questions were asked about public housing and the impact on public housing and I was assured that there was no concerns.

I am going to support a motion to hold this bill based on the debate and the conversation that I'm hearing.  unfold in full counsel today. I do, like Councilmember Herbold and many others, support the underlying goal and purpose of this legislation. And so my support of a motion to hold is a procedural vote and not one about the substance of the underlying policy. I have, in fact, in the past supported and in some instances  agreed to, if memory serves me, co-sponsor some of Councilmember Sawant's and Councilmember Herbold's efforts to increase funding for legal aid and legal defense in the space of tenant protections and continue to believe that having a systemic fix to the issues facing tenants who are at a significant disadvantage in legal proceedings is the right  policy for the city to pursue. And again, second, I have been a longtime supporter of legal aid to those who need it most. And in fact, for those of you who were on the council in 2016, you'll recall that I was the sponsor for the Legal Defense Fund to provide free attorneys to those facing deportation proceedings based on clear eligibility criteria.  I took myself up. So I have been a longtime supporter of making sure that we have supports and legal counsel in these really difficult legal proceedings where there is clear positional power. And I'm excited for the opportunity for the city of Seattle to finally pursue a right to counsel.  opportunity and I'm appreciative for the efforts that are allowing us to do so. So I'm gonna support this motion to hold simply on the procedural aspects  I will commit to holding an executive session on Monday, March 22nd, and that will, I think, allow us plenty of opportunity to resolve some of the issues that have been flagged in this conversation today by Monday, March 29th. I do want to say that I have had an opportunity to look at  some legal memorandums that do raise significant concerns about the bill in the form that it currently exists in. And I do think there is an opportunity for us to address those concerns while still fulfilling the underlying intent of this bill, which is to provide those who need it the most free legal counsel in these eviction proceedings. So I do think the bill  and the individuals we are seeking to help would be best served by an additional two weeks to resolve those concerns. So I'm looking forward to that work over the next couple of weeks to get this over the finish line and join many of the other cities who have already done this before us, certainly before the pandemic, and look forward to that work. Okay.  Now call on Councilmember Sawant, and then Councilmember Peterson, you're the sponsor of the original motion to hold, so you'll have the final last word.

We had warned the movement, in fact, that there will be either a move to delay it or a move to insert loopholes, and I believe that the two are interrelated, but I'll speak to that in a second. I just wanted to respond to some of the points that have come up.  When Council Member Juarez says that she's concerned about eligibility requirements and she's not talking about means testing, I just want to make it clear to everybody who's listening, members of the public, that's one and the same thing. Don't fall for semantics. Eligibility requirements is means testing, in other words. It's just different words to describe  putting up systemic obstacles to, one, either keep people who should qualify from actually being able to qualify, or two, to make the process so arduous and onerous so that people who actually qualify also find it hard  to get access to the services for various reasons. Overwhelming statistical evidence shows that any kind of illegitimate, whether you want to call it illegitimate requirements or means testing, it's one of the same thing, regardless of the facts of what, regardless of the words you use when you're a politician,  In effect, if you set up barriers for accessing assistance that is meant for the very people who are absolutely down and out in circumstances and need that service at that moment because they have lost all other options to be able to pay their rent, which is what the data shows. It's not well-off people, let alone rich people who are affected by evictions. It is very, very vulnerable households that are affected by eviction. We don't need any kinds of tests.  I don't care how reasonable a tone a politician uses, the substance of what they're saying is if they put that into action in the law, if they insert that language into the law, in effect, it will prevent many households from accessing that service. That's just plain and simple. That is what the facts are.  question how seriously we are to take all these serious sounding arguments from Council Member Juarez. Council Member Juarez, you're a member of the committee. You did not attend any of the committees where we discussed this legislation. You have not responded to my office when we repeatedly asked, did you have questions? Did you have concerns? But as far as Council Members  other than Council Member Peterson, who has already voted no on the legislation, so we know where he stands. But other than Council Members Peterson and Juarez, I'm hearing progressive Democrats who are also saying that they will vote yes to delay the vote. If you are genuinely wanting the strongest possible bill for renters and delaying it just as a procedural vote, okay, let's take your word for it for a second. I don't agree with postponing. When tenants ask landlords for a delay in eviction, what happens to them?  They don't get a delay. They don't have council members at their site saying, hey, landlord, please delay the eviction. The truth is they get evicted. So I don't agree with the postponing. And in my view, this supposed sort of delay just to be careful and just to have a well-crafted legislation or a procedural vote, in my view, is a signal to tenants that the establishment cares more about corporate landlords than tenants who are desperate and getting evicted every day. In fact, right now,  Renters are being evicted. Again, as I said, it's not hyperbole. To delay the protections is actually a bad thing, even by a few weeks, because renters are still being evicted during the moratorium at the rate of one a day. So there is one family being devastated every day in order to  you know, satisfy a system that supports corporate landlords. However, having said all that, let's lay all that aside. If it is genuinely a desire to have clarifications, fine. Then let's vote on this and let's make sure, vote on this in two weeks and let's make sure that it's a strong bill.  to respond to the council members who have said, let's make it stronger. I don't understand what that means. And that's completely dishonest. This is a strong bill. How will you make it stronger? Yes, you can add some whereas clauses or recitals as council member Lewis was saying, I'm not opposed to that. Fine, let's do it. But as far as the substance of the bill is concerned, like what would the law actually do? It is already very strong. My suspicion is that you're delaying it because you want to make it weaker. And I will say, as far as the,  the idea that somehow the implication that somehow we haven't consulted with the city attorney's office enough and more needs to be done i don't agree with that we have done a thorough assessment alongside the city attorney's office they have some concerns about what's called gift of public funds and i don't know i don't blame the members of the public if you don't understand what i mean because it's very technical language but i just wanted to use that  Because I think that is one of the things that council members are referring to without actually referring to it. I wanted to quote Edmund Witter from the Housing Justice Project who found that whole idea ridiculous. And to quote him from an article that was published this morning in The Stranger, he said, quote, if the city funds a food bank and doesn't ask how much the shoppers make,  Is that a violation of the gift of public funds? In other words, what council members are going to do, and my comments are directed to people in the movement, is insert eligibility requirements or means testing because they will claim that somehow the city attorney's office or legally  They're not able to do it without means testing. That's not true. And as Edmund Witter, who's also an attorney himself with long experience of defending tenants from eviction, has found that idea ridiculous because why should that happen? And more and more renters rights have won and stood the test of the courts because ordinary people are fighting back.  And most of those laws actually have been from our movement and from my office. So the reason the council has been profoundly successful in passing renters' rights is because renters, working people, and socialists are getting organized. Last but not least, I want to warn members of the public and ordinary people, renters, union members, non-union workers, socialists who are fighting for renters' rights and for the right to counsel bill without loopholes.  I warn you, we cannot stop building this movement because we have to prevent this delay from being used as a means to push in means testing loopholes. In other cities, similar things happened. When the bills got weakened with means testing loopholes, it was when democratic politicians brought that forward.  If today progressive Democrats on the city council are saying they don't intend to put in bad loopholes, they just want some clarification, fine, let's hold them to it. And it is important that movement activists understand from what's happening today that we need to fight even harder. We cannot trust the rhetoric of politicians. We have to fight for what we need.

Really appreciate that. I do want to just note that the, it's important for us not to be dismissive of the realities around the prohibition on the gift of public funds. And I know that that is a hyper-technical term, but I also want to acknowledge that as  local government and elected officials, we are actually constitutionally required from avoiding a situation in which we are doing effectively a gift of public funds. And in short, that means doing a gift or lending money, property, or the entities credit to a private party that isn't ordinarily tied with exceptions in the constitution. And so  You know, whether we agree with that constitutional provision or not, it is in place, and we are required as elected officials to comply with those constitutional requirements.

Okay, public comment.  Colleagues, at this time, we will open the remote public comment period for the items on the City Council agenda, introduction, referral calendar, and the Council's work program. I want to thank everyone for their ongoing patience and cooperation as we continue to operate this remote public comment system. It remains the strong intent of the City Council to have remote public comment regularly included on meeting agendas.  However, as a reminder, the City Council reserves the right to end or eliminate these public comment periods at any point if we deem that the system is being abused or is no longer suitable for allowing our meetings to be conducted efficiently and effectively.  I'll moderate the public comment period in the following manner. Colleagues, as we all know, the public comment period for this meeting was scheduled to be 20 minutes, with each speaker being given two minutes to speak. We do have quite a volume of speakers signed up for public comment today, so I'm going to go ahead and extend the public comment period, but also adjust the amount of time that each individual has to address the council from two minutes to one minute.  So if there's no objection, the public comment period will be extended to 30 minutes. Hearing no objection, the public comment period is now extended to 30 minutes. Again, each speaker will be allowed one minute or 60 seconds to speak.  I will call on each speaker by name and in the order in which they registered on the council's website. If you've not yet registered to speak but would like to, you can sign up before the end of public comment by going to the council's website at seattle.gov forward slash council. The public comment link is also listed on today's agenda. Once I call a speaker's name, staff will unmute the appropriate microphone and the speaker is going to hear a prompt of you have been unmuted.  When the speaker hears that prompt, that means it's their turn to press star six to begin speaking. So again, you have to hit star six, not pound six, but star six in order for us to be able to hear you after you've heard the prompt if you have been unmuted. Please begin speaking by stating your name and the item that you are addressing. As a reminder, public comment should relate to an item on today's agenda, the introduction referral calendar, or the council's work program.  Speakers are going to hear a chime at about 10 seconds. That means that you have 10 seconds left before you need to wrap up your comments. And if you do not wrap up your comments by the end of 60 seconds, your microphone is going to be muted to allow us to call on the next speaker. Once you've completed your public comment, we'd ask that you please disconnect from the line. And if you plan to continue following this meeting, you can do so on Seattle Channel or the listening options listed on the agenda.  The public comment period is now going to be open. It is 2.55 p.m., so we will go until 3.25.

The idea of introducing means testing or eligibility requirements, which is the same thing, is absolutely ridiculous. People who are facing eviction are already a means tested group. If you have money, you're not going to find yourself facing an eviction notice. The argument that people making $100,000 a year would abuse the system is absurd. Means testing would only hurt to serve black renters, women renters, parents, and children.  Moreover, I find it incredibly hypocritical that council members claim to be concerned about the cost of this legislation, but had no problem approving a $370 million police budget.

At the forum, after the forum and after the interviews with the CPC, the CPC chose to appoint Interim Director Grant as the permanent executive director of the CPC.  Interim Director Grant comes to us with a whole lot of experience working with community, including over 20 years of mental health and community programming in Washington State and seven years of experience working with community in Seattle, applying her mental health expertise to policy and programming, addressing gun violence in our communities. She's dedicated to improving the Seattle Police Department's relationship with the community and ensuring that the voices of the most impacted are heard in the discussion about policing.  She served as a commissioner on the CPC and interim director before being nominated to the position. She's becoming the interim executive director. Interim Director Grant has led the CPC during unprecedented times with police accountability being at the forefront of a national conversation. During her tenure, she has already seen the completion of a significant amount of work.  including recommendation statements on crowd control weapons for consideration of the consent decree monitor and the court, in addition to Seattle Police Department's use of force policies and the collective bargaining process for the new Seattle Police Department contract negotiations. She's also streamlined the process for tracking  recommendations made by the CPC and overseeing the creation of a recommendation tracker for recommendations being made to the police department and accountability partners. Over the last year, she's brought on a new policy team and led the commission into new areas of advocacy with the development of an independent state legislative agenda.  for the CPC, and I use this as a template myself to include items, to advocate for items to be included in the city's state legislative agenda that was adopted by council. Her tenure has brought about a new energy in the CPC office as she's developed new staff and commissioner onboarding and professional coaching processes.  And she is in the process of developing an internship program to mentor the next generation of leaders in this field. All of this is impressive, but where Ms. Grant truly excels is in her ability to engage with the community and build relationships across the city to ensure that the CPC is representing the broader community.

First, just a little bit of process background. Members of the Public Safety and Human Services Committee probably remember that the Human Services Director, Helen Howell, and her team presented a brief overview on this work at the January 26th committee meeting. And following that presentation, Director Howell responded more fully to questions that were developed in a memo from committee members.  and shared on February 18th.  The Human Services Department released the Requests for Proposals related to this funding on March 1st. And this Requests for Proposals is available on the Human Services Department Funding Opportunity webpage. And on March 4th, my office sent out to committee members the central staff memo describing the legislation and the new memo from Dr. Howe with more details about the work leading up to and creating the RFP.  Public Safety and Human Services Committee members voted this legislation out of committee unanimously last week. And to talk a little bit about what the legislation is all about. Last year during the budget process, we responded calls from community to invest in alternatives to policing.  and made an effort to forward funding that we had dedicated during the summer rebalancing process. So as we now observe one year anniversary since the death of Brianna Taylor at the hands of police, it's clear that these calls must be heated and that this work is as urgent now as it was last year.  City Council answered that call by upgrading 16 million to invest in community-led organizations that are creating community safety on the ground every day in Seattle.  And last year, the Human Services Department moved quickly to award $4 million of the $16 million to the Seattle Community Safety Initiative. And these are funds that are working to build community safety hubs and wraparound services in three Seattle neighborhoods under the leadership of Community Passageways. We've been collectively urging the executive to expedite this portion of investment. Our community has been waiting  to receive this investment since council first voted to approve it last summer. Legislation before the council today lifts a proviso on the fund, which requires that council by ordinance a spend plan organized within the intercept model submitted by the human services department.  Public Safety and Human Services Committee members heard a presentation from the Human Services Department on that same plan last week and unanimously voted the legislation out of committee. The new investment will bring together a cohort of organizations dedicated to reimagining how safety can be achieved in Seattle and the resources they need to lead the way in creating safety in our city. This is exactly the kind of investment recommended in a recent report by the 14 members of the National Commission  on COVID-19 and criminal justice to combat increased violence and property offenses across the country. It will move the city's community safety strategy towards a public health-centered harm reduction model of restorative justice and crime prevention while ameliorating harm caused by the criminal legal system.

In the past year, small businesses have been hurt badly by COVID-19, the pandemic era restrictions, and our economic recession. Too many businesses have been forced to shut their doors for good. And this past year has also shown us how creative and nimble business owners, entrepreneurs, and innovators  can be when they're faced with these challenges. And we know that the land use code was not written for life in a pandemic and the land use code has not kept up with our changing environment, especially when we're doing more than ever from our homes. Council President Gonzales, Council Member Mosqueda, and I all introduced bringing business home to provide small business owners and entrepreneurs  entrepreneurs with the flexibility they need for these challenging times. Bringing business home will make it easier to open or operate a home-based business for the next year, time-limited year, by easing some of the onerous code restrictions on these small businesses. Home-based businesses are still regulated by other levels of government and public entities such as Department of Health, Liquor Control Board, City of Seattle, Department of FAS,  The state, there are many, many, many layers of government still regulating businesses and specifically for businesses that occupy either in food or in beverage or in healthcare. This does not change any of those regulatory or licensure oversights.  as well as there would still be many requirements of home-based businesses, including they must be operated by a resident of the home, that the business will be clearly accessory, so secondary to the main use of the home as residents, that the commercial deliveries are limited to one per day and on weekdays early. And I can tell you some of my neighbors get more in Amazon than that. Just again, that's an aside. Lastly, it's also very important to understand that  Home occupancy businesses still must abide by the noise odor light or smoke impacts that are currently written in the code that they cannot be noticeable beyond the property. By now also you've heard the story of yonder cider and Greenwood, which was forced to close after they were found in violation of current code again when.  Yonder brought their situation to my attention with colleagues as well, I'm sure. What opened my eyes is that we have many different businesses, home occupancy businesses operating in the community that are not operating to the letter of the code and could be shut down.  If they were cited again once a citation is in the queue, it cannot be undone even by the person that submitted that citation and that again is why we need to play, create this level playing field and why we need to provide this time limited flexibility as an exception to the norm. This bill is  more than just about yonder. It's about the opportunity to start and grow a business that can soon fill a vacant storefront down the block or by giving a struggling small business the chance to move home for the moment to weather the storm and then come back  in full bloom in our business districts. Some of the most successful businesses in the world were founded in garages. I heard about one at committee last week that sounds very delicious. Now it is time for the city to make life easier for these entrepreneurs. Rather than shutting down the small businesses that make up the fabric of our community, we must make our neighborhoods, our land use code should not be a barrier to making our neighborhoods more vibrant and having a strong economy.  Thank you, Council President. Thank you, Council Member Mosqueda, for partnering with me on this effort and for everyone who has helped get this bill along, including V. Nguyen and Noah Ahn.

As discussed this morning, this amendment would not prohibit automotive sales or services. It would prohibit, as is now the case, a substantial increase in vehicle traffic or parking. The amendment would also prohibit a drive-in or drive-through type of business.

I really appreciate the Council's consideration of this bill today as amended. Happy to be a co-sponsor. Thank you very much, Council Member Strauss and Council President. I know you've been working on this for a while and very excited to be part of the team.  As we get this over the finish line, to me, this is really about what's good for economic resiliency of Seattle. And as you think about how many people have lost their job, their employment prior to the pandemic and folks who are being innovative and creative. I talked to Ventures just last week to hear more about how, you know, some of our smallest businesses are faring during this time.  And what I heard is that many entrepreneurs are doing everything they can to try to be innovative and change their business strategies so that they can survive. And allowing for this type of code change is really critical right now as people think about either opening a business for the first time or modifying the type of businesses that they had originally engaged in and doing it in a way that actually reaches people where they're at right now. People are staying home.  They're staying in their neighborhoods, they're staying in their local communities, and they're walking more and making it more accessible for people to be able to purchase goods and services in their neighborhood, allow for those entrepreneurs to be able to open the front of their shops or their garages and be able to sell to the pedestrians and the bikers and potentially the folks who are going through the neighborhood as they...  get out and start to enjoy spring and hopefully are vaccinated and actually get a chance to walk around our neighborhoods more. This is an economic stimulus bill. I think it's important to reiterate what we talked about last week as well. This is not just about helping those entrepreneurs who need additional assistance and helping to cut through the red tape. This is also about how we create more dollars in the pockets of residents across the city who are then able to spend that money  in existing local businesses. This is not going to be a detriment to existing small businesses. In fact, this has a multiplier effect that is beneficial. Every time we allow for there to be more finances, for more financial stability for residents in the city, it pays forward.  People spend that money in local shops and in local restaurants and vendors. So this is truly one small way, a very important way for us to help our smallest employers and future entrepreneurs in the city. And whether that's the next Microsoft or the next Tasty Tacos or what have you, and I still want that fry bread, Council Member Juarez, I think it's really important that we're making these changes today  Because I don't think anyone could argue that having to do appointment only and not more than two people working for the vendor and not having signage on the street, that that is not a good way to start a business. So we're making it easier for folks to do that. And we're also addressing the traffic concerns, I think, appropriately in this bill.  I want to thank again the Council President's staff and Council Member Strauss' staff and my staff. Andrew Houston did a lot of work and research on this bill. So thank you very much for the ongoing work. And part of that research as we thought about the ways that we clear curbsides to make more opportunities for folks to be able to see small businesses was to think about how this isn't just about access to parking in front of businesses. This is about how do we make it a more walkable, thriving and vibrant neighborhood.  Looking forward to what we can do to learn from this experience in the long run. I think this is an important interim measure, and I think that there's a lot to be gained from this as we think about creating resiliency in the out years. Look forward to working with all of you and looking forward to passing this.

I am really excited about this bill, so I want to thank Councilmember Strauss for the work that you've been doing to bring this forward. I think it really speaks to the fact that we need to fundamentally change the way we offer  opportunity to our neighbors. We know that micro-businesses play an important role in generating income for some families. In my previous life, I provided technical assistance to food-based businesses who were trying to get started, trying to expand, and very often these are  Shops that are owned by just family members. There aren't a lot of employees. It is mom and pop, maybe one or two of the kids. And it is very important revenue that they are bringing in for their families. Through that process, I learned how hard it is for these family businesses  to expand into brick and mortar. Commercial space is often too big for some of these very small startups or too expensive or the tenant improvements that would be required are cost prohibitive. So we have a lot of work to do to make it easier for those who  don't have easy access to capital to get their foot in the door into entrepreneurship and to supporting their families and really expanding the kinds of goods and services that we're able to offer in our community. And I think this is a really important first step to make sure that that happens. So I look forward to what we can learn through this process.

Are there any additional comments on the bill? Okay, I'd like to make some comments on the bill as well. I am really enthusiastic about being able to support this legislative effort in partnership with Councilmember Strauss and also with the support of Councilmember Mosqueda. I, too, want to thank Noah Ahn and Vy Nguyen  My office, NOAA from your office gets member stress for all the hard work that they've done on this legislation, both in terms of reaching out to impacted small business owners, but also the good policy work that they've done on behalf of our offices. And big thanks to Cato Freeman as well for all of his good work in this space as well. I believe that this bill is going to be just one of many strategies that will help us with our economic recovery from COVID-19.  We know that we need flexibility and innovation, and this is local government meeting innovation happening on the ground by our entrepreneurs who want to try out ideas and provide needed income for their households. This bill will help lower barriers like access to capital or commercial affordability that keep many women and BIPOC entrepreneurs in particular from starting a business.  The Bringing Business Home bill will strengthen neighborhoods and get us closer to complete neighborhoods with amenities for Seattle residents and families. At a time when it's not just important to support our local small business to ensure they'll still be with us on the other side of the pandemic, it's also important to create flexibility and options that will help entrepreneurs during this period of time. This bill will help lower barriers like access to capital to keep many, especially BIPOC entrepreneurs and women from starting a business.  With many out of work during a pandemic, this change can help Seattle residents start a small business to add much needed income to their household. This will only help us to get that much closer to economic recovery while adding vibrancy and amenities to our neighborhoods. In addition, this bill helps us get to better connected neighborhoods, which means we don't need to go far when services and amenities are within a 10 to 15 minute walk or bike ride.  This bill means that it will be easier for people to start their dream of being a small business owner and help us get back to a city of vibrant small businesses all across the city. It will support innovation and provide a pathway for people to build their business clientele and grow capital in hand for their business. We want every single business to grow out of their garage and into a storefront. You need a lot of money to do that and this bill  allows businesses to build at home first before they can take the next big step. And lastly, the reality is that our neighborhoods are the center of our universe as this pandemic continues. And while we recover, this bill will allow us to continue to limit our travel outside of our homes to stay safer under pandemic protocols by increasing amenities right in our backyard.  So I'm really excited about this bill. And I know that there's been some conversation about the need to ensure that this is not too broad of a legislative fix. I don't think it's too broad of a legislative fix, as Council Member Strauss likes to correctly remind us. This is a narrow bill to address a narrow issue within the structure and the context of the land use bill. I did want to take an opportunity to read  Two testimonials into the record from impacted small business owners. The first is from Caitlin Brand. We've heard of Caitlin a lot these days. She is the founder of Yonder Cider. And she is a big supporter of Council Bill 12001, which we are calling the Bringing Business Home Bill. And she wrote to us just this afternoon.  Quote, in August 2020, I launched Yonder Bar, our retail-to-go-only space in my garage. We launched in the time of COVID, and when launching a full tasting room with a five- to seven-year commercial lease was not possible for us. Launching in my garage allowed for the incubation of our business, helped us to determine its viability, and eventually to the signing of a commercial lease just last month. I hope this bill allows this opportunity for so many other hopeful small business owners.  In the past week alone, I have received calls, emails, and messages from more than a dozen people who, like me, have dreamed of opening their business only to be faced with hurdle after hurdle. I believe this bill will open opportunities for small businesses across the city now and into the future. And in my opinion, this bill doesn't take away from people signing commercial leases. It makes them possible.  Furthermore, since the comments at the last Land Use Committee, I have gone into my local community to talk to business owners on Greenwood Avenue. From those who I talk to, they welcome businesses like Yonder Bar because what they see is more traffic coming to their neighborhood, to the neighborhood, more potential exposure to their business, and more connected, vibrant communities. That benefits everyone. Many of these businesses also carry our products now and see growing sales with the existence and exposure of Yonder Bar.  Launching on our garage made our big dreams possible, and we hope this bill will allow the same for others. That's testimony from Caitlin, who is the founder and president of Yonder Cider, and I want to thank her for her support and for really important comments on this legislation. A second constituent wrote to our office the following about this bill.  I'm a voter in District 2 and the owner of Emerald City Flowers. I started Emerald City Flowers during the pandemic as a part-time job to bring joy to people during this difficult time with the pandemic and gain additional income. I'm writing in support of the Home Occupation Bill. During the pandemic, many businesses had to close their storefronts. People were laid off from their jobs, had their hours reduced, hiring freezes, and freezes on salary increases.  However, cost of living remains high in Seattle. Small business owners and residents need to have more avenues to gain income, and this legislation can help make that possible. Current land use laws around operating a business without your home are too restrictive, including having customers schedule appointment times, which doesn't work well for many business models selling goods and services. During this time, many people are at home thinking about how they want to spend their time and what they want to do. For some, that is starting a new business or venture.  Our local economy and small business owners have been devastated by the COVID-19 pandemic. By suspending some of these restrictive conditions, it will enable more small businesses to operate and thrive. Seattle is a city of innovation. Many successful businesses were started out of someone's garage. Passing this legislation will help existing and new small businesses as well as aid the economic recovery of the COVID-19 pandemic with a more vibrant small business ecosystem.  So I will conclude my comments there. I think those are two really great testimonials from the north to the south end of our city and look forward to being able to continue to support this legislative effort. So that being said, I want to give Councilmember Strauss the last word before we call the roll on this bill.", "start": 7662, "end": 8114, "Transition": "\"\"", "Meeting Section": "Other", "Speaker Role": "Other", "is_public_comment": 0, "is_public_hearing": 0, "is_comment_start_trigger": 0, "is_comment_end_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_start_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_end_trigger": 0}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_33", "text": "Thank you, Council President.

This is about incubating innovations and businesses to fill our vacant storefronts, as you just heard. In the case of Yonder, they used their money that they have raised from opening in their garage to fill a vacant storefront.  That is the trajectory that we were talking about, and their neighboring business association, the Finney Neighborhood Association, also expressed their support to me for this legislation. This bill is about being solution-oriented and creating outcomes for everyday Seattleites.  If you want to take a look at the last two committee meetings for some great questions, good conversation and more information on how narrow this bill is and what other government regulations and licensures are required beyond the land use code.

A little more than five years ago, Director Sam Acefa was nominated to be the first permanent director  the first ever of the Office of Planning and Community Development. Director Sefa came to us in Seattle with an impressive resume as a leader in community planning coming from Boulder, Chicago, and San Francisco. During his time in Seattle,  Director Assefa oversaw the implementation of mandatory housing affordability, led the creation of the Equitable Development Initiative, and provided steady planning leadership for one of the fastest growing cities in the United States. During his time, Seattle had the fastest growth in the nation, even outpacing New York City in terms of cranes and construction.  Director Assefa's final day with OPCD was this past Friday, and I want to take just a moment. I won't read the whole proclamation, and considering time, I do want to recognize the fact that Director Assefa is a nationally and internationally recognized leader in urban planning, bringing forward thinking and equitable approach to shaping our built environment.  And I guess, so that was a whereas Director Acefa. Other things that this proclamation states is whereas Director Acefa spearheaded implementation of equitable development initiative, which provides assistance and funding to community-based organizations and development,  projects that respond to displacement pressures and advance equity in historically marginalized communities. And whereas under Director Acefa's leadership, OPCD led the implementation of MHA, which will create thousands of desperately needed affordable housing units in Seattle and has already raised more than $66 million for affordable housing.  And while Director Acefa helped establish the criteria for mutually offsetting benefit property transfers in response to community, which is allowed for the transfers of property like the Central Area Senior Center and Bird Bar Place in the Central District, this has also allowed for the preservation of many acres of farmland throughout the region and increased density here in Seattle.  And whereas Director Acefa attended Harvard University, Carnegie Mellon University, and the University of Illinois at Chicago, where he earned his Bachelor of Architecture, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he earned his Master of City Planning. And whereas in San Francisco, Director Acefa served as the Director of Special Projects for the Department of Planning and Development,  In Chicago, whereas in Chicago, Director Acefa was the Director of Land Use and Planning Policy for the Department of Planning and Development. And whereas in Boulder, Director Acefa served as the Senior Urban Planning Designer in the Department of Community Planning and Sustainability.  Director Acefa led transformational change here for the City of Seattle as Director of the Office of Planning and Community Development. It is with a heavy heart that I let you go. I have threatened many times to not conclude meetings to retain you here in the city. I just want to take this moment to recognize you, Director Acefa, because I cannot thank you enough for your service to our city and directing us through some of the most incredible growth since the gold rush  Your fingerprints on our built environment are incredibly meaningful, and we could not have done this without you.

And that we should plan towards the understanding that displacement occurs in our city and that that  part of growth is the inevitable displacement impacts associated with that growth. So not only for as it relates to the development of the Equitable Development Initiative, but also a recognition that in our efforts,  to increase development capacity and our efforts to increase funding for the mandatory housing affordability program, but that we have to, in our zoning, recognize that there can be displacement-related impacts.

I have appreciated that wide-eyed reflection of the impacts to low-income communities of color that are often associated  with development and growth.

It has been a leader in a very short time around the country  And to be part of that has been one of the greatest honor of my professional career. I accept a lot of the accolade around my accomplishments, but know clearly that it was  an incredible staff that we built over the last few years that actually has done the work and ideas. A lot of the praise that we get for EDI, most of you in this room have been working on that for years. And the community groups that have actually put our feet to the fire is the reason why that program has succeeded, that the team has done an incredible work around some of the most difficult times  whether it's the mandatory housing affordability, very contentious,  issue going through a pandemic last year and then having built an incredible program with an Office of Planning and Community Development is literally took a village to do that. I'm also very grateful of Seattle and the two mayors who appointed me and previously and my current boss, Mayor Durkan as well to actually give me that opportunity. Seattle  I compared notes with many of my peers around the country, 35 planning directors. Seattle has been looked at, especially over the last few years on equity issues, on climate issues and in planning issues because of the work all of you have done here.  Planning is a contact sport and where it is most contentious is where people really care about their place. So Seattle is one of those places as well. It's because people care about it so much that it becomes such a hard job to do for all of you in this room as well.  If you didn't care about a place, it would be the easiest job for any planner anywhere. So for that reason, I think the city would still continue to be an example for the rest of the country.

I'll moderate the public comment period in the following manner.  Colleagues, the public comment period for this meeting was originally scheduled to be 20 minutes with each speaker being provided two minutes to speak. However, in reviewing the public comment signup sheet, I am noticing that we are up to approximately 52 individuals who are preregistered to speak. So I'd like to go ahead and  extend the public comment period to last up to 60 minutes with each person being provided one minute to speak. That should give us an opportunity to get through everyone today. So for those of you who called in today, please begin.  Pairing down your comments to one minute instead of two minutes. I do apologize for that, but we want to make sure that we have an opportunity to hear from all of those who signed up to speak and your cooperation on that front will help us achieve that.  I'll call on each speaker by name and in the order in which they registered on the council's website. If you've not yet registered to speak, but would like to, you can sign up before the end of public comment by going to council's website at seattle.gov forward slash council. The public comment link is also listed on today's agenda. Once I call a speaker's name, staff will unmute the appropriate microphone and an automatic prompt if you have been unmuted will be your cue as the speaker to press star six before you begin speaking.  Please begin by stating your name, the item that you are addressing, and the item that you are addressing. As a reminder, public comment should relate to an item on today's agenda, the introduction referral calendar, or the council's work program. Speakers are going to hear a chime around 10 seconds, and that means that you have 10 seconds left of the allotted time of your one minute. So again, you're going to hear a chime.  when you have about 10 seconds left of your allotted time. And at that point, we'd ask that you begin to wrap up your public comments. If you don't end your comments by the end of the one minute, your microphone is gonna be muted so we can call on the next person. Once you've completed your public comment, we ask that you please disconnect from the line. And if you plan to continue following this meeting, you can do so on Seattle Channel or any one of the listening options listed on the agenda.  So colleagues, public comment period is now open. We'll begin with the first speaker on the list. Again, when I call your name, you're going to hear you have been unmuted and then you have to press star six in order for us to be able to hear you. So the first two speakers are Kate Rubin, followed by Beatrice Lacombe.

There is a massive power imbalance between renters and landlords. 90% of landlords have legal representation in an eviction court compared to only 10% of renters. Before the pandemic even began, 47% of Seattle tenants were rent burdened, spending more than a third of our income on rent.  Due to Seattle's racist housing history, low-income black and indigenous people of color are more likely to be renters and they're the first to be displaced. Being forced to prove economic hardship will make it even more challenging for renters to access this service. Without adequate representation, how will they defend themselves? Many tenants already self-evict because they feel like it's their only option. Giving people facing eviction fair representation and support will ultimately help to keep them housed and save lives.

The way to level the uneven playing field favoring landlords is to make sure that all tenants have legal counsel by passing this bill and passing it without means testing. No one under the duress of fighting an eviction should be humiliated by having to declare their indigent. Evictions lead to homelessness. Nicholsville has a long waiting list of people who want to move into one of its self-managed tiny house villages. In fact, we've had to turn away people for nearly all our 12 years of operations.

The vast majority of people who face eviction are not wealthy enough to support themselves in the legal battle. A lot of those people end up facing homelessness.  Even if you're offering free counsel, when you insert extra steps in the process, people who are already struggling to survive will fall through the cracks. If you're facing eviction, you're focused on finding money, taking care of your family, and scrambling to put a roof over your head for the next week. You may not be able to quickly produce proof of income, and this vital service will end up being underutilized. It'll keep out the people it's meant to serve. Please pass this important bill today with no means testing or other loopholes. We can continue strengthening renter protections and prevent homelessness.

People facing eviction clearly are unable to afford an attorney. They wouldn't be in this position of being evicted if they could. Adding means testing is going to prevent those who need it most from receiving aid. I also heard that there's a secret amendment out there on the table. It's an excuse to make right to counsel not actually right because it's subject to appropriation. This is absolutely shameful to strip this literally life-saving protection with a sneaky amendment.  It's going to cost a fraction of what the city spends on the police budget to provide counsel and actually has the potential to save the city millions of dollars through people not being displaced. You know, it's been through the strength of the movement that Maximus, Tenants Union, Socialist Alternative, Beat Seattle, and a bunch of other people, I know a lot of people on the call have been from these groups, that we have this on the table.

Every eviction is an act of violence, an act of violence against the renters who are traumatized and displaced, suddenly forced into daily survival mode. Many evictions are a blow against children who are forced to move away from schools and friends and against the adults who are forced away from community and social support systems.  Every eviction adds to our community's misery and suffering, and it accelerates racist gentrification. This bill would guarantee the right to counsel, that is, a right to a lawyer, to any renter in Seattle facing eviction. In other words, if your landlord attempts to evict you, you have the right to a lawyer being with you, defending you in court, just like people have the right to an attorney if they're accused of a crime.  This bill commits the city of Seattle to contract for all the legal representation needed so that eviction defense attorneys can defend every renter without exception facing eviction who needs the help. Before the pandemic, about 1,200 renters in Seattle faced eviction every year. Even during the pandemic, with the moratorium in place, landlords have filed more than 300 eviction cases with the court as they are exploiting loopholes in the moratorium.  Many more tenants than can be officially measured on top of that are constantly evicted from their homes when landlords threaten to evict because tenants are understandably intimidated when they get an eviction notice because they know that the eviction system in Seattle is completely stacked against them. And they just move out and undertake greater precariousness in housing in order to avoid the whole experience  of going to court or not going to court and getting evicted. This is especially true for black community members who are given eviction notices at three times the rates for other tenants.  Without this right to counsel legislation, we can expect a tsunami of evictions once the city and state moratoriums expire, as renters will still be struggling under the double blows of the capitalist recession and the COVID health crisis and will be burdened with debt. And this legislation will not be enough by itself. We will need a lot more. We know that eviction destroys communities, wrecks households, and even kills.  The 2018 report, Losing Home, the Human Cost of Eviction in Seattle, found that 87.5%, nearly 9 out of 10 renters who are evicted, end up homeless. In their study of 2017 evictions, the authors of the report, the Seattle Women's Commission and the King County Bar Association, found that some tenants even died shortly after being evicted.  According to the eviction lab at Princeton University, despite the pandemic and the eviction moratoriums, landlords have filed 272,612 evictions since March last year in just the 27 cities that the eviction lab has been tracking. Growing evidence, they say, shows that more and more evictions are not driven by so-called mom and pop landlords struggling to balance their personal checkbooks.  Since the CDC eviction moratoriums took effect last September, evictions by corporate landlords have actually been steadily increasing. Research by the Private Equity Stakeholders Project, a research and advocacy organization, has tracked nearly 50,000 evictions by corporate landlords in select counties in six states since the beginning of September last year and found that corporate landlords are responsible for the majority and sometimes the overwhelming majority of evictions.  Seattle is no exception to this. Major corporate landlords are the main evictors in our city. The most evicting landlord in 2019 was Goodman Real Estate, a corporation with $2.5 billion, that is billion with a B, worth of property holdings in the US and Canada. Other major evictors include regional giant Epic Asset Management and national landlord Kona Management Corporation. The American Civil Liberties Union found that nationally,  90% of landlords are represented in eviction code, while only 10% of tenants are. Can you imagine as a struggling tenant facing eviction, perhaps because you just lost your low wage job, going up against the likes of attorneys from Goodman Real Estate?  Our right to counsel legislation will give these tenants at least a fighting chance in court when they have to go up against these greedy corporate landlords and their greedy lawyers. And the impact from the right to counsel, as we have seen in cities around the country that have passed similar legislation, is absolutely astounding.  With a lawyer, far fewer people are evicted. This is because unjust evictions are overturned in court, and it is because eviction defense attorneys can and do help connect people with social services when they are needed. The Housing Justice Project in Seattle, for example, works closely with Homebase, which administers rental assistance funds so that they can help people pay their back rent and then present that to a judge to prevent the eviction.  Statistically, even for people who are ultimately evicted, having an attorney still improves the outcomes with renters saddled with less crushing debts.  All of this is not the end of the story. It is also because when there is a universal right for lenders to have a trained attorney with them in court, that gives corporate landlords pause from issuing eviction notices in the first place. In New York, the rate of eviction filings dropped by a stunning 30% since their right to counsel legislation passed because landlords now know that they can no longer use the courts to bully renters who have no legal help. They're going to go up against a trained attorney.  These are all the primary reasons to support the right to counsel because of the human impact of evictions on renters and the progressive outcome overall for our society by reducing housing instability and homelessness, not to mention the racial component of this, giving universal right to counsel is a Black Lives Matter issue.  But even through the narrow lens of the city's finances, the right to counsel is sensible. The Housing Justice Project, for example, has estimated that guaranteeing the right to counsel will cost approximately $750,000 in a normal year. And by a normal year, I mean a year without an eviction moratorium.  Compare that to the cost of the courts and the sheriff carrying out an eviction and the cost of homeless services because nine out of 10 evicted people become homeless. It is orders of magnitude more expensive not to pass universal right to counsel.  I appreciate the co-sponsorship of council members Lewis and Morales, and I urge all council members to support this legislation without watering it down with one loophole or another loophole. It is essential to defend the rights of renters in Seattle by offering universal right to counsel for all renters who need legal assistance.

And so this amendment would require that the providers providing the service include this information as a report, as required by the contract, and inform the counsel in the future about whether further legislative changes need to be made to address any issues that could be brought on by a future increase in the need for representation throughout the period of a longer trial.", "start": 5419, "end": 5527, "Transition": "\"\"", "Meeting Section": "Other", "Speaker Role": "Other", "is_public_comment": 0, "is_public_hearing": 0, "is_comment_start_trigger": 0, "is_comment_end_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_start_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_end_trigger": 0}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_20", "text": "Thank you, Council Member Herbold.

The motion carries. The amendment is adopted, and the bill now includes Amendment 2 as well. So I'm going to go ahead and move now to Amendment 3, which is my amendment. I move to amend Council Bill 1, 2,  0007 as presented on Amendment 3 on the agenda. Is there a second? Second. Thank you so much. It's been moved and seconded to amend the bill as presented on Amendment 3. I will, as sponsor of the amendment, address it, and then we will open the floor for additional comments and discussion of the amendment. Colleagues, as I mentioned this morning during council briefing,  I was interested in pursuing an amendment that accomplished two things. One, that made the bill legally defensible and a more workable bill.  that would actually bring to fruition the right to counsel to those tenants who need it the most. And secondarily, I have a strong interest in supporting this policy and ensuring access to legal aid for those tenants who need it the most. And so my office pursued this particular amendment, which accomplishes  A few simple things. So first of all, this bill adds a recital to acknowledge that the council has an intent to minimize as many barriers as possible to accessing council for those who need it. Second, Amendment 3 establishes that any tenant residing in Seattle has the right to legal counsel free of charge if the tenant meets a simple indigency standard.  This indigency standard is modeled on the same standard utilized in the Immigrant Legal Defense Fund, which was unanimously adopted by the City Council in 2016. The definition of indigency focuses on the inability to afford an attorney at any point during an unlawful detainer lawsuit. Third, this amendment allows the contracted legal service providers to establish the process and manner by which to verify indigency.  This is a common practice that is similar to the steps taken by service providers in other circumstances, such as the self-certification process that was approved in the COVID-19 Eviction Defense Bill last year. In that example, the tenant simply needs to sign a form at their appearance in eviction court  that could be as simple as saying, I cannot afford an attorney and then signing that form and being therefore immediately eligible for receiving free legal aid. So we are not talking about a process by which  by which a tenant is going to have to present a mountain full of paperwork in order to prove that they're indigent. It is as simple as the process that we currently have in place for the Legal Defense Fund, which is a self attestation or certification that you indeed cannot pay for your own attorney in this unlawful detainer action. I believe this is very simple. I believe that most individuals who  need the access to legal aid are going to be able to easily, simply, and in collaboration with legal service providers who have a strong interest in providing legal services to those individuals is going to be able to accomplish the council's underlying policy goals here of making sure that we have access to legal aid for those who need it the most. So again, I believe that this language is  is going to minimize legal risks of having this law survive a legal challenge, which again, I believe is almost going to certainly happen, while also providing access to a right to counsel to those that need it. This amendment, again, as a reminder, is modeled after the Immigrant Legal Defense Fund that the City Council unanimously passed in 2016. In that case, we also included an indigent standard  And again, in the three years of existence, the Deportation Defense Fund has helped hundreds of immigrants and refugees fighting deportation proceedings while having no administrative burden or chilling effect on those seeking services as a result of the indigent standard and the self-certification.  process in that context. Again, this was unanimously supported by the city council at the time in the legal defense funds. So I would today ask for your support in voting in favor of Amendment 3. All right. We have some comments here. So we're going to open up the floor. First up is Councilmember Herbold, followed by Councilmember Morales. Councilmember Herbold.  You're not on mute, actually.

All right. Well, thank you, Council President Gonzalez, for bringing forward this amendment to make this bill stronger. This amendment is not an example of means testing. Legal services providers can simply ask renters to sign a statement that they are eligible for this service, and after doing so, they are immediately entitled to representation. There is no test.  for anyone to have to produce documents and wait for the test to be graded. It is not means testing. Means testing is a method for determining whether someone qualifies for financial assistance to obtain a service or good  And it looks at the means or monetary resources that that individual has available to them to pay for a particular service or good.

Just one person receiving a free attorney when they have sufficient funds to pay for an attorney could bring the hard-earned right to counsel law down. I do not want to take that risk.  This amendment ensures that the greatest number and those most in need are eligible to receive assistance when facing eviction with the most minimal of requirements. I've seen data that means testing can be a barrier to services. I have not seen any data that a self-attestation of poverty is a barrier to services.

I believe the right to counsel should be universally available for those who need it. Just because it has been a standard used in a previous legislation is not a good enough reason to reproduce it in this legislation.  Council members may not want to call it means testing. You can call it happy joy testing if you want, but it is still means testing in reality. It is asking people to go through us, you know, some kind of hoop, jump through some kind of hoop before they qualify.  People should be able to have universal rights. I also do not agree with the idea that this amendment makes the legislation, quote unquote, legally defensible. Eviction defense attorneys themselves have made it very clear that such amendments are not needed to make this legislation legally defensible. At the end of the day,  What makes any law passed strong, progressive law passed strong against legal challenges by corporations, by the wealthy, by corporate landlords is a fighting united movement of working people, renters and everyone who wants to have and live in an affordable and just city.  The right to have a lawyer to prevent eviction should be available for every renter facing eviction, just like all the best public services. There is no means test to use the public roads. They are available for everyone. There is no means test for public education or for the fire department.  There is no means just to use the lights of the streetlights. Federally, social security is available to everyone, rich and poor. And because of that, it has endured for 86 years, almost a century, despite repeated attempts to dismantle it by the ruling class, both Republican and Democratic administrations. And because these crucial public services are not means tested, nobody is shamed or humiliated for using them.  Across the spectrum of social services, any means testing, even the least invasive aspects or types, has the effect of preventing some of the most vulnerable people from using the service. Let's be clear. The reason this means testing amendment from city council Democrats is not as bad or invasive or onerous as it could have been is because the renters rights and socialist activist movement who organized to  when this legislation said loudly that we oppose means testing and we voiced our position in a unified manner, which made our collective voice so powerful. I wanted to say thank you to BC Seattle, Tenants Union, Socialist Alternative, the ACLU, the Housing Justice Project, Real Change, Transit Riders Union, and many others for speaking against any kind of means testing. We saw that organizing in public comment today  which has made it very clear the harm that means testing can do and has exposed the light of day attempts by Democrats to bring far worse amendments. However, even when the process of applying is not onerous, people are hesitant about using any kind of means tested services because, as I said, they feel humiliated or they are not sure they are eligible or they have misconceptions about how difficult the application will be.  The reality of eviction code in King County, as 13 organizations have pointed out in their letter, shows that the eviction process in Washington makes the use of any kind of test unworkable. Unlike criminal proceedings, this is designed to be very quick and occur in as little as three weeks from the time a tenant misses a rental payment. Unlike a criminal proceeding, which is much longer and involves multiple court dates, most tenants have only one court date.  For that one court date, we should not, as a legislature, be putting any barriers, however less onerous, however less invasive.  Means testing has always been used politically by pro-big business politicians, both Republican and Democrat, for over 40 years to divide and conquer and make it easy to dismantle the programs or at least gut them in the future. One reason why Democratic former President Bill Clinton was able to destroy welfare in 1996 was because when it was set up in the first place decades before then, it was set up with means testing in the first place.  Throughout the existence of these means-tested programs, there have been wildly false rumors about people abusing them. These complete fabrications were used by Clinton, along with legislators of both political parties, to gut the welfare programs. The most important reason to reject this means-testing amendment is because of the missed opportunity to set a better precedent than has been set in the past. Council President Gonzalez referred to other means-tested services in Seattle and  We've heard this before, but this city council is populated by self-described progressive Democrats. There is one socialist. Rather than Seattle watering down local renter protections to match the concessions that are being made elsewhere or were made in the past,  My question is, why aren't progressive Democrats supporting the legislation without any watering down, without any means testing, however less invasive it may be, and then use that precedent to demand that legislators at Olympia, for example, follow suit and pass a strong law?  Finally, I want to also emphasize that all these allusions to legal concerns are not acceptable because, as I said, and I wanted to reiterate it, renters rights attorneys themselves have roundly rejected it. Renters rights attorneys want a bill that stands up in court. They are not in the business of wanting the legislature  like the city council, to pass laws that won't stand up in court. They absolutely want a bill to stand up in court. It is not in their interest to create any legal vulnerabilities, and they have strongly supported this legislation without any watering down.  The idea that means testing is necessary is an idea that is only ever foisted on the most vulnerable people in our society. Over the past couple of weeks, we have heard from community members many examples of programs to give handouts to the rich and powerful that have no means testing whatsoever, whether onerous or not. There is none.  There was no means test required for the Seattle Mariners to prove they needed financial support for their stadium. There was no means test for landlords to get compensation from the city through other legislation. There was no means test when the city paid tens of millions to the wealthy waterfront businesses to compensate the interruption of their sidewalk access during the seawall construction. There was no means test when the city invested almost half a billion rebuilding the streets around Mercer to accommodate Amazon's campus. There was no means testing when  Washington state gave Boeing executives and major shareholders a $9 billion corporate tax handout in 2013. There's no means test for elected officials in Seattle to pay themselves exorbitant six-digit salaries. Means testing is not needed in this legislation because people in eviction court are already at the absolute end of their resources. If they had any money for attorneys, they would have paid their rent in the first place and not got eviction notices.  Means testing is not legally necessary. Means testing can do real harm by creating obstacles for people in desperate need for help. And it opens the door to further weakening of the legislation in the future. And we have the opportunity to set a strong precedent against this today.

I want to first of all thank Council Member Hurwold and President Gonzalez for their comments. You've been hearing me say some of this since  March 4th, so this ordinance as originally written without eligibility criteria is arguably a gift of public funds and therefore violates state law. So in order to remedy this legal flaw and this vulnerability, because we already know that preventing homelessness is a fundamental governmental purpose which we all agree on, today we have eligibility criteria.  where someone can self-attest that they are, in fact, indigenous. So what we do is we looked at other programs where we have a right to counsel in the civil arena, not the criminal arena. And we looked at the Northwest Justice Project and the Tenant Law Center. And Council President, as she shared, proposed, which we all voted on in 2016, the Immigrant Legal Defense Fund, which was passed, the simple,  Eligibility requirement. I'm kind of tired of going back and forth about means testing and eligibility, but I will state this just for the record. Everything Council Member Sawant said about means testing is true, but that's not what we have in front of us. Means testing is a requirement that applicants for any type of government public assistance submit to an investigation of their funds and resources, that they actually have to provide documentation to show that they're indigent.  The means test originated as a method of limiting payment of public assistance to those truly in need in order to reduce the cost of such programs to taxpayers. Means testing was used to limit payment of public assistance to those truly in need. More often than not, it is weaponized. As a former public defender and as a former person at Evergreen Legal Services that represented people in court for unlawful detainer, that is what we looked at. We did not have means testing. We made sure that you had legal counsel.  for unlawful detainer and for the issues that were in front of us today. The eligibility criteria, thank you, Council President, which she brought forward, talks about or actually is very succinct, and it addresses the issue of what anyone may qualify for by simply saying that they're indigent. They choose that they want to participate, and by choosing that they want to participate, they show that they're in fact an indigent person.  I keep saying that, poor. So the eligibility criteria allows and permits governments to provide a benefit that promotes the public good and determines that such criteria, such as indigency, is why we would move forward to make sure.  make another point that I agree with Councilmember Hobo had raised. My main concern about allowing everybody, anybody, like the Oprah show, to have a lawyer all the time, every time, is that then those truly in need that don't have money, that are truly indigent, are not going to get legal counsel because there's only so much money in the last three years we have put in the budget and we have all passed, which Councilmember Sawant has always voted no on. I'd say almost to the tune of a million dollars in the last three years  please correct me if I'm wrong, for people to have legal counsel during eviction when we have put forward money in the budget to ensure that there's money there for people who are being wrongfully evicted have legal counsel. So what I'm trying to say is that we are moving forward on an important piece of legislation that is going to be permanent and which people must just say that they are indeed in need of legal assistance  And they can choose to participate in the program. You know, it's just kind of disheartening that sometimes when you just try to do good things, I don't think I'm in the back pocket of slumlords or big corporations. I still don't know what a progressive Democrat is to some degree. I'm not against the homelessness. I'm certainly not against the poor as a former public defender as well. And as attorney for 35 years, I can say this is pretty straightforward and we're just trying to do a good thing. So thank you.

I first want to thank Council Member Sawant for bringing this forward. This is the first time I've had a chance to sort of talk about this legislation. I was looking forward to voting on it a few weeks ago, and I'm glad that this is moving forward today. So thank you for bringing this forward. I know cities across the country are also looking to do similar things, so I appreciate  the work that's gone into this legislation. I think the outrage that has been expressed about means testing is absolutely right. I think the ire that we all feel that I've expressed before when we talked about this legislation about means testing and income testing is 100% accurate. And I have spent a long time fighting against means testing in the state legislature, especially when I work to implement Apple Health, especially Apple Health for Kids about a dozen years ago.  At that point, means testing, as Council Member Juarez just said, was being weaponized to try to prevent immigrant kiddos from being added to the roles for eligibility for Apple Health at the time. And that is why I have and continue to fight against means testing.  I think that it's important to me to have understood the discussion today and the briefing from the Council President on this amendment in the context of the Immigrant Legal Defense Fund ordinance that it was based off of. As I understand this amendment in front of us, the legal organization will accept self-attestation, simply saying, an individual can simply say,  They don't have the means to afford an attorney. I know a lot of folks who are struggling right now, working month to month, many people out of work or still trying to pay their own rent and childcare and the concept of having to pay an attorney on top of that, a lot of people are going to say that they can't afford an attorney.  So basically, someone's self-attesting that they can't afford an attorney meets the criteria here. That the organization, the legal assistance organization, is not going to ask for income verification, not going to look at any monetary resources, and as I think Councilmember Herbold said, not comply with a test of any kind.  I think that this is a big distinction from the types of means testing that I have fought in the past. Self-attestation is what we've actually fought for in many cases as an alternative to means testing so that people can get the services that they're eligible for and, in this case, that we've determined a right to. I appreciate that there is clarification that there's no documentation required at the time of application or later.  And as I checked in with a handful of legal assistance folks across the city who are currently helping and have previously helped, they noted that this is really important because it's been a longstanding approved process by including federal entities like the Legal Services Corporation to avoid undermining attorney-client privilege and that relationship.  to make sure that they just accept from the client at the point of service that they are not able to pay for an attorney, that any additional type of barrier would be a barrier to the intake and could not be a functional process. So they are very much opposed to means testing.  but have been working under this existing model of self-attestation and believe that this is not an additional barrier. I understand that the standard is not a test now or an application later, and that's a very important clarification that I wanted to put out there because just like I think means testing can have a chilling effect on  whether or not someone applies for services. I also don't want there to be any confusion out there when this bill passes. I'm going to knock on wood. When this bill passes, I don't want there to be any confusion out there about folks coming and signing up. There is no test. At the very least, it sounds like there's going to be a piece of paper that's signed, and we want to make sure folks get access to those services. And I don't want there to be a chilling effect from any debate. We can debate, but ultimately this legislation is going to pass, and  I look forward to supporting the final legislation and will be supporting this amendment today.", "start": 6784, "end": 7024, "Transition": "\"\"", "Meeting Section": "Other", "Speaker Role": "Other", "is_public_comment": 0, "is_public_hearing": 0, "is_comment_start_trigger": 0, "is_comment_end_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_start_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_end_trigger": 0}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_20", "text": "Thank you, Council Member Mosqueda.

I do want to add that another distinction between the self-attestation and means testing is that this will not incur procedural costs since we are not doing financial screenings and investigations into people's financial background to do a self-attestation, which I think is a critical thing to note that means testing and one of the big arguments in addition to  What we've already discussed here today on the impact it can have on people seeking services, the deterrence effect it can have on people seeking services. It also would have incurred real cost to the city in buying the software for half a million dollars, hiring an FTE at a cost of over $100,000. A model of self-attestation does not do that and also can kick in  procedurally at the point when people will need this legal assistance and will not require a delay or a rescheduling of these tenant-related eviction proceedings. So it doesn't come with those logistical and financial costs that means testing would have come with, in addition to all the other horrible things about means testing that we have already discussed extensively in this session.  I do also just want to acknowledge my appreciation for Council President Gonzalez in bringing forward a proposal that is structured to provide the very minimum of potential hurdle while addressing the very real substantive impacts  I don't want to violate the fight club rules of executive session, but I will just say all of us were in that executive session. I think that it is important that we center the guidance and advice of the team that successfully defeated vigorous legal actions against just cause eviction, against first in time protections,  against the various eviction moratoriums this council has enacted. And I believe that it was, I appreciate Council President's diligence in working with that team, working with us on the council to craft something that will still provide this vital service to everyone who will need it, while at the same time strengthening this law against the challenges that we know will come from deep-pocketed and very well-resourced landlord interests that will sue to try to get rid of it.  So with that, Madam President, I don't have any additional comments and appreciate your leadership in bringing this forward as well as the comments of my colleagues similarly speaking to this.", "start": 7032, "end": 7230, "Transition": "\"\"", "Meeting Section": "Other", "Speaker Role": "Other", "is_public_comment": 0, "is_public_hearing": 0, "is_comment_start_trigger": 0, "is_comment_end_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_start_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_end_trigger": 0}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_20", "text": "Thank you, Council Member Lewis.

I just wanted to specifically address the question of self-attestation. I do not agree that self-attestation will not be a barrier because that's not what the data indicates at all. For example, according to Seattle City Light, the official enrollment number for the utility discount program, which is for low-income people who cannot afford to pay their full utility bills, as of the enrollment numbers as of the end of February is 42,094.  and they are currently estimating, the department is currently estimating the number of eligible households is at 90,000. So that means that Seattle's utility discount program has enrolled less than 50% of the estimated eligible households. It used to be even worse than that. It used to be under 20% when I first took office and became the chair of the energy committee and we fought to improve it. And the city now auto-enrolls people who live in Seattle Housing Authority  and other low-income housing. This was part of our effort from our movement to make it an opt-out and rather an opt-in program, but that was not enough. So now the application process has been made simpler, which of course I support making any obstacle simpler, but now there's a simple self-certification so that people can self-certify their income, but still the enrollment remains at less than 50% years later.  And there are many other examples, but I chose this one because it is close to ours. You know, it's right here in the city of Seattle. And so when the evidence does not show that self-attestation will not be a barrier, I don't know how council members can claim that it won't be a barrier because it will.

Are there any additional comments or questions on amendment three?  Otherwise, because I'm the sponsor, I get the last word on it. So just last call on Amendment 3. Okay, I'm going to make some closing remarks here. I do want to thank you all for the conversation and the debate around Amendment 3 and your consideration.  of adopting Amendment 3. There's a few things I want to clarify in response to some of Councilmember Sawant's comments on Amendment 3 that I do think are not entirely accurate. One, I do not believe that lawyers representing tenants are going to humiliate tenants as a result of the passage of Amendment 3. There were some comments made that  Somehow a self attestation was going to result in humiliation. But let's remember that the people who are asking the questions about eligibility and about accessing legal services are the very the very people we're relying to represent those individuals. And I believe that they are going to put forward consistent with their current processes, something that is compassionate, that is not embarrassing.  and that will fulfill their mission of making sure that as many tenants as possible have access to free legal services when needed during eviction proceedings. Second, there has been a creation of comparisons between access to water, light, and roadways to legal aid services that pay for a lawyer, and I believe this is a false equivalency and should be rejected for that reason. Third, this is not a means test.  We have a constitutional obligation to not engage in the gift of public funds. This applies to every single action and determination and decision we make as a city council. That obligation flows, again, from the Washington state constitution. I believe that Amendment 3 focuses our limited resources on those who most need access to free legal services and eviction proceedings, and I believe that even with the inclusion of Amendment 3, those individuals who need  representation for free in eviction proceedings will, in fact, be able to receive those services. Fourth, there's been a lot of remarks by Councilmember Sawant about this setting a precedent that would not otherwise be set if we pass the base bill without Amendment 3. However, only an amendment to the Washington State's Constitution would allow for the state legislature  to avoid the realities of the duties related to the gift of public funds. In other words, this obligation related to avoiding the gift of public funds applies equally to the Washington State Legislature as it does to us. There is no such effort at the state to amend the Constitution to allow for a different standard related to how we allocate and appropriate taxpayer dollars at the local, regional, or state effort.  That is exactly why Senate Bill 5160, which is specifically designed to address the eviction cliff that we are all facing, includes an indigency requirement to create a statewide right to counsel. And lastly, fifth, there's been an analogy created between the indigency standard that we're about to consider adopting in Amendment 3 to the provisions provided for in the utility discount programs.  A simple Google of utility discount program Seattle request enrollment brings up the enrollment form that an individual would have to fill out in order to determine whether or not they're eligible. Unlike the UDP program, my amendment does not, for example, include the disclosure of what is the expected or estimated monthly income for your household before taxes.  In fact, if you look at the UDP eligibility enrollment form, there is a question that requires disclosure of the expected or estimated monthly income for your household before taxes. That requirement is not included in Amendment 3. Only a self-attestation that you cannot afford an attorney will be asked in order to determine legal eligibility under this particular program. So again, I think that there is not a,  a clean comparison between the UDP. The UDP certainly requires much more than a self-certification and attestation of not being able to afford, for example, in that case, paying your bill. So I will close out debate there and appreciate, again, your all's consideration of adopting Amendment 3 and am  excited about voting on this bill to finally, once and for all, create a right to counsel for tenants in the city of Seattle and look forward to doing that very soon here. So without further ado, will the clerk please call the roll on the adoption of Amendment 3?", "start": 7343, "end": 7666, "Transition": "\"\"", "Meeting Section": "Other", "Speaker Role": "Other", "is_public_comment": 0, "is_public_hearing": 0, "is_comment_start_trigger": 0, "is_comment_end_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_start_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_end_trigger": 0}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_18", "text": "Mosqueda?

I will be voting no on this amendment. As was explained, it is just an amendment to a whereas clause, so it does not change the substance of the legislation. However, I am voting no because it is overly prescriptive of how the Department, the Department of Construction Inspections, contracts out these services and does not reflect the reality of eviction court in Seattle.  In the bill that my office has proposed, the base bill, it says that the Seattle Department of Construction Inspection, or SDCI, which is the city department responsible for enforcing renters' rights, is responsible for contracting with an organization to defend renters facing eviction.  Our bill then gives parameters for what makes an organization a good choice to provide these services. We want attorneys with experience defending renters in court against eviction. We want an organization that works out of the King County Courthouse so that renters in eviction court can be met by an attorney when they show up.  The reality is the Housing Justice Project is the only organization like that right now in Seattle. And as they will themselves tell you, there aren't many private firms or any at all, perhaps,  and very few around the country that provide this kind of service, which is defending renters against eviction. The Housing Justice Project attorneys are dedicated and they do their best they can to support renters. That is why the whereas clause we propose states that SDCI should continue contracting with SJP unless another organization becomes better qualified. The legislation currently includes that language, unless another organization becomes better qualified.  We recognize that we do not know who will be defending renters in 10 years, 20 years, maybe it will be a SGP, maybe it will be some organization that doesn't exist right now. The department is empowered by the legislation to make that decision. We do not require that the department contract the SGP, but we do acknowledge the role that they are playing right now.  whether sdci uses an rfp or an rq rfq or renews existing contracts none of this needs to be prescribed in the legislation i do want to stress again that because this amendment changes only a whereas clause it does not change any functional part of the legislation however i do think it's unnecessary and overly prescriptive so i'll leave it you know thank you councilmember herbals", "start": 7868, "end": 8010, "Transition": "\"\"", "Meeting Section": "Other", "Speaker Role": "Other", "is_public_comment": 0, "is_public_hearing": 0, "is_comment_start_trigger": 0, "is_comment_end_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_start_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_end_trigger": 0}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_17", "text": "Thank you.

Any tenant should know that they have support during one of the hardest times in their life, and that support shouldn't be contingent on a public health emergency or any other limitations.

And as eviction moratorium are lifted across the region and the public emergency is in our rearview mirror, we know that many of our neighbors will be in tough situations again.  At the moment, those lucky enough to know about programs like the Housing Justice Project or the Tenant Law Center know that legal representation can be the difference between remaining housed and creating a plan to have to live in your car. And folks shouldn't have to feel lucky to access limited free legal representation.

I think that there's a tremendous amount to celebrate as Seattle, again, is going to be looked at as a national leader in this issue. I was trying to look up the statistic just to remind myself. But on this morning's news, I believe it was on Democracy Now!, I heard that around 20 percent of renters are still struggling to be able to pay rent. And the cliff for when those eviction moratoriums go away is very real and threatening.  We are working very hard to make sure that renters have dollars in hand. And I want to reiterate rental assistance bill that we're considering next week is also a small landlord assistance bill, right? Because it passes through and it's part of that support network that goes to our smallest landlords who are also being impacted by the consequences of COVID. So I see it as a both and conversation. Today's bill is truly something to be celebrated.  And for us to continue to reiterate to people that if you are facing eviction, you now have a right to counsel. And we can say that with incredible pride in the city of Seattle. Thank you all for all of your amendments that you brought forward today to make this legislation stronger. And thanks to Council Member Sawant and Morales and Aglique Lewis, who are the original co-sponsors as well of this legislation. I am looking forward to passing it and to showing that  unanimity across council for our united support. And to do that, not just for renters who are facing eviction, but truly to provide a more stable local economy as we recover.

And some of the findings include the fact that nearly 52% of tenants in eviction filings were people of color,  Thirty one point two percent were black tenants. And this is an eviction rate of four point five times what would be expected based on their demographics in Seattle. Women were more likely to be evicted over small amounts of money of single tenant households where a tenant owed one hundred dollars or less. Eighty one percent of those being evicted were women.  Tenants face steep financial costs resulting from an eviction. The median court judgment was over $3,000, including rent owed, non-rent charges, and legal costs. And nearly 86% of eviction filings were for non-payment of rent. And of these, 52% were for one month or less in rent.  Tenants were required to pay attorney's fees, 91% of cases with a median charge of about $416, and court costs, 92% of cases with a median charge of about $360.  So those stats are really focused, I think, on not just the basis for why we made changes to the eviction law, both in state law and in our own local law,  In eviction cases that are related to nonpayment of rent, now tenants have more of a right to make an argument about the conditions that lead to nonpayment of rent cases. But in order to make these arguments, to address these really heartbreaking findings from the losing home report, tenants need to have...  Eviction prevention legal advice from trained attorneys in order to make the arguments for the application of the new rights that they have since 2019's changes in the state legislature and in city law as well.  So, again, just really wanting to bring it back to the inequities that we see in our eviction court system. And, you know, we can't just always work on improving the laws and the rights, but we have to also address people's ability to stand up for them.

I'll just make a couple of additional remarks to build on what my colleagues have already said. And for me, a big thing that was instructive early on to sign on as a co-sponsor to this critical legislation  was the statistic out of New York, which has a robust right to counsel law and has for some time, that 86% of the people who were represented in an eviction proceeding avoided an eviction.  which suggests to me in the way that our eviction system is set up and the law around evictions and the courts and how these hearings are conducted and the traditional expectation of who does and does not have representation in those proceedings has led to thousands, hundreds of thousands nationally of illegal evictions.  that when you have counsel in the courtroom and an advocate that can stand with you to address the merits of the case that your landlord is bringing, tenants overwhelmingly have been able to stand up, and hopefully this will have a deterrent effect as that countervailing power in the courtroom for tenants becomes well known, that unmeritorious evictions will no longer be tolerated in Seattle and King County.  And this legislation could end up having a really profound impact and certainly has in other parts of the country. And I really look forward to the impact that we're going to see in our neighbors who are tenants being able to live with a sense of security in reducing the number of our neighbors who fall into a state of homelessness and end up living in encampments and in vehicles.  I really look forward to the next phase here in making sure we have sufficient appropriation to sustain and build on this right going forward in a city that is majority renter and make sure that this right is vigorously well enforced.

I'm very happy from the comments that council members have made that this bill is likely to pass unanimously. With this legislation, Seattle is about to become the first city in Washington state that guarantees the right to counsel for renters facing eviction. This victory belongs to the renters' right and socialist movement, which my council office is proud to be a part of, and which understands that it takes a fighting strategy  to overcome corporate landlords and politicians. Seattle now joined New York, San Francisco, Boulder, Colorado, Newark, New Jersey, Baltimore, Maryland, among others, in prescribing legal rights for renters facing eviction.  Hundreds of community members and many community organizations deserve credit for this victory, particularly BC Seattle, Tenants Union of Washington State, UAW 4121, Socialist Alternative, the Book Workers Union, the Housing Justice Project, the American Civil Liberties Union, both the Washington State Affiliate and the National ACLU, Real Change, Transit Riders Union, Faith Action Network, and many others.  including the dozens of activists specifically socialist alternative members virtually all of whom are struggling workers and renters who collected 468 signatures from working people in our city who strongly support this legislation for the last seven years our council office has served as a center of organizing for the renters rights movement we've built powerful movements fought for and won breakthrough renters rights legislation  like the law that bans rent increases in buildings where code violations exist, the ban on winter evictions, a cap on move-in fees. We did all of this through collaboration and unity. Collaboration and unity among ordinary people, workers, rank and file members, community organizations, and individual community members  who have no power or influence by themselves, but become strong when we organize together and fight back. We have won unanimous votes repeatedly by fighting back as a movement. We celebrate this victory, but we also cannot become complacent because we know that the status quo is still  heavily stacked against renters and in favor of corporate landlords. Landlords have immense power and in many cases power over whether people can afford to remain housed.  That is why we still need a huge expansion of social housing by public revenues that tax big business. So we need to increase the Amazon tax. We need to make sure that renters rights themselves are continue to be strengthened. That's why my office and the growing renters rights movement will not rest after today's passage of right to counsel.  Our movement will claim today's win as a win for the grassroots movement and will go forward to advance legislation to protect renters from default evictions. Half of all evictions in Seattle happen by default, meaning the court automatically evicts the renter because they did not fill out the paperwork to request a hearing or did not attend the hearing. And often it is the most vulnerable renters who are evicted by default, the renters most in need of legal support.  We have heard horror stories of people who are bedridden, who are in a coma or who have dementia being evicted by default without even knowing it is happening.  My office is already also working on a moratorium on evictions of school children and their families during the months of the school year, as was suggested, importantly, by a school board member. We have also been working on legislation requiring landlords to have to meet a just cost standard for all evictions by closing the current loophole that allows landlords to evict term lease tenants without cause.  We're also preparing to develop legislation creating standardized terms for renter leases. The reality is the average renter in Seattle has no opportunity to negotiate or alter even the smallest part of their lease when they move into a house or apartment. As a result, many leases have outrageous terms. So we do need to continue to strengthen renters' rights, to have a full bill of renters' rights, and even that will not be enough. We will need to fight for rent control.  We will need to fight to cancel rent and mortgage and utility debt for those who are struggling because of income or job losses because of the pandemic and the recession.

And through a combination of actions, we can continue to prevent an increase in bills this year. In addition, Seattle City Light will be keeping their promise for next year, 2022, by sticking with the original rate path agreed to back in 2018 and possibly achieving a smaller increase if pass-through rates from Bonneville Power Administration come in lower.

The minutes of the City Council meetings of April 26, 2021 have been reviewed. If there's no objection, the minutes will be signed. Hearing no objection, the minutes are being signed. Will the clerk please affix my signature to the minutes?  If there is no objection, the introduction and referral calendar will be adopted. Hearing no objection, the introduction and referral calendar is adopted. If there is no objection, the agenda will be adopted. Hearing no objection, the agenda is adopted.  Colleagues, at this time, we will open the remote public comment period for items on the City Council agenda, introduction and referral calendar, and the Council's work program. I want to thank everyone for their ongoing patience and cooperation as we continue to operate this remote public comment system. It remains the strong intent of the City Council to have remote public comment regularly included on meeting agendas. However, as a reminder, the City Council reserves the right to end or eliminate these public comment periods  At any point, if we deem that the system is being abused or is no longer suitable for allowing our meetings to be conducted efficiently and effectively. I will moderate the public comment period in the following manner. Today's public comment period is 20 minutes and each speaker will have two minutes to speak. Speakers are called upon in the order in which they registered to provide public comment on the council's website.  Each speaker must call in from the phone number used for this registration and using the meeting phone number ID and passcode that was emailed to them upon confirmation. This is different than the general meeting listen line call in information. So as you are listening to me give the parameters of public comment, double check that you are calling into the right number. Again, I will call on each speaker by name and in the order in which they registered on the council's website,  If you've not yet registered to speak, but would like to, you can still sign up before the end of today's public comment. You can do that by going to the council's website at seattle.gov forward slash council. The public comment link is also listed on today's published agenda. Once I call your name, staff will unmute your microphone and you will hear the automatic prompt of you have been unmuted. That'll be your cue that it is your turn to speak. But before you begin to speak, you must press star  in order to unmute yourself. I'd ask that you start by telling us your name, the item that you are addressing, and again, as a reminder, public comment should relate to an item on today's agenda, the introduction and referral calendar, or the Council's work program. Speakers will hear a chime when you have 10 seconds left of your two minutes. Once you hear the chime, please begin to wrap up your public comment. If you don't wrap up your comments at the end of the two minutes,  then your microphone will be muted to allow me to call on the next speaker. Once you've completed your public comment, we ask that you please disconnect from the line. And if you plan to continue following this meeting, you can do so via Seattle channel or the listening options listed on the agenda. Public comment period is now open. And we're gonna begin with the first speaker on the list. Again, once I call your name and you hear the automatic prompt, don't forget to press star  six after you hear the prompt, you have been unmuted. So first up is Howard Gale. Next after Howard is Marissa Parshatam.", "start": 53, "end": 259, "Transition": "Comments - Into", "Meeting Section": "Public Comment", "Speaker Role": "Government", "is_public_comment": 0, "is_public_hearing": 0, "is_comment_start_trigger": 1, "is_comment_end_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_start_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_end_trigger": 0}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_08", "text": "Howard, welcome. Good afternoon. Howard Gale, District 7, commenting on continuing police abuse and failed police accountability. We are weeks away from the one year anniversary of George Floyd, nearly a year after the police  in Seattle unleashed violence, false arrest, and gross violations of people's First Amendment rights upon the very people who pay them to protect and serve. What has resulted from the many thousands of complaints about police abuse and violence? This is a question that the Public Safety Committee and the Council as a whole has simply ignored or forgotten. As of last Friday, the Office of Police Accountability has found a total of only 17 complaints  out of many thousands to be partially or totally sustained. Of those 17 complaints, 12 officers received reprimands. One officer received a two-day suspension and four are still pending discipline. This, along with the OPA's repeated approval of SVD murders, is far more than sufficient evidence that our accountability system is not working. The council's unquestioned belief that our accountability system works has only produced more police abuse  less accountability and promises even more abuse in the months ahead. We need full civilian control of police oversight moving beyond Seattle's existing system of police investigating police. We have full civilian control in places like Nashville, Oakland, Portland, Oregon, and other cities. If the council remains unmovable on this fundamental issue of justice,  The people of Seattle will take control of this issue back from the council.

A pathway to citizenship is so important and far overdue because immigrants have been facing various struggles for many years now. So what would a pathway to citizenship mean to me, my family, and my community? A pathway to citizenship for my parents would put me at ease. I would lose the fear of my parents ever being deported, leaving my siblings and I behind. It would mean them getting better opportunities and having a bigger range of jobs available to them.  And something that I hold close to my heart is that they would be able to travel outside of the country with me and come back with ease. I remember the first time I was away from home. It was fifth grade. I went on a school trip for five days. Once I came home, I hugged my parents so tight because I missed them. The longest I've been away from home is only two weeks. While my dad has been apart from his mom for 17 years, I can't imagine being away from my parents for that long.  The closest thing my dad has to being with her is a video call through the phone, and he misses her a lot. Every holiday, every birthday, every Mother's Day, he thinks of her. A pathway to citizenship would provide not only my dad, but so many immigrants who have families in their home countries that she has to reunite.

While I do not refer to myself exclusively as American, the U.S. has been my home since 2005.

Now that I am in college, I am looking into what I would like to do in the future. This relief is no longer there. And again, I am filled with worry. Will my status always be in limbo?  My vision is that Congress work together to provide a pathway to citizenship for all undocumented individuals in this country. We have heard enough promises. We want actions.

Immigrant communities and communities of color made immigration reform possible because we rose up in the 2020 elections and built our movements for decades before that. We helped put Joe Biden and Kamala Harris in the White House.  We took control of the Senate, and we made impacts on local and municipal level elections as well. Yet we see our elected officials, particularly in the White House and in Congress, hesitate. We've been told that we must wait, that our government will do the right thing. Our communities continue to be excluded, demeaned, and still to this day continue to live in fear. We see our leaders rise to the challenge every time, and it is time for  elected officials like all of you here today to do the same. The time is now, and I'm glad to see the Seattle City Council acknowledging and acting on the urgency of this moment, which will be a model for cities to demand immediate action by Congress to pass a pathway to citizenship for the many undocumented people in this country.

Despu\u00e9s de servir a la comunidad de trabajadores de campo por 12 a\u00f1os y de conocer bien las necesidades de todos ellos, me animo a venir con ustedes ahora para decir que es realmente importante ofrecer una reforma migratoria  Que les d\u00e9 dignidad y respeto a mis compa\u00f1eros inmigrantes indocumentados porque se lo merecen. Las personas que trabajan en el campo son olvidadas porque no est\u00e1n presentes en estas reuniones exigiendo ellos mismos lo que se merecen. Los trabajadores hacen que esta naci\u00f3n sea pr\u00f3spera. Trabajan muchas horas sin importar las inclemencias del tiempo. Tenemos comida por su gran esfuerzo y no es justo que vivan con miedo por su estatus.  Cada vez que votamos lo hacemos con la esperanza de que por fin haya una reforma migratoria. Lamentablemente, todav\u00eda no ha llegado ese d\u00eda. Hoy es el d\u00eda, es el momento preciso para hacerlo. Se tiene que ofrecer una situaci\u00f3n legal para que los trabajadores puedan vivir con respeto y dignidad. Por esto estoy aqu\u00ed para pedirles su apoyo en esta resoluci\u00f3n para que act\u00faen a favor de la resoluci\u00f3n", "start": 947, "end": 1051, "Transition": "\"\"", "Meeting Section": "Public Comment", "Speaker Role": "Commenter", "is_public_comment": 1, "is_public_hearing": 0, "is_comment_start_trigger": 0, "is_comment_end_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_start_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_end_trigger": 0}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "text": "Yes, thank you.", "start": 1058, "end": 1063, "Transition": "\"\"", "Meeting Section": "Public Comment", "Speaker Role": "Government", "is_public_comment": 0, "is_public_hearing": 0, "is_comment_start_trigger": 0, "is_comment_end_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_start_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_end_trigger": 0}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_12", "text": "Good afternoon, everyone.

I move to adopt Resolution 32005. Is there a second? Second. Thank you so much.  It's been moved and seconded to adopt Resolution 32005. I am the sponsor of this item, so I will address it and then happy to open the floor for comments. Colleagues, before us today is this really important resolution that I mentioned briefly during our council briefing this morning. My office has worked over the last several weeks with many community leaders, including those at One America, to develop this resolution.  It is in support of community organizing efforts and Representative Pramila Jayapal's Roadmap to Freedom resolution, which seeks to fix our broken immigration system. This resolution calls on Congress to do several things. First, to create a roadmap to citizenship for 11 million undocumented immigrants across the country, including for those residing, working here in Seattle.  to support family reunification by increasing the number of family visas available. We also, through this resolution, call on Congress to improve our standing in the eyes of the world by improving our asylum and refugee systems and grow the number of asylees and refugees we legally admit into our country. The city calls on our federal government to also put an end to private immigration detention, just like our Washington state legislature recently did in this past session.  We must reform these punitive detention and deportation practices, and we ask for a moratorium on deportation. And finally, we ask Congress to not leave out immigrants, especially those that are undocumented, of any pandemic recovery efforts because of their status. It is vital that Congress acts with urgency and uses every tool at their disposal, including budget reconciliation, to finally once and for all achieve comprehensive immigration reform.  As a council member, I have heard so many stories over the last 15 months about how this pandemic has exacerbated and magnified every systemic inequity we have in our society. The barrier that immigration status has caused for so many during this pandemic has been devastating. Thousands of local families were left out of relief and assistance needed to survive this pandemic because of their immigration status.  Many undocumented immigrants cannot access lifelines like unemployment insurance, health care insurance, and other types of benefits that they need in order to continue to survive. Local governments like Seattle have continued to step up as both the first and the last line of defense.  I'm proud of the work our city has done. I'm proud of the work this city council has done to support our immigrant neighbors, including making sure that we were not excluding our undocumented immigrant and refugee neighbors from our very own Jumpstart Seattle payroll tax. But we simply do not have the resources to meet the scale of the need of our community members. We need our federal government to act once and for all and with urgency.  And that must include fixing our broken immigration system and ensuring immigrant communities do not get left behind as we come out of this pandemic. After four years of a federal government that has continually targeted immigrants and refugees, telling us we do not belong, brutalizing our communities and neighborhoods with xenophobia, racism, and family separation, it is time for reckoning and healing, and it is my  deep hope that Congress will finally act and not delay any longer. Passing this resolution is absolutely necessary in order for our representative, Representative Jayapal, to have all of the all of the resources, all of the tools and all of the support of her local jurisdiction and constituents to be able to go to Washington, D.C. and advocate accordingly. So with that colleague, I would encourage and appreciate your yes vote on this resolution.  Are there any additional comments on the resolution?

Next up is approval of the minutes. The minutes of the City Council meeting of May 24th, 2021 have been reviewed. If there is no objection, the minutes will be signed.  Hearing no objection, the minutes are being signed. Will the clerk please affix my signature to the minutes? Approval of the introduction referral calendar. If there's no objection, the introduction referral calendar will be adopted. Hearing no objection, the introduction and referral calendar is now adopted. Approval of the agenda. If there's no objection, the agenda will be adopted. Hearing no objection, the agenda is now adopted.  Okay, colleagues, at this time, we are going to open up the remote public comment period for items on the city council agenda, introduction referral calendar, and the council's work program. I want to thank everyone for their ongoing patience and cooperation as we continue to operate this remote public comment system. It remains our strong intent to have remote public comment regularly included on meeting agendas. However, as a reminder, the city council reserves the right to end or eliminate these public comment periods at any point if we deem that this system is being abused or is no longer suitable for allowing  our meetings to be conducted efficiently and effectively. I'll moderate the public comment period in the following manner. The public comment period for this meeting was scheduled to be 20 minutes with each speaker having two minutes to speak. However, we have 40  two individuals signed up to date for public comment today. I do want to make sure that we have an opportunity to hear from everyone. So I am going to go ahead and extend public comment on the front end this morning to allow us to hear from everyone who has called in so far. So if there is no objection, the public comment period will be extended to 60 minutes.  Hearing no objection, the public comment period is now extended to 60 minutes. If we need to extend it a little further to allow for everyone to address the city council this afternoon, we will make sure to do that accordingly. So speakers are, again, going to be called upon in the order in which they register to provide public comment on the council's website. Each speaker has to call in from the phone number used for this registration and using the meeting phone number, ID, and passcode that was emailed to them upon confirmation.  This is different than the general meeting listen line call-in information. So if you're listening to me right now and you're waiting to give public comment, make sure that you double check the email confirmation that you received from our staff, check that you're calling from the number that you used to register and that you called into the specific number using the ID and passcode that was emailed to you when your registration was confirmed. If you have called into the general meeting listen line,  you will show up as not present on my end on our public comment sign up sheet. If you are showing up as not present, I am going to continue to call your name so that you understand that I'm not skipping you and that we are having difficulty seeing you in the waiting room and therefore are marking you as not present. So again, make sure you double check that information that you received in the emailed confirmation to make sure  that you have called in with the exact number that you registered with and that you have called in to the appropriate number, not the general meeting listen line. Again, I'm gonna call in each speaker by name and in the order in which they registered on the council's website. If you haven't registered to speak yet, but would like to, you can do so by going to seattle.gov forward slash council, that's C-O-U-N-C-I-L, and you can sign up and register to give public comment before I end public comment today.  Once I call on your name, you will be unmuted and you're going to hear an automatic prompt of you have been unmuted. That's gonna be your cue that it is your turn to press star six and then begin speaking. Again, you're gonna hear an automatic prompt. After you hear that prompt, press star six before you begin to speak.  Please begin speaking by stating your name and the item that you are addressing. As a reminder, public comment should relate to an item on today's agenda, the introduction and referral calendar, or the council's work program. Speakers are going to hear a chime around 10 seconds. That chime means that you have 10 seconds left of your allotted two minutes to address the city council today. Once you hear the chime, we are going to ask that you begin to wrap up your public comment. If you do not end your comments at the end of the two minutes,  your speaker, your microphone is going to be muted. So I can call on the next speaker. Once you've completed your public comment, I'd ask that you please disconnect from the line. And if you plan to continue following this meeting, you can do so on the Seattle channel or one of the listening options on the agenda. So the public comment period is now open and we're going to begin with the first speaker on the list. Oops, just give me just a minute.

It took the resurgence of the Black Lives Matter movement and the presence and the unimaginable strength  of family and friends to keep this case in the news. It also took the highly unusual intervention of the governor and attorney general in order to provide for a truly independent investigation. But what about all those people killed by Seattle police whose killings didn't get the prerequisite press coverage and whose families couldn't navigate what is an unresponsive and victimizing accountability system? What about those who didn't have family in the area to advocate for their loved ones and to bring their cases to light?  The families and friends of Charlena Lyles, Iosea Falotogo, Danny Rodriguez, Ryan Smith, Sean Leifer, Terry Kaver, and Derek Hayden had to suffer not just their loved one's murder, but additionally suffer from the fact that they were killed in Seattle where truly independent investigations have been and remain impossible.

All of a sudden, I was surprised that country music started blaring on the speakers and dozens of police officers came out of nowhere using tear gas and stun grenades. Looking back on it, it felt like it was a game to them. Once things died down and people left, I then saw multiple police officers aggressively charge a group of BIPOC individuals from 50 feet away. They were just sitting on the ground trying to collect themselves.  This is just one of the countless incidents I can't even fathom. And to be clear, by not rejecting this bill, you are choosing this violent behavior instead of community. Instead, please listen to what BIPOC community and organizers are saying.

On June 7, 2020, J.H. was peacefully protesting in defense of Black Lives at Levenson Pine when multiple explosives fired by SPD discharged in his immediate vicinity. His bicycle was hit, and so was he, receiving two abrasions to his legs. A separate incident on July 1, 2020,  J.H. was protesting at Broadway and Pine, where a line of riot police was facing off protesters. The officers instructed protesters to stay on the other side of the sidewalk, and J.H. complied. But suddenly, police rushed at the protesters into the portion of the crosswalk where protesters were standing at police instruction. Multiple officers tackled J.H., pinned him to the ground, and punched him. He heard his bicycle helmet crack, and the weight of the officers pinning him made it difficult for him to breathe. The officers finally pulled him to his feet after he exclaimed, I can't breathe.  J.H. was arrested and told that he hit an officer with his bike and resisted arrest. He was booked, held for about 18 hours, and charged with third-degree assault and failure to disperse. Those charges have since been dropped. As a result of the explosive devices and physical force that SBD deployed against him, J.H. suffered from pain, trauma, and multiple injuries, including a fractured rib, bruised and swollen hip, sprained right thumb, and cuts and bruises over his entire body.

I'd like to read a testimony of SPD's violence on July 25, 2020, from a person identified as TVM. TVM and her husband saw a man step into the street while recording the protests. A police officer ran over the man's foot with their bikes, causing him to fall. Her husband tried to help the man to his feet, but was tackled to the ground by the police. As TVM reached for her husband to help him, she was also tackled by an officer.  Multiple officers piled on top of her back, pinning her face down, and at least one officer kneeled on her neck with intense pressure. The officers tore off the motorcycle helmet she wore without loosening the chinstrap, causing her neck to wrench and her face mask to dislodge and cover her face. Officers also cut the straps of her backpack with a knife and took it. She was then handcuffed and transported to the East Precinct, where she was kept in handcuffs for four hours. TVM felt pain in her shoulder, wrists, back, and neck. She was not able to hold her head upright.  Officers asked if she was injured, and she said yes, but they did not evaluate her, send a medical professional to see her, or check her handcuffs. After she was released the next day at the hospital, TVM was diagnosed with a bulging disc between her C5 and C6 vertebrae and with severe swelling in her neck. As a direct and proximate result of the excessive force and chemical weapons used on her by the city and SPD, her unlawful arrest and her unlawful treatment at the King County Jail  TVM suffered pain, trauma, chemical exposure, neck injury, calf injury, loss of mobility in the left arm, bulging disc, neck swelling, PTSD, and more.

I was hyperventilating, then I lost consciousness. I can remember smoke and what seemed like fire. The next morning, I woke up in the hospital with a tube down my throat. A doctor told me that I went into cardiac arrest on the street, and if the volunteer medics had not provided onsite chest compressions, I might have died.

I'm going to read an excerpt now from testimony by a person identified with the initials DT.  writing about the events of June 25, 2020. I arrived to the Seattle Central Lawn in the early afternoon. The crowd was overwhelmingly made up of peaceful protesters. The first explosions I heard were when our march turned a corner and saw a large group of bike police up the hill unleash a round of flashbang grenades onto the street before chasing everyone down the hill.  The police deployed this first round, seemingly to create a lot of noise and scary smoke as they charged down the hill at us. This came out of nowhere. It honestly was terrifying. I've never seen anything like it. Later, police started throwing blast balls and flashbang grenades indiscriminately into the crowd. My impression was that they are increasing the level of violence and intentionally terrorizing people. I had multiple explosives land and explode at my feet.  I got hit in the face with a large piece of a shell from a blast ball that exploded at my feet. I got chemical burns all over my face. I was really scared. I've seen pictures of people who lost eyes that way. There was so much smoke in the air. The rate of deployment and the volume of weapons was much greater than I'd seen at earlier protests.  I can't think of a better way to describe the Seattle Police Department's use of force.

Thanks. I'm Alice Lockhart, speaking in argument against Council Bill 119981. And I'll read a little bit of testimony from EB, a registered nurse.  E.B. attended a protest against police brutality as a nurse, not a demonstrator, and writes, not long after I arrived, I observed police pushing protesters west on Pine. They were deploying batons, pepper spray, and flashbang grenades. E.B. writes of being pepper sprayed directly in the face, not once, but twice, with absolutely no provocation as E.B. attempted to assist protesters injured by police.  EB says, I was not a threat. I was not dangerous. I was not breaking anything or hurting anybody. I am a nurse. EB wrote that SPD used a constant barrage of flashbang grenades and pepper sprays to forcibly corral the crowd further and further out of Capitol Hill. At one point, I witnessed a woman shot at close range in the chest with some kind of gas canister. The force of the impact was incredible. I examined her later, and I suspect the hit broke her wrist. In her conclusion, EB wrote,  I had witnessed non-violent protesters being continuously assaulted with batons, pepper spray, and flash grenades for no other reason than their inability to immediately comply with law enforcement's demands while under assault. I had seen multiple people struck at close range with projectiles that could have easily shattered their bones. I now had four prone, incapacitated, helpless people with me, screaming and vomiting from pain on the ground.  Please don't reward police abuse. Vote no on Council Bill 119981.

I'd like to read a testimony of SPD's violence on June 7, 2020, from a person identified as JK.  Around 12 p.m., JK was in the front of the crowd near the barricade playing her drum. The police attempted to move the protesters back, but JK couldn't move very far, stuck between a mass of protesters on one side and a line of officers on the other. Suddenly, an officer grabbed JK by the neck and yanked her into the police line, knocking JK unconscious. JK does not know how long she was out. When she regained consciousness, she was lying on the ground behind the barricade and missing her protest equipment. After EMTs provided her with some cursory treatment,  The police moved her to a cell. JK was disoriented and on the verge of vomiting from the head injuries she sustained, yet she was not provided with further medical treatment. While in the cell, an officer ripped away from JK a blanket she had been provided by the EMTs. JK was also placed in handcuffs while still being held in the cell. Eventually, she was moved to King County and released later in the day on June 8, 2020. JK was charged with failure to disperse and obstructing a police officer, and these charges were dropped.

I will read a testimony of SPD's violence on September 23, 2020, from a person identified as AF. Quote, on Wednesday, September 23, the night after prosecutors in Louisville decided not to charge Breonna Taylor's killers with murder,  I protested in Capitol Hill. That night, the Seattle Police Department hit me in the head with a flashbang, choked me with pepper spray and gas until I could not see or breathe, chased me until I had a panic attack and thought I would vomit and pass out, and badly injured many people around me. I've been to many, many protests since the killing of George Floyd, including several with heavy police violence, like the protests in early June and on July 25th, but SPD's response on September 23rd felt especially brutal. There were about 400 of us out protesting at the beginning. For a while, SPD followed behind us in their police vehicles, their lights flashing.  At some point, SPD started aggressively pushing us back, as they always do. I was fairly close to the police, trying to move back, but with a huge crowd ahead of me. We yelled, move, move, at the protesters in front of us, trying to get them to make space so we could move. But at one point, the crowd was just so backed up that we couldn't move at all, which was really scary. SPD started throwing an inordinate number of flashbangs at us when we got to Broadway. They threw so many at us that a woman on the sidewalk, who was just walking by, started yelling at the police to stop it and stop terrorizing the neighborhood. Next thing I knew, she was on the ground, being dogpiled by a bunch of SPD officers.  A couple people built a barricade and lit it on fire. Other than this, the only time I saw a protester damage property that night was when someone spray-painted a vehicle and immediately got arrested. The vast, vast majority of the crowd was not doing anything destructive or dangerous. Some people went towards the East Precinct a block away. I heard an explosion of some kind happen at the East Precinct, and all of a sudden, protesters came running back down towards us, followed by bike cops. The bike cops moved around the fire onto the sidewalk and started pushing us back, type-perspiring the entire front line of protesters.  They must have directly pepper sprayed 20 people who hadn't done anything other than put their bodies on the front line. Please reject Bill 119981. Thank you.

I'm going to read now from some testimony given in response to SPD's actions in 2020 from a person identified as S.S.  SS says at a September protest, SPD pushed us back with bikes and pepper spray into a parking lot. When we were able to get back into the street, they continued to chase us. Lines of bike cops would ride in, skim their bikes as close to the protest as they could, shoving us forward. I was trying to walk away from the police line, but unable to walk fast enough to satisfy SPD.  As they pushed us, SPD threw more explosives that were loud like concussion grenades. I don't know from where SPD was throwing the flashbangs, but that night they hit with such force that they ricocheted off the ground high enough to reach my head, and I am 6'3\". The flashbangs were very disorienting, especially combined with SPD bike officers hitting people with their bikes immediately afterwards. SPD's mood seemed jubilant. I saw officers smiling as they threatened us with force and forced us to march.  It seemed like this was a game to them. SPD bike officers rode at us. One officer was shoving his handlebars into people's faces. There was no justification for this. We were moving back as fast as we could. Early on in the march, SPD started following us very close. They quickly started grabbing protesters. They grabbed protesters as we were rounding a corner and then again as we were going up a hill. It seemed like they were grabbing anyone they could pick off from the crowd. SPD pepper sprayed us two to three times from close range.  One of the people I was with ducked his head down as an officer unleashed a torrent of pepper spray into his face from about one foot away. The force from the pepper spray moved his goggles out of place, and the goggles began filling full of pepper spray.

He began filming as protesters ran from the police. SPD officers began forming in a line across 12th Avenue, pushing protesters south. He was retreating backwards when he heard some commotion behind him. Suddenly, an officer shoved EL and knocked him backwards to the ground, knocking his phone out of his hand. As he reached for his phone, still on his hands and knees, another officer grabbed it from his hand.  An officer then smashed his face to the pavement while others kneeled on his back, legs, and arms. They then handcuffed him, cut his backpack off him, and transported him to the West Precinct. At the West Precinct, EL was denied water for about three hours. An officer yelled in his face when he asked why he was being held. He was eventually transported to King County Jail. Upon arrival at KCJ, the officers escorted EL inside slammed his body into the door between the jail and the garage.  A jail guard slammed his head into the surface of a desk, breaking his two front teeth as depicted in a picture online. I urge you today, please don't award SPD violence.

I'd like to read a testimony of SPD's violence on July 25, 2020, from a person identified as JM. On July 25, JM was out on the street with Converge documenting the protest.  JM was standing off to the side of the street with a group of members of the media and had the press badge clearly displayed. The police began deliberately attacking the group by throwing blast balls right at them, even though the group only contained members of the media. The police repeatedly lobbed explosive devices far into the crowd that seemed to explode at shoulder or head level. One blast ball exploded very close to JM and a piece of shrapnel hit them in their neck and arm. Even though they were wearing a neck covering, JM felt extreme pain and they had to be helped to the group  because they could barely stand. JM still can't hear correctly out of their right ear due to the explosion. Within two minutes after being hit, JM and their colleagues began quickly moving away from the area and away from the advancing officers. There was a large crowd in their past as they retreated, so they could only move as fast as the people in front of them. JM held their press badge over their right shoulder to make sure the police could still identify them as press. As they were walking away, the police started quickly advancing and pulled out OC spray.  J.M. did not hear a dispersal order or any warning, and the police began indiscriminately spraying blue dye O.C. spray into the group. J.M. was sprayed with blue dye O.C. spray on their face and arm.

I attended the Labor Day protest outside of Spog. SPD officers launched blast balls at me, maced me in the face and forced me to march quickly while I screamed in pain, unable to seek treatment for my injuries. The police weapons and forced fast march triggered an asthma attack, causing me to pass out on the side of the road.  Ken, people tried to flee the gas, but the police had positioned themselves in a few different places to cut off access to anywhere we could possibly go to escape. Police threw glass balls indiscriminately into the middle of the densely packed crowd. Two of them exploded near my feet, hitting my feet and leaving burn marks on my sneakers. Police pulled the part of the crowd where I was in into a parking lot across the street from Spock. I thought SPD might allow us to disperse, but they did not. Instead, they funneled protesters into a thin line, seemingly indiscriminately blasting Mesa, everyone who fell out of this line.  I had a brown and white umbrella open for protection from police weapons, and police blasted it with pepper spray so much that it turned orange. I walked screaming in pain because of the mace in my eyes, crying for help. A stranger held onto my backpack to push me forward so I wouldn't be in danger of falling behind.

Not back into a department that uses resources to harm community members. On the topic of gun violence, the tragic shooting incident at Ogle Park yesterday in Ravenna is now being used as a pretext to sweep everyone in that camp by Thursday morning. And that is so wrong. When there's a  a shooting or a crime with someone who lives in a housing neighborhood, don't demolish the houses over on the block. At the very least, people in that encampment should have priority for ongoing housing becomes available. But now I'm going to read a testimony of SPD's violence on May 30th from a person identified as AE2.  I have challenged a protest every day since the killing of George Floyd in Seattle and Tacoma. I protested in Tacoma during the weekend in Seattle on weekends, often using a new school year to assist with my spinal disability. While protesting during the weekends of May 30th and June 12th, I saw the Seattle Police Department use chemical agents including tear gas, mace, and possibly pepper spray, as well as flash grenades against protesters, even a child, who were not doing anything other than refusing to go home. On Saturday, I was on the front lines of the protest in Westlake when an SPV began using multiple weapons indiscriminately against protestors.  This is all my first exposure to tear gas. In the Navy during boot camp, recruits were exposed to tear gas while we were wearing gas masks and told to puncture the seal so we could feel what tear gas feels like. On May 30th, SPD's gas dispersed through the crowd well beyond the immediate vicinity where it was deployed, making my eyes sting and triggering my trauma, causing me to have an attack. SPD also deployed flashbang grenades. I also saw an SPD officer mace a little girl who posed no risk to the officer. On June 6th,  SPD kept repeating that they wanted producers to move back, but the crowd.", "start": 3345, "end": 3472, "Transition": "\"\"", "Meeting Section": "Public Comment", "Speaker Role": "Commenter", "is_public_comment": 1, "is_public_hearing": 0, "is_comment_start_trigger": 0, "is_comment_end_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_start_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_end_trigger": 0}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_21", "text": "Hi, Aiden.

Those funds must go to community-led participatory budgeting to create true community safety. To illustrate SPD's harmful actions, I'd like to read an excerpt from a legal testimony from a person identified as NG about their experience as a journalist covering a demonstration in downtown Seattle  on May 30th, 2020. Quote, on East Pine Street, I saw a truck playing music as protesters danced around it. It was an uplifting, joyful scene. I paused to observe and record a video when law enforcement threw a flashbang grenade into the crowd without warning. They deployed tear gas seconds later. The dancing protesters at first scattered but then coalesced back into a group. Law enforcement pushed them back and continued to deploy tear gas and flashbangs. I was shocked and frightened by the consistently unprovoked  aggressive use of force by law enforcement officers and multiple different groups of peaceful protesters. I saw no evidence that any of these severe crowd dispersal tactics were warranted, and there was never any warning before they were deployed. At this point, I decided to leave the area because I feared for my safety. There was tear gas everywhere, flashbang grenades exploding in the street, and I was anxious that the police would further escalate their tactics. I decided that reporting on the situation was no longer worth the pain of enduring tear gas and the risk of suffering violence at the hands of law enforcement.  Witnessing the aggressive and discriminant deployment of chemical agents and flashbang grenades by police at these protests has made me reconsider how I approach my assignments. There's a new element of trepidation, anxiety, and fear to my experience of being a journalist. I am determined to assert my rights and do my job, so I will continue reporting. But I would not be surprised if other journalists felt that their ability to report from the ground was significantly impaired by these law enforcement tactics.  This testimony is just one of many illustrations of the violent actions of a city that would be rewarded if council passes Bill 119981. Please reject.

I'd like to read a testimony of SPD's violence on August 16, 2020, from a person identified as NF. At approximately 10 p.m., NF was protesting at Spog headquarters on 4th Avenue South and Lander Street.  The police told protesters that they had four minutes to evacuate. They were directed down an alleyway. As NF backed up, the police charged forward. Someone tripped behind NF, and as they were backing up, they were caused to trip and fall to the ground. NF was arrested before they could stand up. NF was cuffed while on the ground, remained on the ground for about five minutes, and then waited 30 more minutes on the curb before being transported to the West Precinct.  They were handcuffed tightly with hands behind their back and the backs of their hands pressed together. They were held in those handcuffs for two hours and informed officers that their arm was hurt, but nothing was done. When they arrived to the county jail, they realized they could not bend or raise their left arm. When NS reported the injury to the jail nurse, the nurse did not examine NS arms and failed to detect what medical providers later found. The NS arm was broken. On August 17th, 2020,  Basically, the next day at 10 p.m., they were released, they sought medical treatment, and x-rays revealed a radial head fracture at the elbow. So NF's arresting charge was failure to disperse. Prosecutors declined to file any charges. As a direct and proximate result of the excessive force used on them by the city and SPD, the unlawful arrest and the unlawful treatment at King County Jail, NF suffered pain, trauma, and other damages.

It's sickening to listen to this, to understand that we're still here and we're still debating funding the police department, which has done all of these things.  We have had a year for the police department to demonstrate any signs of accountability, and we have seen nothing. We were told to wait for the accountability partners to do their work, and the accountability partners have done their work, and we've seen training referrals. We've seen a couple of written reprimands. We got an assistant police chief demoted, but there's really been no addressing the root cause of any of this stuff. There's been no reform. There's been no commitment to reform.  And we have the dubious honor of sending the largest delegation of police officers to the Capitol Six to the Capitol insurrection on January 6th. This is not a department that's trending in a good direction. I understand that you feel that the court monitor has told you you have to pass this, but none of you have to vote yes on this. And I don't know how you can even think about doing that. I don't know how you can think about giving them more money after hearing this stuff.

When the tear gas engulfed me on multiple occasions this past week, the words I can't breathe became more than symbolic. I personally and physically experienced what it felt like to have police violence literally choke me to a point where I was uncertain if I would remain conscious. This experience has affected every part of my life.  I can't sleep because every night I'm not at the East Precinct. I incessantly check Twitter and Facebook streams with friends and allies to ensure they are still safe. And when I wake up in the morning, I can't work because my brain has been on overdrive worrying all night. Headaches are a constant. Appetite is an all-time low. The pain and trauma of historical violence and oppression met with day-to-day violence perpetuated by the Seattle Police Department has coalesced into what I might describe as one of the worst weeks of my life.

But I also know that these protests are an important part of holding the city of Seattle and police department accountable. I do not continue to exercise my First Amendment right.

My name is Coco, and I'm an educator and District 4 resident who has experienced police brutality while exercising my constitutional right to protest. I join the masses in asking you to reject CB 119981. We must have budget accountability in order to have police accountability. If not from the council, then who? If not the council, who will stand up to the police who have terrorized  So many civilians, so many testimonies you have heard. What more do you need from us? We need checks and balances, and the buck stops here with you. While exercising my right to protest, I have been shot by rubber bullets point blank where I still have tissue damage. I have been gassed. I've witnessed police brutality countless times, including the police brutalization of a petite black woman whom I saw shoved to the concrete when the police moved in to attack a group of protesters.  She wore no protective gear. She was in shorts, pink sneakers, and a jean jacket. I filmed from my car as multiple officers piled onto her back and neck and screamed in pain. The police tried to stop me from filming and told me to drive on, but when I kept doing it, they broke my window of my car, dragged me out, and arrested me too. I shared a jail cell with her where she showed me her terrible pain and bruising, and she was super shaken because the police had also put their hands up her shorts.  In the course of our booking, I heard police officers ridicule her both to her face and to each other in side comments in a way that they did not do with white protesters. Meanwhile, in the U District where I live, we are hustling to meet our unhealthy neighbors' most basic needs, water, food, tents, sleeping bags, and supplies for food. When the smoke came, that was us. When the heat is coming back, we're going to have to figure out how to do this again. Like, we didn't have cooling centers last time.  We were knocking snow off of tents and trying to hustle new tents.

So, thank you. So, colleagues, this bill lifts the proviso on some of the  Participatory budgeting funding and directs the Office of Civil Rights to begin engaging with community members to draft a request for proposal. That RFP will begin the search for an organization that will manage the actual participatory budgeting process.  An RFP would allow for an open and transparent process, gives our organizations the opportunity to bid on the work, and will lead to a more equitable outcome for our community members. I have to say I'm really excited to be getting this project started and to listen to our neighbors' calls for a seat at the table about how our public dollars get spent.  We did hear in my committee last week that OCR will be working with community members this year to find the right organization to launch participatory budgeting. Next year, community members will begin to brainstorm ideas for how investments should be made. In my committee meeting, we heard from two guests, Councilmember Menchaca from New York City,  who said about their experience in New York that people were really hungry to connect to their government, to share the ideas that they have, and that once people started seeing their ideas were being listened to, once they began to understand the cost of a program or project,  They no longer felt outside of government, but really began to understand how the government works. And it also brought their neighborhoods together. People started teaching one another about how these processes work. That's the potential of participatory budgeting. It's about democratizing access to power and resources, and it's about increasing civic engagement. So our neighbors understand how these processes work and understand that their representatives are listening.  We also heard from Sean Good, who we've heard from before. He's with Choose 180. And Sean, I think, said something really important, which is that the $28 million we're talking about here  won't begin to make up for the economic inequality in some of our neighborhoods. It won't begin to address the injustices or gentrification that our communities of color have experienced. But what it will do is begin to blaze a trail that speaks to how we do this in the future and acknowledges that this is the right way to allocate taxpayer dollars so that those who have been pushed farthest to the margins can begin to have access to power and resources.  That's the path that we're working on today. That is the equitable way for us to address our role as elected officials. And with today's vote, that's what we begin to do. So I am excited to get this moving and look forward to my colleagues' support.", "start": 5434, "end": 5616, "Transition": "\"\"", "Meeting Section": "Other", "Speaker Role": "Other", "is_public_comment": 0, "is_public_hearing": 0, "is_comment_start_trigger": 0, "is_comment_end_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_start_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_end_trigger": 0}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_21", "text": "Great.

My apologies.  So just want to first off clarify that this legislation is not about the police department budget for officer hiring. The budget for officer hiring was fully funded in the 2021 budget adopted in November, nor is this bill about a particular number.  This bill is about council fiscal oversight of SPD spending. As background, the city of Seattle is under a consent decree with the U.S. Department of Justice. Any items covered by that consent decree require review and potential approval by the judge overseeing the consent decree.  and the court-appointed monitor, developments in this legislation after it was originally introduced were driven by the consent decree process and specific statements from the monitor in court about this bill.  In August 2020, the Council adopted Resolution 31962, that the Council will not support any budget amendment to increase the SPD budget to offset overtime expenditures above those funds budgeted in 2020 or 2021. Nevertheless, an additional $5.4 million in spending requests came from SPD in late 2020, and that did not align with the previous resolution.  So because council voted to add $5.4 million in funds in late 2020, contrary to our policy, did not do so. The council stated our intent to propose legislation to reduce the 2021 SPD budget. After this bill was introduced, Judge Robard, who oversees the consent decree, had sharp...  criticism of the council on budget issues. The monitor subsequently noted, concerns have been raised about the possibility of various cuts to SPD's budget, impacting the city of Seattle's ability to comply with a range of requirements of the consent decree.  In response to the judge and the monitor's comments, I sponsored a revised version of the bill on March 23rd, including nearly $3 million in cuts to SPD's budget, with $2 million going forward toward participatory budgeting and $1 million in spending moved from SPD to other departments and releasing a $5 million budget proviso.  Committee majority of three council members voted in support of this new version of the bill before the committee. It also allowed for funding for civilian positions and technology requests SPD made at the March 9th meeting.  Some have asked what those technology requests include. They include a new early intervention system in recognition that the system currently employed is inadequate. And that early intervention system is intended to predict and guide interventions for employees with signs that they need support as a way of enhancing police oversight of police officers who may be displaying troubling,  in the course of the work. It also included some data analytics platform and capacity building tools that will allow, among other things, for the analysis that we are all doing together, the council and the mayor and community members and the public, for analysis on 911 alternative responses.  New bill also provided funding for public disclosure response positions as recommended by the city auditor in his 2015 report and extensively reported on by the Seattle Times and called out by the Washington State Public Disclosure Commission director as problematic if left unaddressed. And also for evidence storage as recommended by the inspector general because SPD has insufficient space  for physical storage of evidence. Again, the majority of committee members voted to substitute the introduced bill with this new version. Monitor, meanwhile, asked a series of questions of the police department, and upon receiving the reply from the police department, wrote to the council,  that even after the committee meeting supporting the smaller cut and lifting the $5 million proviso, he wrote, court and the monitor are increasingly concerned about the reduction of funding to the Seattle Police Department.  In response, I proposed an amendment noting central staff now estimates up to $13 million in salary savings and releasing a $2.5 million spending proviso. Out-of-order layoffs based on sustained misconduct is not possible at this time due to the intersection of public safety, civil service rules, and state law. That's it. The legislation includes additional funds can be spent for training and  Again, as identified by the monitor. So that is the background and the description of the bill before us today.

I'm bringing Amendment 2 as an option for the council to consider and potentially a new way for us to think about a corresponding bifurcated strategy for how to consider our ongoing process of defunding the Seattle Police Department and reinvesting in alternative public safety investments. I want to say at the top that  You know, the amendment in no way implies from me a lack of commitment to participatory budgeting. I do not think that the money that has been apportioned already, the $30 million apportioned for the participatory budgeting process should in any way be reallocated from that process. Since we know in the legislation passed earlier this meeting from Council Member Morales that we will be setting up a very deliberative process with enough time to be  supplemented by additional appropriations on top of the 30 million, I would be supportive of putting additional money into that participatory budgeting process. I do bring this amendment for us to have a discussion and a conversation of ways that we might be able to, at the same time we are building toward that participatory budgeting process, make some more short-term investments in some other public safety programs  that we know are working extremely well and could be responsive to the massive need that we see in the community and that I believe has eroded confidence from some community members in our ability to be responsive to the public safety challenges the city is facing. And in a way that the police will not be, frankly, responsive under the investments that we're making here or under  some of the staffing investments through the staffing plan that we funded. The big issue as I see it, and like I'm digressing a little bit and talking more generally about our public safety policies based on the emails that all of our offices get, is that a lot of community members who are very compassionate are frustrated for a variety of different reasons, as well as some who are frankly not that compassionate, but are frustrated for a lot of different reasons with the state  of unsanctioned encampments and chronic homelessness in the city of Seattle, and with the inability of us as a city to provide an appropriate level of shelter and care in a way that is culturally competent, that is resourced for the actual issues people are facing, and that gives community members a contact or someone that they can call that is not the police to intervene in these kinds of circumstances.  The Just Care program, which we talked about last week and which I talked about at briefing this morning, is something that could be scaled to provide that level of response for every neighborhood instead of just the Chinatown International District and Pioneer Square, where it currently serves. There are plans to expand it under our American Recovery Act appropriations, but that still is not going to be to an extent where they can do the work they're doing on a citywide basis.  So I do just want to talk just really briefly, like a little bit more about Just Care. This amendment would move the $2 million instead of moving it into the participatory budgeting process, would move it into the procurement that we are pursuing with the county to protect and expand the Just Care program. As we heard last week, the Just Care program is composed of a consortium of providers, many of which are BIPOC-led.  You know, obviously we heard from Dominic Davis, who was on our panel, who works with the consortium to provide culturally competent security at a number of the hotels that the consortium leases. Asian Counseling and Referral Service is a foundational partner. The Public Defender Association, the Chief Seattle Club have all been a part of this multi-provider effort to really, really get into these areas  that have been the subject of public discourse around the public safety discussion, and resolve the underlying problem for all stakeholders involved. To provide safety, security, and healthcare to the people that are currently living in encampments, to provide a resource that is an alternative to the police from business owners, to intervene in some of these situations,  And it has been directly responsive to the issues that we're facing. I have concerns as we're a year into, and there's been a lot of retrospectives on the action that we are taking as a city to continue down this path of developing community-based alternatives, that council efforts are losing momentum in a lot of respects. It's because of  but as far as I can tell it, what my predecessor council member Bagshaw called the C test, the ability for people to see and understand what the alternatives are, how they're responsive to their needs, how it affects their daily life. I say this as someone who is uniquely positioned because I have constituents who have seen the C test. I have people who have reached out to my office that are not necessarily historic proponents of housing first and harm reduction, but they've seen it work.  and they've seen it be responsive to their concerns and they have the zeal of converts and they're leaning into it. This is the kind of momentum that will help to drive broader restructuring to set a new national standard of centering harm reduction, housing first, and culturally competent care as a replacement for militarized policing. I'm worried that if we're not able to quickly respond and give other neighborhoods that impression of some of these alternatives,  I'm worried that the inevitable inertia of things is going to lead ultimately to backsliding, be it backsliding that's ordered by a federal court who's impatient with the process or unconvinced of the merits of waiting for community investments that are taking a while to get off the ground, be it the backsliding of future mayors or councils. I am worried about losing the moment and just  you know, using this amendment more broadly to convene this conversation, that perhaps some of these community investments should be made out of order of the broader participatory budgeting process in order to build public will and in order to be directly responsive to situations where, frankly, people in these encampments are suffering from diseases typically common in third world circumstances.  being exposed to being victims of violent crime that we know recently culminated in a murder over the weekend of a neighbor who was unhoused. And we sit here with resources and money where we could continue to build on the work of standing up this alternative system that is citywide and that can be enjoyed by every neighborhood. Again, I do want to conclude that this $2 million alone is not going to do that.  But I do think we could start to set an expectation that as we expand and build out a just care citywide network of care, that that money should come from the Seattle Police Department. It is money going into what community members typically think and associate that the police department should be doing. I have lots of, I have a whole email inbox, as I'm sure my colleagues do, of people saying we need police to show up to this encampment.  And then have a whole colloquy with that person being like, you could have 50 police show up at that encampment. They can't do anything. The police cannot provide mental health care. The police cannot provide a referral to a shelter space. What the police will do is show up and say they cannot do anything and then drive on, which is another thing that is common in a lot of the emails I've had. Because they're telling the truth. They actually can't do anything when they show up to these encampments.  unless they can establish probable cause immediately for a crime happening right in front of them. And then if they do that and they put the person experiencing homelessness in jail, they're going to be back on the street in a few hours because the jail also cannot provide mental health care or treatment or the things that our homeless neighbors need to be successful. But Just Care can. And I think that we have an opportunity to have a conversation of putting this nexus in where in addition to funding  the broader cornucopia of things we're gonna invest in through participatory budgeting, that we also carve some money out to intentionally and strategically build a citywide just care network, that we do it at the expense of the police department, since it is caseload that is being transferred. I think there's a nexus and it makes sense. And maybe it won't be through this amendment, maybe it'll be through a different conversation that we have, but we're accumulating salary savings for officers that are leaving the department  that under the proviso that we set in the fall, I think we could be strategic with those salary savings to treat a citywide just care response system the same way we do treat the police department and the fire department as a permanent and ongoing institutional pillar of our public safety system.  that has the resources dedicated in such a way that they can build capacity and scale up and depend on that appropriation on a rolling basis. My amendment is a way to introduce that conversation into the discourse of what we're doing here at the council. I understand it probably won't necessarily be successful today. I am sensitive about the fact that it was previously earmarked for participatory budgeting.  And this would be rerouting it. And I acknowledge that I have a cognitive dissonance about that, and I'm not necessarily thrilled about that. But I'm also just saying this out of very sincere frustration, not with my colleagues here and not with the provider community, but just generally that there are resources, there is will to address these ongoing problems, and they seem solvable to me.  And we had that whole hearing with Just Care where it seems eminently solvable if the people doing the work can get the resources and support from leaders that they need. And, you know, maybe we don't do it here, but I did want to queue up the conversation. I appreciate your consideration. And with that, I'll, you know, yield it back to the floor for comments, questions, and appreciate the time to talk about it.", "start": 7096, "end": 7762, "Transition": "\"\"", "Meeting Section": "Other", "Speaker Role": "Other", "is_public_comment": 0, "is_public_hearing": 0, "is_comment_start_trigger": 0, "is_comment_end_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_start_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_end_trigger": 0}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_21", "text": "Thank you, Council Member Lewis.

But the idea of  Adding to a pot of funds that it is not likely that we will see those investments on the ground until 2022 at this point really, to me, underscores the need to look at where we could be spending dollars on programs that are on the ground  working and making a difference for all of our communities, our communities of neighbors who are unhoused, as well as communities of business people and residents who have homes. So I really appreciate the creativity for Councilmember Lewis here and the sense of urgency, really. I was at the SPD  African-American Advisory Council meeting a couple weeks ago.

I support increasing funding for Just Care and I also support the participatory budgeting funds. So I oppose this amendment which pits those two good programs against each other. Remember, this was a bill to cut $5.4 million from the police department's budget to make up for the $5.4 million that they stole from the city last year by spending more than they were authorized to. In amendment after amendment, this bill to remove  $5.4 million from the police department was then reduced to $3 million, and then a $5 million SPD proviso was effectively lifted, and then a $2.5 million proviso was effectively lifted. So now this bill increases the funds that the police department has access to by $4.5 million rather than decreasing it by $5.4 million. It has become the opposite of what it was when it started.  Why does the funding for just care have to be taken from the funding for participatory budgeting? It should come from the money allocated to the police department as has been promised by the council again and again. My office this morning consulted with a leader in the decriminalize Seattle  organization this morning about this amendment, which they said they had not previously seen. And they raised that this amendment obscures the fact that the police department's budget is not being cut and instead good programs are being pit against each other.  I agree with the arguments that Council Member Lewis made that Just Care is a much better use of funds than the police. Absolutely. But unfortunately, what this amendment does is take those funds from participatory budgeting, not from the police. I would be happy to support an amendment that increases funds for Just Care by taking the money from the police budget, not in the form of putting good programs against each other. And so I will be voting no on this amendment.  Councilmember Lewis expressed discomfort with what he called the cognitive dissonance of using funds that was previously planned for participatory budgeting. But let's be clear, that dissonance is particularly problematic because this bill as a whole no longer cuts $5.4 million from the police department. If that was not the case, then this amendment might have been different.

Are there any other comments?  or questions on proposed Amendment 2. Okay. All right. Colleagues, I just really quickly wanted to chime in on this particular amendment. I don't think that the intent of Councilmember Lewis is to  hit two good programs against each other. I see the intent and the desire here is to have additional resources to support a program that many of us have been very supportive of historically and I think will continue to be supportive of programs that are modeled after the Just Care pilot program. I think my concern with this particular amendment is  is that I do worry that what it would do is effectively take money that we had designated for participatory budget processes and ahead of  the designated process and the provisos that I sponsored last fall begin the process of reappropriating those dollars to a different use. So I'm concerned about that cognitive dissonance that Councilmember Lewis described in his opening remarks, but also worried that we have not done the necessary work with some of the impacted stakeholders to  ensure that they understand what the effect and the impact would be of adoption of this particular amendment in the context of the base council bill. So for those reasons, I'm not going to be able to support  the amendment in its current process and form and presentation. That does not mean that I am not supportive of Just Care and models like Just Care. I think we've all taken really strong votes and have taken important steps to make sure that that model is continued to be supported. And we, in fact, have  the Seattle Rescue Plan before us that was on today's introduction referral calendar that allocates no less than $49 million to additional homelessness and housing needs throughout the city. And we'll continue to have those conversations, not just as part of tranche one of those federal dollars, but as tranche two of federal dollars. And I just want to make sure that the viewing public understands that that  will continue to be an opportunity to meet the needs described by Councilmember Lewis, which I absolutely believe 100% of this Council is an agreement that we need to do and we must do more and more urgently to meet the needs of those who are unhoused and the impacts that that creates on the city as a whole. So for that reason, we're not going to be able to support this particular amendment at this juncture.  Any other comments or questions before Council Member Lewis gets the last word?

You know, I mean, another consideration that I'll just say here too,  I mean, for people who are advocates more about taking those savings and doubling down on, you know, increasing the resources for the police department. You know, the police department can only staff up so much in a given year. We funded their hiring plan for the year already. This entire bill has absolutely no bearing on that. Our provider community can staff up faster to do some of the public safety work that a lot of people clamoring for more police.  Um, don't know it yet, but they're actually clamoring for people like just care to get hired.

This bill has become a farce. It has been amended and amended until it now does almost exactly the opposite of what it initially claimed to do. It is the bill that formerly would have  removed $5.4 million from the police department for socially beneficial purposes. And now effectively, this bill increases the police department's budget by $4.5 million. As George Orwell said in 1984, quote, the Ministry of Peace concerns itself with war, the Ministry of Truth concerns with lies, the Ministry of Love with torture, and the Ministry of Plenty with starvation.  These contradictions are not accidental and nor do they result from ordinary hypocrisy. They are deliberate exercises in doublethink.\" This bill has become an important case study into how  the political establishment, including the Democratic Party, shelters the police from accountability again and again. When the police murder of George Floyd inspired a mass movement for black lives across the country and around the world, thousands of Seattleites took to the streets, tens of thousands,  took to the streets to protest police violence. Those overwhelmingly peaceful protesters were met with yet more police violence. Tens of millions of dollars in police overtime, tear gas, pepper spray, blast balls, flashbang grenades, airplanes with forward-looking infrared real-time video, and mass arrests were used by the police to essentially wage urban warfare against the people of Seattle.  In the context of the largest street protest movement in U.S. history, the majority of the city council, seven of the nine council members, pledged to support the movement's demand to defund the police by at least 50%. City councils in other cities made similar promises.  When it came to the budget, however, on the Seattle City Council, I was the only elected representative to stand with the movement's demand. Not only did the majority of the council, all Democrats, refuse to follow through on their pledge to defund the police by 50%, but also at the last council meeting of 2020, when the council was told that the police had overspent their budget by $5.4 million to brutalize the Black Lives Matter movement,  The majority of the council voted to retroactively give the police those $5.4 million extra. Again, I was the only council member to vote no. At the time, the majority of the council promised to take that $5.4 million from the SPD's 2021 budget to hold them accountable. And I warned at that time that that could not be trusted. And here we are.  Do council members remember their promises to the Justice for George Floyd movement? Do council members remember saying they support defunding the police by 50% last summer? Then do council members remember saying that they cannot defund the police by 50% in 2020 because reducing the number of police officers  would take up to four months, but that they promised to do so in 2021. Then do council members remember saying they cannot defund the police by 50% in 2021, because that would require reducing the number of officers in 2021. And before they do that, they will first need to research out of order layoffs. As a side note, doing police layoffs out of order was never a demand of the Black Lives Matter movement.  Then do council members remember adding $5.4 million to the police budget in December of 2020, but promising to remove it again in 2021? Now council members are saying that out of order layoffs of police are not possible and please forget that they ever promised to reduce the size of the police force and forget about removing $5.4 million that the police extorted in 2020.  Now, rather than a bill that has the police breaking even by cutting in 2021 what was added in 2020, this bill has been amended again and again until it actually adds the police's available budget. It cuts $3 million from the police budget with one hand and gives the police access to $7.5 million with the other hand by lifting two provisos. As Malcolm X famously said, if you stick a knife in my back nine inches and pull it out six inches, that's not progress.  Essentially, their consequence, the police department's consequence for going over budget last year is to get extra money this year. This is what police accountability looks like to the Democratic Party's establishment. Ultimately, this is about the power of mass movements on the streets. At the height of the movement, council members promised to defund the police by 50%. A couple of months later, that was reduced to just a couple percent points.  and a promise not to add that funding back at the end of the year. And a couple of months later, here we are. The lesson for our movements is that we must depend on our own strength and not put our faith in the establishment. Finally, I would also like to respond to the excuse that has been circulated that the council cannot defund the police without the agreement of the federal monitor. I want to be clear, council members vote on the budget, not the federal monitor.  and council members are responsible for their own votes. If council members agree with the federal monitor or any other part of the political establishment, that is their political decision, but it is not something that the federal monitor decides. The city council is the city's highest legislative body. I do not agree with the federal monitor or any part of the political establishment, and my votes always, including this one, will reflect that.  If council members were serious about defunding the police, they would pass a budget that defunds the police. What would Judge Roberts to place an injunction of the city budget as a whole? That's not realistic. So instead, we get letters from the federal monitor expressing concern and council members. Fear mongering that those letters are legally binding court decisions, which they are not, of course, if council members were serious about defending the police, they would certainly not be increasing the police budget, which is what this bill does now.  Working people will need to get organized and fight to win an elected community oversight board with full powers over the police, including hiring and firing, subpoena powers and policies and procedures. My observation from having talked to hundreds of people in a politically broad spectrum is that even the working people who are not sure about defunding also strongly support an elected community oversight with full powers over the police.  This bill is not accountability. It is the opposite. And if you track its progression over the last year, it shows the myriad of ways the political establishment protects the police from accountability. There are conservative politicians who openly advocate for police violence. There are liberal politicians who pretend to be horrified by police violence, but always have an excuse for not following through on their promises. There are federal courts  who throughout history have defended the power structures of the ruling class against movements and ordinary people to the point that the consent decree against police violence is used to prevent grassroots efforts to stop police violence. This is what it means when our movement says we need system change. This is why I am a socialist.  I voted against the substitute bills in the committee that transformed a $5.4 million police cut to a $4.5 million police ad. Because those substitute amendments have transformed this bill, I will now vote no on this final bill.

I'm going to vote to support, and I hope I say this right. Please correct me if I'm wrong. I want to support Councilmember Herboldt, which means that she ... So you'll figure that part out, but let me just say what I want to say. I'm not going to ... I always respect what councilmembers who want has to share with us, but in the real world, we don't always have the luxury to just talk about the political establishment  or completely disagree all the time with a federal court judge or a court monitor. And sometimes it's just not realistic to just completely and decisively decide that you're going to wipe out a whole police department. We do have a charter that we have to uphold, whether it's one officer or 1,200 officers, we have to have something there. And I think what this council has demonstrated in the last year  is that public safety is community safety and community safety is protectors, not warriors. And more officers doesn't make us more safe. And I think we all agree on that. I don't think there's no need to point fingers and call names and be called a democratic establishment or whatever. So meanwhile, back on earth, I just want to say this, particularly to council member Morales, I want to end this chapter  Because I think it's caused, as you've all heard me say before, a lot of trauma. And I want to start the healing. And I think Council Member Morales, with her hard work and tenacity, is going to allow us not only to close the chapter, but to begin a new chapter with participatory budgeting. And I agree with the Council President. We're not pitting one idea against the other. Both can be true.  And it will continue to be true. And we will continue to do that because as elected leaders, we can't just pander to our base or to a echo chamber. We have to represent all of Seattle and the needs of our city. And if anything over this year, I think what we've learned is that we are going to reimagine and redirect funds from the police  to upstream projects to take away from the harm and the trauma that has happened in our communities. Everyone agrees about that. And for the first time, what we're learning is we're finally putting together a plan. It's not perfect, and not everyone will always agree. And I want to thank Councilmember Lewis for bringing this forward to shift the 2 million over to the Just Care.  So whether it's participatory budgeting, whether it's just care, these are conversations that we weren't having a year ago or six months ago. And now we are through the leadership of everybody. I am in the camp of closure, being decisive, being a leader, making a decision and moving forward and moving on. And I'm also in the camp  of believing in this great city and healing. And I think that's what's gonna happen today. That's how I'm gonna vote today. And I think we've all been through a lot and I don't think it does us any good to continue the divisiveness  We've all experienced different levels of frustration. And I think Council Member Lewis outlined some of that. When people come to us, call us, when they want camp removals, when they are upset about the homeless, when they're upset about the police. And I think that we've seen it in the city. Sorry about that. And we've seen it nationally, not just in this great city, but across this nation. And I'm ready to turn the page and get some stuff done.

And, you know, I think for me, this really does come back to the original intent of this bill, which had been  to hold the department accountable for their overspending. They've already acknowledged that they could absorb the reduction through salary savings. And if they find later that they have additional needs, they can always come back to council to request additional funds. And that's how we hold the department accountable. The only thing that  In their request that isn't new that we know that they are obliged to pay is the separation pay. And again, salary savings could cover this. So my feeling about this is that SPD created its own funding crisis when they decided to overspend on overtime last summer.  And giving the department more funding won't prevent crime. It won't address homelessness or reduce substance abuse. It won't improve mental health outcomes for our community members. Only investing in community services will do that. And so our goal, I think, which we share, should be investing public dollars in a way that can actually change community conditions on the ground so that it leads to better health and well-being for our neighbors.  And rewarding SPD for overspending outside of its budget authority won't accomplish that.

First, I'd like to commend Councilmember Herbold for her hard work as chair of Public Safety Committee and her work to craft a compromise on this bill. Even though I'm not in agreement on several elements of it, I just want to commend her for trying to work through this and come up with a compromise and echo many of the comments that Councilmember Juarez mentioned.  I have worked hard to be clear and consistent for my constituents and at this time I cannot support what I see as additional cuts to public safety until effective alternatives are in place.  This council bill is complex, especially with the amendments. But at the end of the day, it continues to reduce resources from our police department at a time when we are seeing record-breaking attrition of officers. So I will be voting no. I believe it's premature to label the loss of police officers through attrition as budgetary savings that can be immediately scooped away and spent elsewhere.  The record-breaking attrition of officers is alarming, and response times to priority 911 calls are too long. By the end of the year, I want to be sure the department has the funds it needs to hire more crime prevention officers, to retain good officers, to ramp up recruitment of diverse and progressive officers, to implement the federal consent decree and heed the warnings of the federal judge and its monitor, to increase training.  to return experienced officers to community policing work instead of working overtime on patrol. Yes, let's lift the budget provisos to free up some of those dollars, but not by ultimately cutting more with the other hand.  While the intentions were positive, I believe this bill has become a distraction since it was conceived six months ago. Despite the well-intentioned amendments at committee and today, I believe this bill sends an unproductive and negative message to the remaining city government workers in the public safety field who are already stretched thin.  But it also takes time and attention away from the most impactful task at hand for justice and reform, and that's revamping the unjust and flexible and expensive contract with the Seattle Police Officers Guild. So I look forward to getting back to supporting the work of our Labor Relations Policy Committee so they can revise the police contract in a way that's positive for the community, for the officers, for the budget, and for sustainable and systemic justice.

I, too, want to thank Councilmember Herbal. Councilmember Herbal, thank you very much. As chair of Public Safety, you have really taken the reins in shepherding this bill through your committee, and we know that that's been no small task, that this has been months of work, and it's been increasingly made more difficult when the chief and the executive offices have weighed in, when the judge and the court monitor have been weighing in. This legislation, I believe, was intended to hold SPD accountable for their overspending last year.  And our intent, as we described at the end of last year, was to use the council's power of the purse and the legislative branch, as we are supposed to do, to ensure that the executive agencies spend within the bounds of their budget and to make sure that there has been a reckoning or a balancing between this year's budget and SPD and last year's overspend. As we heard in the budget committee just last month, it is very highly irregular for a council to be asked to authorize spending after the fact.  And to have a retroactive authority granted should be something that is very uncommon and  happen very infrequently, but that's not been the practice here as it relates to SPD. Not only is it highly irregular, it's out of alignment with what we see in the state's RCW 3532A, where it says there shall be no orders, authorizations, allowances, contracts, or payments made or attempted to be made in excess of the expenditure allowances authorized in the final budget or is adopted or modified, and any such attempt in excess expenditure  shall be void. That's what the RCW says, but yet that's exactly what happened last year. And so the provisos that we put into place, we now know were ignored or dismissed by SPD at the time. And instead,  What spending was authorized for last year is our priorities that the council did not want to see prioritized. And what it left on the table for funding was things that the council absolutely wants prioritized, like payment for family leave and benefits and severance. These are items that we could not simply just not pay.  So at the time, just as a reminder, the council authorized an after-the-fact authorization for those payments. That overspend total was $5.4 million, and there was a desire, and I think there continues to be a desire by me, that this year's budget rectifies that overspend and that this year's budget corrects for the overspend that SPD created in terms of their debt from last year.  The $5.4 million number is not arbitrary. It comes from the following three items in last year's overspend by SBD. $1.9 million in FEMA reimbursement, $1.9 million in parental leave payback, and $1.6 million in separation pay. All of these things we knew were important to pay, but unfortunately those were left to be paid. Instead, the department paid money on items that we heard about during testimony today.  We've seen the videos and we've heard from firsthand accountants of where people had been met with excessive force for expressing their First Amendment rights at the protests that were taking place just a year ago this week. The testimonials today constitute, I think, a makeshift tribunal.  on what was experienced at the time of protests a year ago. And we remain, I think as a council, committed to making sure that there is accountability for those pieces, not only accountability for the overspend in the budget, but accountability for the situations that we continue to hear about  on a daily basis and that were outlined in today's public testimony. We remain in the midst of a federal consent decree that's almost a decade old now, and we also remain committed to addressing the call for action from the folks who have been calling in for over a year to make sure that we align, we realign our investments into things like mental health and case managers, making sure that homeless folks have social service providers showing up and that when there's a traffic infraction,  We don't have armed officers showing up for these things. The council has begun some very important efforts. A lot of those efforts led by Council Member Herbal through her committee and ongoing work in the budget last year. And I appreciate that those initial investments were made to realign our values to what the community has been calling for and to divest in areas that have been overinvested in over the year.  On this bill, I think that what we are trying to do is what we were trying to do is respond to the need to balance that $5.4 million addition that council was forced to make last year and to remove it from this year's budget.  And doing that while also having to respond to the calls from the court monitor and judge, I think have made this bill a little bit out of alignment with what we were originally intending to do. I disagree with the concerns and the fears cited by the court and the monitor, and I hope that the court and the court monitor  Do listen to all of the public testimony that was provided today through this quasi-tribunal that was offered via public comment, and that there's a careful examination of the central staff memo that accompanied the conversation around this bill. Notably, the council has not put SPD in a position where they are not able to respond to emergency calls or perform basic functions.  and the department does have the resources to fulfill the full hiring plan as we funded last year. Central staff's memo does the math. It shows that SPD's entire staffing model is still fully funded and that it is expected that there will be 13 millions in salary savings over the course of this year. I think it's important to continue to remember that SPD's hiring plan, as requested by the mayor and the department, is still intact and that it can be what was noted to be reasonably accomplished was fully funded.  Through the committee process, we've learned that due to continued higher than attrition rates, that $13 million in salary savings is anticipated. And I am hopeful that with this bill, if it does not pass today, that we can direct those funds, those 13 million to things where I think that there is common  agreement between what the bill offers and what I think we all would like to see. And that's more quick response and accurate and adequate response to the public records request, making sure more funding goes into community service officers, the IT needs, the physical storage of space. And even if we were to fund all of those things and fully fund the, and fully make the $5.4 million cut so that we could both fund just cares and participatory budgeting, there would still be over $5 million in unspent dollars at the end of this year.  I think today's testimony was very powerful. I think it's heartbreaking that the stories have continued to surface about the violence which folks have heard. And I do hope that this testimony from today helps to paint a full picture of the issues that we have been trying to address, trying to rectify in this year's actions and last year's budget. But unfortunately, on this bill today, I will be voting no because I am concerned about the $5 million proviso that's being lifted. I'm concerned that there's  not a full $5.4 million cut, though I appreciate that it's a near $3 million in cuts that's being suggested here. And I will continue to work with my colleagues here and look forward to continuing to work with the community to continue the path to make sure that we are  holding accountable the department that overspent their budget outside of what the RCW directs the department to stay within, and that we continue our efforts to reimagine and reinvest in community services and decrease the situations in which an armed officer is being required to show up. Again, the city of Austin, Seattle, New York, and Los Angeles are among the four cities that are continually held up  as being on the right path towards reimagining, and that work is not done, and we will continue even after today. But I appreciate the work that's gone into this, and I recognize the incredible obstacles that the good chair has had to address while considering this legislation, and really appreciate her work, and regrettably will not be able to support today.", "start": 9694, "end": 10178, "Transition": "\"\"", "Meeting Section": "Other", "Speaker Role": "Other", "is_public_comment": 0, "is_public_hearing": 0, "is_comment_start_trigger": 0, "is_comment_end_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_start_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_end_trigger": 0}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_21", "text": "Thank you, Council Member Mosqueda. Are there any other comments on the bill as amended?  Okay, colleagues, I just really wanted to quickly make some remarks as well. I do want to, like so many others have, start by acknowledging Councilmember Hurbold's hard work over the last several months  to make progress on this legislation and to try to develop a sound and well-reasoned approach to this particular budget action that the council has literally been considering since December. And so I do really appreciate her willingness, Council Member Herbal's willingness to engage all of the parties that have  expressed concern or interest in the legislation over the past several months. That includes community advocates, SPD and the mayor's office, and also the Monitor and Department of Justice representatives, as well as members of the Public Safety and Human Services Committee. And I think that the fact that it appears that almost all of the stakeholders involved in this budget action or who have interest in this budget action appear to be to be seemingly dissatisfied with the current version of this legislation  I don't think that that's a reflection on Councilmember Herbold's policy work and effort in the background to get us a piece of legislation that we could potentially support. But I do think it's a reflection and the result of, quite simply put, the deep division that exists in our city on the issue of policing and their budgets.  So I think, unfortunately, despite Councilmember Herbold's well-intentioned and thoughtful attempts to find a compromise solution here on this particular bill, I will be voting consistent with my vote in committee, which is a vote against this bill.  As I expressed during the Public Safety Committee's discussion of this legislation, my reasons for voting no on this bill are a little different. I feel primarily that it's premature for us to be making several of the budget actions that the bill proposes we compromise on, including cuts to the Seattle Police Department's budget that the monitor has raised significant concerns with.  I believe it's important that we have further engagement with the monitor to provide additional explanation about how this cut will impact or, more importantly, not impact the department's ongoing operations, specifically the staffing plan. It also, of course, lifts the $5 million proviso on the SPD staffing plan. In my opinion, I think it's still too early in the year to fully lift or begin the process of lifting the proviso in order to give SPD additional flexibility with their budget.  I'd like to continue to have, you know, we of course continue to have significant policy disagreements with leadership about how they manage the department's budget, including overtime. And so I continue to believe that this proviso right now serves an important role as an accountability mechanism. And it's my position that the council needs to retain this proviso, the $5 million proviso in place until later in the year so that we can effectively execute our oversight role and ensure the department is not expending resources in a manner counter to the policies  set by this council. So again, I think that more appropriate time for us to consider those lifts would be in the fall budget process when we have a better understanding and fuller context of what SPD's budget will be at the end of the year. We know that the executive will be back before the council with proposed SPD budget changes later this year. That's going to include costs associated with grant acceptances, special events, overtime costs, separation pay,  Paid family medical leave, reimbursement, these are all issues that may need to be addressed, may need to be addressed via a supplemental ordinance or through our ordinary budget process. So months from now when the council is making these decisions on SPD's budget, I believe we will have more flexibility to take more thoughtful action if the proviso is still in place and if any of the other provisos are still in place. So for these reasons, I am going to vote consistent with my committee vote.  which is a no vote on this particular version of the council bill. But do deeply appreciate everybody's hard work on this. This is not easy. And I know that we are all reaching our votes for some similar reasons and some different reasons. But I hope we can continue to move forward on this really critical issue together with as much consensus as possible. So with that being said, I'm going to hand it over to Council Member Herbal to close out debate so we can call this bill to a roll call.", "start": 10181, "end": 10449, "Transition": "\"\"", "Meeting Section": "Other", "Speaker Role": "Other", "is_public_comment": 0, "is_public_hearing": 0, "is_comment_start_trigger": 0, "is_comment_end_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_start_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_end_trigger": 0}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_10", "text": "Thank you. Sorry about that. So closing out the discussion, first want to respond to a number of the comments I heard from folks during public testimony speaking to their experiences with excessive use of less lethal weapons, which can be lethal. I appreciate the testimony and  regret these experiences in our city. I do want to say that this is another issue that is under the purview of the consent decree. The council adopted legislation prohibiting the use of most less lethal weapons. The judge overseeing the consent decree placed a restraining order on the council's legislation and criticized the legislation for not protecting public safety.  The legislation under the consent decree requires his approval. So just barreling ahead in this instant means that nothing has happened. We have no ban or regulations on less lethal weapons. Similarly, barreling ahead with the budget bill risks the same outcome, that no budget reduction will happen.  In my opinion, colleagues, your vote is not about a political win on either side of this issue. Yes, those who don't support any cut at all don't like this bill, and those who want the cut to be bigger don't like it either. But this bill is not about a number. It's about governing. It's about accountability. The objective of this bill is to exercise fiscal oversight of the Seattle Police Department while simultaneously funding important public safety investments in areas where there was broad agreement  and heeding the authority of the consent decree in these matters where the court is suggesting our actions overlap with consent decree obligations.  Nevertheless, this bill was voted out of committee with a do not pass recommendation with three votes in opposition to despite the fact that the majority of committee members, three members, voted in favor of the amendment on May 11th and in favor of substituting the original bill for a smaller budget reduction in March.  Over the summer and fall budget cycles, the council listened to people calling for a 50% cut to the Seattle Police budget. And we also listened to people who opposed it. And we demonstrated that we can listen to multiple voices in our city and compromise to meet our objective to redefine public safety in our city. The ability to listen to multiple voices is critical to change moving forward.  To Councilmember Mosqueda's point that requests for funding after the fact should be rare, I agree, but it's June. And these separation and technology funding needs were identified by SPD in February. If this bill fails, we are virtually guaranteeing that this dysfunction will happen again later this year. To Council President Gonzalez's point about the timing of the $5 million proviso lift,  Just a reminder, this is not a full lift. This is a gradual lift as we get reports from SPD. And respectfully, this was in the amendment supported back in March that we, the majority of committee members, voted in favor of bringing it in front of us. And if there was concerns about that approach, I would have happily considered a different approach had I known.  SPD's highest spending is during the summer. And as we found out last year during the supplemental budget process, most of the money will already have been spent. With your vote today, please do not allow both those who do not want us to exercise oversight of SPD's budget at all  as well as those who advocate for an all or nothing approach to revert us back to the status quo. If this bill doesn't pass, there will be no budget cut at all. So council members who wish to support the investments in the bill and the council's fiscal accountability over SPD, I urge you to vote yes.

I want to thank everyone for their ongoing patience and cooperation as we continue to operate this remote public comment system.  It remains the strong intent of the City Council to have remote public comment regularly included on meeting agendas. However, as a reminder, the City Council reserves the right to end or eliminate these public comment periods at any point if we deem that the system is being abused or is no longer suitable for allowing our meetings to be conducted efficiently and effectively. I will moderate the public comment period in the following manner.  The public comment period for this meeting was noted on the published agenda to be a total of 20 minutes, with each speaker having up to two minutes to address the council. However, colleagues, we have almost 100 people who have preregistered to provide public comment today, mostly on the suite of bills related to new tenant protections. Unfortunately, we will not be able to accommodate hearing from every single person who preregistered for public comment today.  So here's what I am going to do in order to facilitate hearing from as many people as possible. I'm going to extend public comment from 20 minutes to last a total of 60 minutes. And I'm going to reduce the allotted time for each speaker from two minutes to a total of one minute. So again, in order to allow for the council and members of the viewing public to hear from as many public commenters as possible,  We're going to hear public comment for 60 minutes. However, each speaker is going to only have one minute to address the city council. Speakers are called upon in the order in which they registered to provide public comment on the council's website. Each speaker must call in from the phone number used for this registration and using the meeting phone number, ID, and passcode that was emailed to them upon confirmation.  This is different than the general meeting listen line call and information. Again, I'll call on each speaker by name and in the order in which they registered on the council's website. If you've not yet registered to speak but would like to, you can sign up before the end of public comment, again, with the understanding that we are unlikely to get through everybody who has already pre-registered for public comment today. Once I call a speaker's name,  Staff is going to unmute you. You are going to hear a prompt of you have been unmuted. That's going to be your cue that it is your turn to press star six to begin speaking. Again, that is star six after you hear the prompt of you have been unmuted. Please begin by stating your name, the item that you are addressing, and as a reminder, public comment should relate to an item on today's agenda, the introduction and referral calendar, or the council's work program.  Speakers are gonna hear a chime when 10 seconds are left of the allotted time. Once you hear that chime, I'd ask that you please begin to wrap up your public comment so that we can have an opportunity to call on other speakers who have registered. If you do not end your comments at the end of the allotted time, your microphone is going to be muted. Once you've completed your public comment, we ask that you please disconnect from the line, and if you plan to continue following this meeting, you can do so on Seattle Channel  or one of the listening options listed on the agenda. I'm going to go ahead and open up the public comment period now. And before I do that, I want to go ahead and make the formal motion to extend public comment from 20 minutes to 60 minutes. So if there's no objection, the public comment period will be extended to 60 minutes. Hearing no objection, the public comment period is extended to a total of 60 minutes. And for the record, it is 2 10 p.m. So we will go until approximately  3.10 p.m. with public comment. First speakers that I have on my pre-registered list are as follows. I have Angie Gerald, but Angie, you are showing up as not present. If you'd like to give public comment, please double check your call-in information to make sure you're calling in to the right number with the number that you pre-registered with.  If you do show up as present on my end, I'll make sure to circle back to you and give you your one minute. Next up is Daniel Cavanaugh, followed by Jordan Van Voost.

We find that these entheogenic substances are incredibly valuable in the treatment of pathological rumination and psychiatric disorders. Not only do these medicines carry low to no risk of addiction and abuse, but are actually beneficial in treating the abuse of other substances such as alcohol and opiates. Based on preliminary evidence, these medicines exceed the success rate of the 12-step program.

The tenant has threatened him, saying that he's worried if my friend does move in, my friend's family, including his wife and two young children, might be chopped up and murdered.  Unfortunately, my friend is told the threats are too indirect to be used as grounds for removal. I've heard many people today characterize those who want to amend this bill as greedy corporations. And I just want to say, I think fundamentally it's a good bill, but it's more complicated than that.

As we said at that time, this was a victory for the renters' rights struggle, but it was also only a partial victory because the moratorium was extended to only three months.  I proposed at the time and the council unanimously agreed to delay the vote on the resolution until today, June 7th, because the eviction moratoriums are now going to expire on June 30th unless they're extended. Like in March, if the eviction moratoriums are permitted to expire at the end of this month, it will spell a real disaster for renters.  According to the U.S. Census Bureau's Household Pulse Survey, 270,000 Washington state renters have little to no confidence that they will be able to pay rent next month, which is 18% of all state renters. And 98,000 Washington state renters think it is very or somewhat likely that they will be evicted in the next two months. And already, as public comment testimonials have stated, and as I have said in my comments in previous weeks,  Data from the real estate industry in Seattle itself shows that rents are starting to skyrocket, starting in January already, and that they are projected to increase at a greater rate than the rents were going up in the pre-pandemic period.  Renters are facing a dire situation, both in terms of keeping up with current rent, not to mention the debt that they have been forced to accumulate. We have fought for and won the right to a lawyer for renters facing eviction, eviction defenses for renters, and rental assistance money. All of those are extremely important, but none of them are an excuse to fail to extend the eviction moratorium. When the eviction moratorium ends, literally thousands of Seattle renters  could be served with eviction paperwork, which is also known as unlawful detainers. An unknown number will self-evict moving before they are formally served with eviction paperwork. Then statistically, half of those actually served with formal eviction paperwork will be evicted by default because they are unable to respond to the paperwork or appear in court.  And only those who make it to the eviction hearing can avoid eviction using Seattle's eviction defense, right to counsel, and rental assistance funds. I oppose evictions because housing should be a human right. At the very least, however, the housing emergency renters are facing due to the economic shock of COVID-19 needs to be resolved before elected officials even consider lifting the eviction moratorium. This is a resolution.  It's a resolution urging Mayor Durkan and Governor Inslee to extend the eviction moratorium to the end of this year. I want to move the amendment and then I have specific comments about the amended version. So I move amendment one, which updates this resolution to account for changes over the past three months since it was last discussed. Can I get a second? Is there a second?", "start": 4665, "end": 4893, "Transition": "\"\"", "Meeting Section": "Other", "Speaker Role": "Other", "is_public_comment": 0, "is_public_hearing": 0, "is_comment_start_trigger": 0, "is_comment_end_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_start_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_end_trigger": 0}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_16", "text": "Okay, it's been moved and seconded.

The amendment adds up-to-date statistics and also language on recent community organizing.

We want some important policies in the state legislature, but to make sure those policies are effective, we need to ensure renters have time to catch up on rent.\" The amendment resolution also quotes from a Washington Low Income Housing Alliance letter stating, quote,  incredible numbers of renters are applying for rent rental assistance and it will take months to get the funds distributed lifting the moratorium and allowing landlords to proceed with evictions a month from now would be grossly irresponsible end quote frankly it is i agree with them it is not acceptable that elected officials would even consider lifting the moratorium before renters are able to get caught up on their past rent and stabilize their lives after this  unprecedented emergency. The amendment also accounts for the provision in Senate Bill 5160 that shamefully ends the eviction moratorium statewide on June 30th. But to be clear, while the statewide moratorium is scheduled at this moment to end on June 30th, according to Senate Bill 5160, there is nothing legally stopping Governor Inslee from issuing a new moratorium proclamation, and Senate Bill 5160 says nothing about the city's moratorium.  So I urge council members to support this amendment, updating the resolution language. I also urge council members to support the resolution as a whole.

This is the legislation from my office banning the eviction of school children, their families and educators during the school year. It is common sense, but there are also mountains of research showing that when children are evicted, it has devastating impact on their academic achievement and their development and mental health.  For example, the Losing Home Report found that, quote, of evicted respondents with school-aged children, 85.7% said their children had to move schools after the eviction, and 87.5% reported their children's school performance suffered very much because of the eviction, end quote.  In 2018, the state found that nearly 4,200 Seattle public school children were homeless at some point during the school year. That is a staggering 7% of all public school children. And in practical terms, it means that in an average class of 30 students, two will be homeless at some point during the school year.  This is a racial justice and Black Lives Matter issue as well. Just as Seattle landlords evict black tenants at much higher rates than other tenants, we also see that black students and other students of color disproportionately face homelessness. And we should make sure, of course, to understand the causal link between evictions and the likelihood of ending up homeless.  The losing home report also found that nine times out of 10 evictions result in homelessness. The 2018 state data found that fully 40% of homeless students were black and 23% of homeless students were Latinx, even though those communities constitute only 14 and 12% respectively of Seattle's public student population.  Preventing school year evictions will reduce at least this one form of systemic racism that is affecting our students. In the class of 2018, for example, 55.2% of homeless students graduated on time compared to 84.5% of students who were housed. So we see dramatic impact of homelessness and evictions on children's graduation rates.  The academic research into the impact of eviction and housing instability on students and children is also revealed. For example, the negative effects of instability on child development is a report published by the Urban Institute found that, quote, children experiencing residential instability demonstrate worse academic and social outcomes than their residentially stable peers.  such as lower vocabulary skills, problem behaviors, grade retention, increased high school dropout rates, and lower adult education attainment, end quote. And similarly, research shows that turnover in school staff significantly harms the school's effectiveness. And that is why this is such a strong bill where it includes not only school children, but all educator staff on public school campuses.  As I've said in the past, the eviction of children from their homes in one of the richest cities in the richest country in the world is a damning indictment of capitalism. But at the very least, the city has the power right now to stop evictions during the school year and should do so immediately.

First, I want to start with a thank you. I want to thank Council Member Sawant for all of the work that she and her team and the committee as a whole have done to bring forward this legislation for a vote today. I'm very supportive of the underlining bill, and I want to thank her for her work with me as I brought forward a potential idea for amendment 2.  We had some other ideas that we would have liked to include that we will continue to work on, and I'll make note on that here very soon, but wanted to do everything that we could to address some of the potential concerns that had been coming up for a very small sector of the community that has raised some concerns about potential unintended impacts to housing stability in the very rare situation that there is a homeowner  who has a financial limitation or other life circumstance that necessitates them to potentially move back into their homes. Colleagues, this is very similar to the very narrow situation that we have included in the just care statute that's already in effect. And the amendment that I have circulated for your consideration today, which is outlined in amendment number two, is trying to make sure that we are addressing this very narrow concerns and applying in  owner move in as an exemption during the school year moratorium. This has been discussed with housing activists and its rights organizations and members of the labor community. And I think overall, there is a broad understanding and desire to make sure that a this bill moves forward and is passed today, which I'm strongly supportive of.  B, that we continue to address the concerns that are coming up about potential misuse of any of the exemption statutes across the board, which I'm very committed to, and Councilmember Sawant and I had extensive discussions about, and we will continue to work on.  And see that if there is a situation that arises for these individuals who happen to be very small landlords with, you know, one of these housing units that they do need to move back into given their financial limitations or other hardships and life circumstances.  that we apply the very same language that we already have included in the other two pieces of legislation in front of us today and that we've already included in the just cause legislation as well. I want to be very clear that this just cause addition here that we're talking about is just for the owner move in as a just reason for eviction. This is not a loophole as there are many reasons that many owners may need to move into their homes including  life changes like the birth of a child, the loss of a job, which so many folks have experienced, illness or relocation. These cases, which we expect to be very few,  have meant that some of the owners who have some of these rental units are concerned about their own ability to have housing stability. The amendment would add in the owner move in exemption for owners to require them to give the 90 days notice and to make sure that they are adhering to the requirements within the just cause language. This narrow amendment is intended to be a response to those concerns that we've heard about possibly having instability in the housing market in those very few circumstances where  Some of these small, very small landlords are income restricted with one single residence that maybe they can't depend on that residence anymore and they, sorry, their income anymore and they need to move into their own family's home. We know that Seattle's high cost of housing, there are a few circumstances where the owner residents may not have the financial means to line up other housing options for the length of time potentially required in the legislation that's currently written. And so in these very narrow circumstances, we are hoping that this helps to create greater housing stability for folks  In this specific situation, I really appreciate that there is a ongoing conversation that we have begun to address here today with the legislation in front of us through the other ordinances that we're continuing to pass today.  And that there's a clear understanding that we need to make sure that our language around owner move-ins is strengthened, that we make sure that there's penalties for people who are violating any of these narrow exemptions that we have written into statute.  I noted earlier during council briefing, I am very interested in treble damages, making sure that renters receive triple the amount of their rent that would otherwise be paid to in the form of rent had they stayed in the place if there is any violation of the ordinance. And also that we seek to enhance the enforcement statute by requiring private right of action that includes any damages as well be paid to the renter.  I think that many of these things are on the horizon for us to work on, and they will apply broadly to the other tenant protections bills that we're considering today and the just cause language that's already on the books. So I know that there's much more work to be done. And I am hoping that in the case of this piece of legislation, unfortunately, we were not able to include some of the stronger enforcement provisions that Councilmember Swanton and I have been working on due to the time limitations.  But I am very committed to voting on this bill today. Did not want to hold it up. Greatly appreciate that it's in front of us today. Know how urgently needed it is. And in an effort to move forward this narrow provision, I am asking for your support on Amendment No. 2 with the commitment, with the full-throated commitment that we continue to make sure that there are stronger enforcement standards related to the department's ability to make sure that folks are adhering to our just cause language.  I do want to thank Erin House for the work that she has done with Councilmember Sawant's office and a broad swath of stakeholders, including from the tenants rights groups, labor organizations,  housing rights groups as well. I think there's broad understanding that alone this is not enough, that this moratorium, including language from this amendment, needs to be coupled with rental relief and repayment for small landlords. One memo that we received said that this moratorium is important, it's nice, but it doesn't stop rent debt from accumulating. Rent relief and other forms of monetary support will definitely help and is much needed, and that colleagues who are providing assistance for Seattle Public School students with immediate health  Safety and housing and educational needs show that rent and housing support is one of the highest requests where most of their money goes. So excited to pass this legislation. I'm hopeful that we can include this narrow addition here today. And we know that there's much more to do both in terms of improving enforcement standards from the department.  and also making sure that we do more with rental assistance, which we're teed up to do in the rental, excuse me, which we're teed up to do with the federal relief dollars, and we know we will continue to address in this fall's supplemental and budget process.

I really appreciate Council Member Mosqueda talking through this amendment with me in a very thorough manner, and I really appreciate  the commitment to not holding up the vote because obviously overall, I would say on renters' rights, the city has real work to do in terms of making sure that the laws we pass in favor of tenant protections are actually enforced. And so that's a larger conversation that I would really be interested in having and something that  I mean, my staff and I have been discussing with renters and renters, renter activists over the years. But as I've informed Council Member Mosqueda, I'm not going to be supporting adding this loophole to the school children eviction ban that would allow landlords to evict children in the middle of the school year in order to move themselves or their family members into the property. I agree that this is  very likely only a very narrow issue. And I also agree that if it's applied in such a way that only small landlords who are facing this specific difficult kind of situation, then you cannot characterize it as a loophole. But the reason I would be concerned about it is twofold. One is that I don't think it is needed because with little foresight, with a little foresight,  landlords should be able to arrange to move in over the summer so that they don't force a child to move during the school year because it it often also entails having to move schools in the middle of the school year and that's very that's an onerous burden to put on a child  And so in that sense, probably this may not arise very often, but I would also be concerned that it may not be used by genuine landlords. And again, that brings up the overall question of enforcement and the concern that an unscrupulous landlord might use a falsehood saying that they intend to move into the unit and they have no  And but that they have actually no intention of actually occupying. And then after the fact, it's impossible for the renters or nearly impossible to figure out and then follow up and and get reparations for it. And also, I think  This amendment would allow any building owner, not just small ones, to move themselves or their family members into the unit. So I still agree that it is probably not going to be very damaging, but at the same time, I would hesitate to be party to opening that door. And so that's why I would not support this amendment at this time. I really appreciate Council Member Mosqueda's interest in improving the enforcement in the future. And as I said before, my office has been eager to look into  renters' rights enforcement overall. So this is something that we would really be happy to follow up with you, Council Member Mosqueda, and any other council member who wants to look into this. And I also wanted to share with members of the public that  I've discussed with the small landlord who is facing a specific situation, which sounds extremely problematic. It is an outlier situation, but nonetheless, it seems like a very troubling situation. But the landlord also themselves agreed that it is an outlier situation. And I also wanted to express publicly appreciation for the small landlord saying that they really support renters rights as a whole.  and that they had some specific concerns and that they would be willing to speak out in favor of renters' rights as a whole because as a small landlord, they understand and appreciate the need for renters' rights to be strengthened.

So I look forward to that future conversation. Thank you, Council Member Swann,  continuing to push for broadening the enforcement element of this, which I will be there with you to further those discussions. I really appreciate also that folks are acknowledging that this is a very narrow situation that we're talking about here, infrequent situation, but there have been a number of emails that we've received. There's a few stories. One example of a correspondence that we received was a family who has been living with other family  But they've since welcomed a new baby and has always intended to move back into the home that they've purchased and don't have the means to both pay for mortgage and take on additional debt or housing costs. And I want to reiterate that this is intending to try to find stability in the overall market, though we are very, very clear that the overall intent of this legislation is  tremendously impactful, very strongly in support of the folks who have been advocating for this, from the housing and tenant folks to Seattle Education and Martin Luther King County Labor Council, really appreciate the strong coalition that's supporting this legislation today. And so this very narrow amendment is, again, from our perspective, not a loophole. There's lots of language that has already included this type of  This type of allowance, which also includes the two other bills that we're talking about today that look specifically at just cause reason for ending month to month agreements.  which is included in Councilmember Sawant's and Morales' right to refuse the legislation. That's also for a vote this afternoon, which I'm very supportive of. And we're going to be working towards a greater, I think, broader swath of making sure that all of our enforcement mechanisms are properly in place so that if there is any of these situations in which a lease moves automatically to a month-to-month conversion,  that the Just Cause Ordinance and other protections are applied, applied appropriately, and that we are strongly enforcing who is using any of these standards because this is paramount that we get this right. And we send a strong message to landlords that they are going to be watched if they are using any of these provisions.  And overall housing stability is absolutely the goal of the legislation and the narrow amendment in front of us.

Colleagues, for those of you who are not on the Renters' Rights Committee, I offered several amendments, which I believe would make this legislation better. I wanted to offer those amendments then, debate those amendments then at committee, rather than rehash them here.  But I do want to explain my vote on this. I agree with the sponsor of the legislation that evictions present hardships for children and families, and no one wants to have this disruption that leads to learning loss and instability for children. I voted in favor of numerous tenant protections during the past year, including the winter ban on evictions for low and moderate income residents, free legal counsel for those in need and facing eviction, and the payment plans for those negatively impacted by the COVID pandemic.  Today I supported the resolution to encourage another extension to the eviction moratorium to provide more time to have more rental assistance money flow from the federal and state governments to both housing providers and tenants.  Before joining the city council, I helped to build and preserve tens of thousands of units of low-income housing, and I worked at the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, helping to allocate billions of dollars to address homelessness throughout the country. However, I believe a more targeted, direct, and efficient solution is to fund tenant and landlord assistance for those in need, rather than adding another regulation that could be legally challenged because it leaves one party, the providers of the housing,  bearing the brunt of the cost. Regulating rather than funding the solution on a permanent basis is more likely to have a negative substantial impact, not on so-called corporate landlords that can absorb these costs imposed by the council, but on the smallest landlords in our city. So for the three ordinances before us today, I had offered amendments that would have exempted small landlords owning four or fewer units in Seattle.  Regarding this bill, 120046, this permanent bill that singles out educators for special rental protections, one of my amendments would have targeted the bill to assist teachers and substitute teachers and curriculum specialists rather than every single employee at the school who might not be involved in the direct education of children. My amendment would still have kept the special new protection for the school children and their families.  Another amendment would have made the bill more like the law from San Francisco, which limits the eviction protections to when it is no fault of the tenant who is an educator. But my amendment would have been broader than San Francisco's because it would have still banned the evictions for schoolchildren and their families. Another amendment would have changed this permanent alteration of landlord-tenant relations to an 18-month,  pilot program to determine whether it's effective or what its impact is. It's important for the general public to know that this bill is different from recent COVID relief bills because it would be permanent. I believe we should focus on getting targeted funding to those in need rather than permanently altering the contractual relationships that put the burden entirely on the housing provider. So to be consistent with my votes at committee, I'll be voting no on this council bill.

Are there any other colleagues who would like to make comments on this particular bill?  I'm not seeing any other hands raised. So I did actually wanna just add a little bit of context for the bill that we're about to be voting on. I wanna signal that I am very supportive of this particular piece of legislation. And as a reminder, I have personally sponsored legislation and we have all supported multiple pieces of legislation over the last year and beyond.  to provide additional rental assistance to people who need it in this space. So again, I think it's important to understand that in particular, some of these bills have identified funds, very much needed funds to address the issues related to students experiencing homelessness. And of course, keeping students housed has been something that I have personally championed additional resources for during the last three years now.  For example, our families education preschool promise levy includes for the first time ever dedicated funding to the tune of $600,000 a year to address the experience of student homelessness. We've also provided funding for childcare for families experiencing homelessness.  And we have added language, we added language to the jumpstart spending plan to require work with small landlords in addition to language focused on families with school-aged children. Our 2020 budget process ensured that there were additional dollars specifically designated for rental assistance to go to families with school-aged children of overall rental assist, for overall rental assistance  resources. So my support of this bill is recognizing that there is a holistic way for us to continue to support the needs, the housing stability needs of our families and kids. And yes, more rental assistance is needed. And yes, more dollars to allow for and invest in a family's housing stability is absolutely needed. But that isn't enough. We also have  have an obligation as policymakers to fix regulations when regulations are part and parcel of one of the causes for why that housing instability  begins and continues to pervade within our communities. So I'm excited to support this legislation, and I look forward to future conversations with all of you who have expressed interest in identifying additional resources to support families experiencing housing instability. One of the things that my office has been following very closely is spending on the Families Education Preschool and Promise levy.  And one of the things that we have begun to learn is that many of the dollars that we have identified to support specifically students experiencing homelessness have not been able to be spent at the level that we expected in large part because of at home  Learning so there will be an opportunity for us to potentially work together as a council to reprioritize some of those dollars to still meet the needs of students in our public school system, but be very nimble and quick with some flexibility as it relates to existing.  revenue resources. So I look forward to having those conversations with you all and to making sure that we address those concerns. So I'm excited to vote on this bill.

I just wanted to thank the committee members, council members Morales and Lewis for standing with renters in the committee and voting  against the amendments that Councilmember Peterson brought forward because they are not in the interest of renters.

Thank you.  Chair Sawant and Council President Gonzalez. I am excited to bring this before my colleagues. I do want to begin by thanking the members of the Stay House, Stay Healthy Coalition. We've been working with them for several months now, and I'm really excited to be bringing this forward at their request. And I do specifically want to thank representatives from the Housing Justice Project, El Centro de la Raza, Washington CAN,  Seattle block the LGBTQ allyship transit writers union tenants union real change share the city's the landlords solid ground and Lehigh and many many others who have been part of this work. I think it's really important that they are pushing us as a council for more tenant protections and really holding us accountable to our neighbors who rent in the city.  So just a little bit of background. According to the National Equity Atlas, county renters owe an average of $4,700 in back rent. Combined, approximately 39,000 renters owe $186 million in pandemic-related back rent. And we know that over a third of Black, Latino, and Native communities are burdened with rent debt.  These are some of the same neighbors whose work often requires that they are at increased risk of exposure to COVID. We also know that they are disproportionately uninsured, that something like a medical emergency during a pandemic could significantly affect people's ability to pay.  for food and childcare and other bills. These really are some of the essential workers that we've been talking about and hearing about for the last year. And the people without whom our city would have kind of fallen apart last year. So it's really important that we do what we can to help protect them.  We know that 58% of people facing a pandemic related financial hardship are low income themselves already.  Fifty nine percent are people of color and 71 percent lost employment related income in the last year. So when you couple this with the fact that in just a few weeks the eviction moratorium at this point is set to end you can understand the urgency to provide a defense to eviction for renters who have fallen behind.  because of a financial hardship. The impending avalanche of evictions is more than just an issue of money. It's a systemic issue brought on by generations of disinvestments. All right, that is Seattle Public Schools calling.  brought on by generations of disinvestment. And we know that this disinvestment in communities of color and our racist housing policies have really continued to haunt us. And that's part of the challenge here. We're trying to solve for some of these problems that are longstanding. So what will this bill do? This bill would allow tenants to assert a financial hardship defense at any time.  If you're a renter who's faced or will face financial hardship during the civil emergency, you will be protected. If a landlord does serve an eviction notice to tenants based on a non-payment of rent, they must include a statement that notifies tenants of their right to assert a defense based on non-payment of rent caused by a financial hardship during the COVID emergency.  Once in court, tenants will have access to representation now that we have a right to counsel legislation that we passed earlier this year. And as part of that right to counsel process, tenants are asked to self-certify that they are facing financial hardship. So following that certification, renters will be allowed to assert this defense.  As I've mentioned in council briefing this morning, and I do think that this is important to reiterate, landlords have resources available as well. King County Executive recently announced that King County will be offering close to $150 million in rental assistance to tenants and landlords. Here at the city, we are also offering just over $20 million in rent assistance.  So I think it's important that landlords are aware of that and that they access those resources before considering evicting someone.

It creates a defense to eviction, protecting renters from being evicted for being behind on their rent during the COVID emergency. It is very important, and at the same time, we should recognize it is not the same as canceling COVID debt, both renter debt and mortgage debt for working-class homeowners, which is what we really need to be fighting for, because renters would still owe that back rent. It will hurt people's credits, and sometimes,  People might even face lawsuits. But at the very least, it is extremely important that the city council pass this bill because it will mean that people won't be evicted and forced into homelessness for that back rent that was accumulated, that renters were forced to accumulate during COVID.  So I hope all council members will vote yes on this. And I also wanted to note that this is both an economic justice and a racial justice bill. Because of the endemic racism under capitalism, communities of color are facing far greater COVID-related debt burdens on top of the pre-existing debt burden discrimination and therefore are at a far greater risk of eviction once the eviction moratoriums end.  And on that note, it's extremely important that the city council pass this resolution, urging the mayor and the governor to extend the eviction moratorium. And we need to be following up with them to make sure that they actually do it.  and is followed by corporate landlords, reported that 31% of renters had unpaid rent. And the report went on, quote, the share of white renters with unpaid rent is well below the overall rate at 24%. Meanwhile, black and Hispanic renters are far more likely to owe unpaid rent with the rates of...  48% and 41%, respectively, end quote. So even the corporate landlord websites are acknowledging the disparities between white renters and renters of color, and renters of color are facing a very dire situation.

Again, while this legislation is framed as being related to COVID civil emergency, it would be permanent.

I'm going to just say some brief comments about all three bills. I reluctantly voted yes for the school year evictions, but not for some of the reasons that Council Peterson outlined. But mainly my main concern, and I did vote yes, is ultimately we do want to protect children and their families and educators. But I do feel like, as we were advised by legal, that there's going to be some issues on the definition and how broad that bill is. But nevertheless, I voted yes because I don't want to throw the baby out with the bathwater, so to speak.  However, on this bill, I cannot vote yes on this one. I think that my main concern with the whole slate here, and I think we heard this from legal counsel as well, also including the preemption arguments and the Reese and Berrien case, is that we really do need a comprehensive review of city tenant protections that work with state law.  And I think this pandemic field recession has really changed the landlord-tenant and, as we learned from legal counsel, the preemption landscape. So I think this piecemeal approach on long-term consequences is really going to be difficult to unwind. And so regarding Council Bill 120077, this is a defense.  So it is not correct to say that you will be protected. It means that you have a defense when you go to court. That doesn't mean it's going to be successful. I'm always concerned about raising expectations. So what you're going to have is somebody to come into court, assert the defense of COVID. That's why you couldn't pay your rent during the moratorium. That doesn't mean that a judge or a jury is going to buy that. And that doesn't mean that you don't get to walk away from responsibilities.  Of course, these are not passing judgment because all of us have been affected by this recession and what it's done, but obviously to renters. But a moratorium doesn't mean that you don't have to pay. It just means that at some point you have to pay later or you have to work something out with your landlord with notice. And so with that and what we've learned from legal counsel and the briefings that we've had and how it works with state law,  and the um i don't think it works with state law i think that's been was made very clear to us but um in any event i'm sorry but i cannot uh support uh this today thank you thank you council member juarez for um those comments really appreciate it are there any additional comments on the bill", "start": 7812, "end": 7971, "Transition": "\"\"", "Meeting Section": "Other", "Speaker Role": "Other", "is_public_comment": 0, "is_public_hearing": 0, "is_comment_start_trigger": 0, "is_comment_end_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_start_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_end_trigger": 0}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_16", "text": "Okay, I'm not seeing any other hands raised.

So this is about  providing some protection in the form of a defense so that there is at least an opportunity for them to have a discussion, to be able to work out the payments as Councilmember Moraes has talked about. And these are things that we have also been discussing throughout this year as we talk about how to make sure that there are different levels, different mechanisms in place for folks.  We have to respond to this impending crisis with the gravity that it deserves. We have to take action now so that renters who have faced a financial hardship  don't face eviction too. And as Councilmember Watt has said, we aren't saying that folks don't owe the rent. We're saying that while they are dealing with a hardship during this era, during this time, that there is some protection from them from getting evicted.

This bill, as I said, is jointly prime sponsored by Council Member Morales' office and my office and co-sponsored by Council Member Lewis. This bill creates a right of first refusal for renters to renew their lease unless a landlord has a just cause for refusing to renew the lease.  As I've said before, this issue has been discussed by the Sustainability and Renter Rights Committee since March, and I really appreciate Councilmembers engaging on this issue and appreciate being able to work alongside Councilmember Morales's office on this bill. We've heard as a committee from two panels of impacted renters and renter rights activists.  We also discussed two previous drafts of the legislation developed by our two offices, and through those discussions and technical feedback, it has become clear that what renters really need in these situations is the right of first refusal, where a landlord is required to give the current tenant the first chance to sign a new lease before offering that lease to any other renters unless there is a just cause.  Renters need a new lease long before there's any question of eviction. I mean, we've heard from hundreds of renters who've been in the situation or who are about to be in the situation and who are strongly advocating for the passage of this bill to make sure that Seattle Just Cause protections cover all renters. Few renters who are told by their landlord that they will not have their lease renewed  are going to refuse to leave because the law says they cannot be evicted because in real life renters will end up doing what's called self-eviction which is starting to look for a new place to live even though that they know that it's unjust and that they cannot be evicted because understandably they don't feel confident with having to potentially fight it out in court and in the course of discussing our bill in the committee we heard from dozens of renters who called in for public comment and several who testified at the committee table  who all recognize this legislation as basic common sense. And I wanted to express my gratitude to all the rank and file renters, not only those who testified publicly, but also who signed the petition, community petition released from my office, and just hundreds of rank and file renters who have spoken up about this issue. But I wanted to quote Star Willie,  who is a Starbucks worker and a trans activist who also testified at our committee who said, quote, as a barista in this city, I struggled for months to find an affordable apartment to rent. Now the apartment that I moved into has become less affordable each time I renew my lease because they raise the rent every year. I'm afraid each time my lease is up that they will refuse to renew my lease, essentially putting me on the street, end quote. And Matt Neely, whom I quoted earlier, a public school educator who spoke in favor of the,  ban on school year evictions, but also spoke in favor of this bill who said, quote, the first time that I was evicted, it was after living in the house along with five roommates through two full six-month leases without any problems filling rooms or paying rent on time.  After the conclusion of the second lease, however, our landlord abruptly decided that he would not renew our lease and that we would all be having to move out. The second time I was evicted, my landlord told us he was planning to convert our unit into an Airbnb and that we would not be able to renew our lease despite having no problems with us as tenants.\"  So this bill puts the right of first refusal into the part of Seattle's law, which is Chapter 7.24 of the Seattle Municipal Code. The Seattle Department of Construction and Inspections has the power to enforce. That means that if the landlord does not offer a new lease and does not have a just cause 60 to 90 days before the end of the lease, just cause that they, you know, that they can back up in court.  Then SDCI has the power to follow up, investigate, tell the landlord that they either need to offer a new lease or present a just cause not to. SDCI can issue a citation or a notice of violation and start issuing fines.  If a landlord refuses to follow the law, all this can happen before the lease ends. So ideally these issues can be resolved and the renter can get a new lease without anyone going to eviction court. And besides discussing with renters, we also discussed in my office with some landlords who contacted us. And as I informed the council this morning, several small landlords, we have spoken to support renters' rights legislation. Some even signed our community petitions.  But some landlords that we talked to oppose this legislation. One of the landlords made an argument to us against this legislation where he said that some renters are a quote-unquote headache and the end of the lease is a convenient time to get rid of the so-called headache renters.  But the fact is, over the last seven years, my office has supported many renters facing abuse from their landlord. So when I hear claims like renters are a headache, I have to ask what that means. I mean, this legislation allows landlords to refuse to renew a lease if they have a just cause to refuse to do so. But it's a question of having  being compliant with Seattle's just cause, the list of just causes to refuse to renew this lease, not just any headache. So in other words, if a renter reports a landlord to the Seattle Department of Construction Inspections for housing code violations or violating the renter's rights, that might be a headache for the landlord, but it is completely legal and just for the renter to seek redressal. And it's not a just cause to  kick out the renter. And as I said before, it is not a hypothetical example. This is a case that we've seen happen many times. Just in closing, in the initial remarks, of course, I'll speak in closing again, but last week, Council Member Morales' office and my office distributed four technical amendments to this legislation clarifying the language.  The amendments are attached to the agenda. None of them make any substantive change. And after Council Member Morales and Council Member Lewis make introductory remarks, we can move those technical amendments. If Council Member Morales wants to move those amendments, that's also fine with me.

Laura Morales, please. Thank you. I'll be brief. I do thank Councilmember Sawant for providing a good overview of the technical aspects of how this will work. And I think, you know, for 40 years, tenants have benefited from some kind of just cause protection in the city, which has been great.  But those protections offer no guarantee that their home will continue to be their home once their current lease ends. And that's what we are trying to solve for here. So this bill brings, I think, the best elements of the two previous bills that Councilmember Salma and I were working on. And much like the prior legislation, proposes a really simple fix.  that will ensure all tenants, regardless of where they are in their lease term or what kind of contract they have, that they'll be protected from a threat of no-fault, no-cause removal from their homes. It provides tenants the first right of refusal to either stay in their home on a new lease or a month-to-month lease or to voluntarily leave and also allows landlords to pursue removal if they have a just cause reason for doing so.  And then lastly, it does strengthen a tenant's bargaining power by allowing them to rescind a mutual lease termination in the case where they were pressured into signing one. So this is another way to make sure that we are keeping folks, our neighbors who rent, keeping some protections for them, extending protections from them, and also ensures that more renters in our city will benefit from tenant relocation assistance that is offered by the city.  So as we start to move through a recovery, as the emergency tenant protections are lifted, it's important that our neighbors who rent continue to receive some stability. And this is another way for us to make sure that that happens. I do want to thank Devin Silvernail on my staff. He's been...  trooper, really making sure that all these different tenant protections, the work that we're doing to try to protect our homeless neighbors, all reflect what we are hearing from community and from our houseless neighbors and from our renters in community.

It's really important that we have brought this bill to potential passage in a few minutes, and thank you, Council Member Lewis, for co-sponsoring. This bill is part of the  Overall, important victories that renters are winning today in Seattle as protection from unjust and devastating eviction. With this bill, we are closing the loophole as for decades left renters on external leases like a one-year lease or a six-month lease with zero protections at the end of the lease.  We, in this council meeting, we've passed legislation providing renters with additional eviction protections for rent debt due to COVID, eviction protections for children during the school year, and we've urged the mayor and the governor to extend the eviction moratorium. These are all crucial victories, but we also need to be clear that eviction is only one issue renters face. It's a very crucial issue, but in addition to that, we also know that renters are facing  unaffordable rent increases. And as far as the corporate landlord lobby is concerned, it's going to be business as usual now that vaccinations have been available and the economy is starting to go back to what seems like  little bit of a normalcy since the last year. But nationwide, we're seeing every time average rents increase, and this was pre-pandemic, every time average rents increased by $100, homelessness increases by 15%. It's a staggering causal link between rent increase and homelessness increase.  And rent in Seattle have increased by $100 many times over. So as I've informed the city council before my office has prepared several renters rights bills related to rent increases,  including rent control that we will be bringing to the Sustainability and Renters Rights Committee later this month. But first, what we have is a bill that we've introduced requiring landlords to give renters six months notice for rent increases, which has been a successful measure in cities around the world. So we won't be,  charting new terrain here. We will be following other cities that have already passed such a law. We also have sent to the city attorney's office for introduction a bill that creates relocation assistance for renters who are forced to move by unacceptable rent increases. And as I said, we've shared a draft rent control bill that will limit rent increases to no more than the rate of inflation.  and is devoid of the many problematic loopholes that laws in New York or California have introduced, which end up affecting renters badly and also damages the credibility of the ability of rent control to actually provide protections.  For the last several years, I've called for a renter's Bill of Rights centering around rent control, but also including all these other issues. And I thank Councilman Morales for also calling for such a Bill of Rights that is really important. And once again, I wanted to thank her in her office, everyone in my office. Specifically, I want to recognize Ted Verdone and Jonathan Rosenblum, who were part of really making sure that we had everything ready and making sure that we had all our  technical work and our organizing work ready to go. I wanted to thank Adam Zimkowski and Nick Jones and Sasha Somer also, and also the volunteers who have been working with our office and talking to renters around the city. I wanted to thank everyone who called in support of the renters' rights bills today and in the previous committee meetings. And I urge everybody who's watching to join us at the next meeting of the Sustainability and Renters' Rights Committee on June 22nd to begin  the discussion of the upcoming renters' rights bills.

Presentations, I'm not aware of any presentations, so we'll move to approval of the minutes. The minutes of the City Council meeting of July 6th, 2021 have been reviewed. If there's no objection, the minutes will be signed. Hearing no objection, the minutes are being signed. Will the clerk please affix my signature to the minutes? If there is no objection, the introduction and referral calendar will be adopted.  Hearing no objection, the introduction and referral calendar is adopted. If there is no objection, the agenda will be adopted.  Hearing no objection, the agenda is adopted. Colleagues, at this time, we will open the remote public comment period for items on the City Council agenda, introduction and referral calendar, and the Council's work program. I thank everyone for their ongoing patience and cooperation as we continue to operate this remote public comment system. It remains the strong intent of the City Council to have remote public comment regularly included on meeting agendas.  However, as a reminder, the City Council reserves the right to end or eliminate these public comment periods at any point if we deem that the system is being abused or is no longer suitable for allowing our meetings to be conducted efficiently and effectively. So as usual, public comment period for this meeting is 20 minutes and each speaker ordinarily has two minutes to address the City Council. We do have quite a few people signed up for public comment today, so we're going to reduce  the time allotted to each speaker to one minute. And we will have if there is no objection, we will have extend public comment period to a total of 30 minutes. Hearing no objection, the public comment period is extended to 30 minutes again at one minute for each speaker. Speakers will be called upon in the order in which you registered to provide public comment on the council's website.  Each speaker must call in from the phone number used for this registration and using the meeting phone number ID and passcode that was emailed to you upon confirmation. Please keep in mind that this number is different than the general meeting listen line call-in information. If you show up on my end on the public comment sheet as not present, I will make sure to announce that publicly so that you have an opportunity to go back  and look at your registration information and correct any issues that might exist with how you called in and from where you called in. Again, I'll call in each speaker by name and in the order in which you registered on the council's website. If you've not yet registered to speak but would like to, you can sign up before the end of public comment by going to the council's website at seattle.gov forward slash council. The public comment link is also listed on today's agenda.  Once I call your name, staff will unmute your microphone, and you are going to hear the automatic prompt of you have been unmuted. That's your cue to press star six before you begin speaking. Please begin by stating your name, the item that you are addressing, and as a reminder, your comment should relate to an item on today's agenda, the introduction referral calendar, or the council's work program.  Speakers will hear a chime when 10 seconds are left of your allotted time. Once you hear the chime, please begin wrapping up your public comments so we can move on to the next speaker. If you do not end your comments within the allotted time provided, your microphone will be muted to allow us to call on the next speaker. Once you've completed your public comment, please disconnect from the line and you can continue to follow this meeting on Seattle Channel or one of the listening options.  Okay, bubble comment period is now open. It's 2.06 p.m., so we'll go until about 2.36 p.m. Again, please remember to press star six. After you hear the prompt, you have been unmuted.

Howard Dale, District 7. OPA Director Meyerberg said last week that disciplining the four officers that did not enter restricted areas during the January 6th insurrection would, quote, serve to speed up the current decline of reason, objectivity, and fundamental fairness that plagues America. This is contrary to reason and fact. Many African-American SPD officers and hundreds of Seattleites have expressed fear and discomfort regarding SPD officers who attended the January 6th insurrection having power over their safety and lives.  This is so because of the undeniably high overlap between attending an event like that and harboring racial animosity or, at the very least, a high degree of racial insensitivity. SBD Policy Manual 5.01 actually provides forced sanctions against officers who engage in behavior, even off-duty, that undermines public trust in the department. Hence, Meyerberg did have a basis for finding that all six officers violated policy.  His office failed to investigate these complaints over the last four years, not just regarding January 6th, but other disparate treatment that SPD officers have meted out to right-wing versus progressive demonstrators.", "start": 278, "end": 345, "Transition": "\"\"", "Meeting Section": "Public Comment", "Speaker Role": "Commenter", "is_public_comment": 1, "is_public_hearing": 0, "is_comment_start_trigger": 0, "is_comment_end_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_start_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_end_trigger": 0}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_10", "text": "Thank you for calling in today.

This ban applies to any nation state that is a human rights violator.

Cox with a street naming in front of the future location of Seattle Jazz Ed's new home in the Rainier Valley.  Council Member Morales gave such a nice introduction. I don't have much more to add except that with all the incredible work that Clarence A. Cox did at Garfield High School, you'd think that would be enough. But instead, in 2010, he went on to launch JazzEd with me and our co-founder, Sharish Mulherkar, to ensure that all students had access to the life-transforming opportunity of music education.  At Garfield High School, despite the diversity of the student population, if you're familiar with the program, the bands themselves do not reflect the population of the school. And his goal was to ensure that students across the city had access to music education. And so JazzEd was launched.  in 2010, and now we serve over 1,000 students with significant financial aid to a very diverse population of kids. And we are so excited by the opportunity to be able to honor Clarence in this very meaningful way when we open our new building at the corner of Clarence A. Coxway  and 22nd Avenue South.

Despite several cost pressures, including the COVID pandemic,  Seattle City Light has surpassed expectations in keeping their rate increases under control. City Light also succeeded in not increasing the net utility bills of electricity customers this year when its customers were the most vulnerable.  Moreover, City Light's proposed rate path will also have a lower-than-expected rate increase in the future as compared to the previous strategic plan.

However, when it lists a projection of the rate increases over the next six years, it does not say who should pay those rate increases.  Since taking office, including as a previous chair of the City Council Energy Committee, I have consistently argued that the way City Light divides up costs between big business and regular Seattle residents is very regressive. City Light's formula effectively charges Seattle residents almost twice as much per unit of electricity as it charges big business. Several years ago, my office proposed legislation to change that, but no other council member agreed.  The utility does have a utility discount program for low income Seattle residents. But like all means tested programs that you need to apply for, less than half of eligible people in Seattle are actually on the utility discount program. So I'm voting yes on this City Light strategic plan, but I intend to vote no when there's legislation to actually raise rates unless those rate increases are paid by big business instead of regular working class Seattleites.

This was before the 2021 adopted budget was presented and before the decision between whether or not to repair or replace the West Seattle Bridge. The 2021 adopted budget anticipated additional taxable bond sales for the Overlook Walk and Aquarium Extension Projects and directed those proceeds to the same fund.  Now, Finance and Administrative Services, the department, has since determined that we can sell non-taxable bonds for the West Seattle Bridge repair, but that those bond proceeds will need to be held in a separate fund from the taxable bonds. This legislation does just that. This legislation accordingly, this legislation accordingly offers several technical corrections to the bond funds associated with the West Seattle Bridge repair work.

Thank you, Council President. Colleagues, as I mentioned this morning, I'm really excited about the legislation in front of us. Council Bill 121104 is an opportunity for us to move forward on developing affordable housing in a critical area of our city that has seen high risk of displacement.  This legislation also represents the first time the Office of Housing is utilizing the acquisition authority that I sponsored via an amendment to the administration and finance plan update in 2019. We as a council made the decision to adopt the amendment so that we could increase the Office of Housing authority to quickly act and move forward on purchasing lands of exactly this type for acquisition.  Again, in this year, in our acquisition and finance plan update in June, we now have not only increased the amount of funding the Office of Housing had, bringing that amount previously to $30 million, now the Office of Housing also has more ability to purchase properties like this in the future because we removed the cap.  So this is a really great example of that good work that this council did being put into action and examples of the type of future purchases that we will now be able to see via the Office of Housing given this council's authority to remove the cap on acquisition authority.  This property specifically, and I see Councilmember Herbold teeing up ready to speak about it in District 1, this is specific to South Park and the South Park community who has been working in collaboration with the Duwamish Valley Affordable Housing Coalition and Duwamish Valley Cleanup Coalition, Office of Housing, and the Office of Sustainability and Environment.  that is going to be working to create more affordable housing in South Park, using community preference strategies to help save off and even reverse some of the effects of displacement, specifically in the South Park community. This piece of the legislation also works towards addressing climate resilience in the neighborhood.  South Park is a neighborhood that is experiencing a high risk of displacement, and it also is an area, as we discussed in our committee, that is experiencing a disproportionate impact of environmental injustice in the community. This project and the legislation in front of us is responsive to those concerns and will help tremendously add value to the neighborhood at a site previously occupied by just a garage.  So let's turn that space into housing and more community assets. The timing of this legislation is also reflective of the urgency expressed within the community and an agreement the Office of Housing has begun to enter into with the community and the seller so we can be competitive in the purchasing of this property.  I want to note that acquisitions like this, in addition to the legislation that we passed in 2018 that prevents the city from selling off public land and underutilized land to the highest bidder, both of these strategies help bring in more public assets to the city, allow us to acquire and retain more public property that can be used for the public's good, like housing and community sites.  that is being considered here at South Park. Housing coupled with community space on the ground level so that we can truly create homes and a place for folks to continue to live, thrive, and enjoy in our city. So colleagues, I am hopeful that you will consider passing this legislation today. Again, it passed out of the Finance and Housing Committee  with a do pass recommendation unanimously as this legislation allows the Office of Housing to acquire two parcels in South Park for affordable housing development along with ground floor space. And again, this is a community supported project that will utilize these properties to create up to 100 family sized affordable housing units and affordable being defined at 60% of the area median income along with that critical community space on the first floor.  The community has asked the city to acquire the site and do an RFP for affordable housing development with community priorities in mind, which can commence as soon as we pass this. So looking forward to passing this today, and thank you for your support.", "start": 3769, "end": 4016, "Transition": "\"\"", "Meeting Section": "Other", "Speaker Role": "Other", "is_public_comment": 0, "is_public_hearing": 0, "is_comment_start_trigger": 0, "is_comment_end_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_start_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_end_trigger": 0}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_10", "text": "Thank you, Council Member Mosqueda, for that report.

South Park is such a small, close-knit community that they often say that they can literally put together a by name list of folks at risk of displacement. With the inclusion  of the community preference policy embedded in the request for proposals that will be developed with the community involvement. This acquisition can go a long way towards beginning to address displacement for that list of community members. I want to also give a shout out to the Duwamish Valley Affordable Housing Coalition for their long track record on developing community vision and for organizing affordable housing in South Park, Georgetown,  in the communities of the Duwamish Valley. This is part of a three-prong approach that we've done a lot of work on. I've gone to a lot of meetings about this approach, and it is specifically focused on addressing  displacement with the development of new affordable housing. They state, in partnership with a nonprofit developer, build new affordable housing for families, including displaced households from the Duwamish Valley. Second prong is a multi-purpose building, a one-stop cultural anchor where local families can access opportunities and resources, open space for gatherings and pop-ups, multi-generational space for learning, retail,  affordable child care and low-income housing units. And the third prong is the preservation of naturally existing affordable housing. They write, in the next two to three years, with the help of public and private partners, orchestrate the acquisition of enough units to impact the immediate rental area. The goal is to acquire 100 units in the Duwamish Valley. And there has been some work  on that third prong, partnering specifically with Habitat for Humanity on some preservation work there. I want to just also, in closing, thank the Office of Housing for pioneering this innovative approach to addressing displacement. And of course, thank Chair Mosqueda for her leadership in sponsoring the legislation that allows for the lifting of the cap for acquisition.
