The four contracts described in my email illustrate how flawed implementation of our best value policy has already potentially wasted almost $1.6 million in just eight months.  over competing qualified lower bids and appears to have chilled competitive bidding. This is real money. Failure to ask hard questions would be the height of fiscal irresponsibility. Ask yourself this, what are we getting for that $1.6 million? I recognize the community voted to approve best value. I had mixed feelings about it then and unfortunately it looks like some problems raised then have now occurred. It's your responsibility to deal with them. Look at the CA Hall contract. It's $755,000, three quarters of a million.  Higher than the low bid. Staff's using a five-factor scoring system for awarding contracts. I'll leave aside for now the issue of weighting items like worker development equally with cost and qualifications. Let's look at the detail. TA Hall scored 83, the lower bidder 80. That small scoring difference was a four-point difference in social equity and sustainability.  Ask this, what was that based on? Then ask, what are we getting for that $755,000? There might be good answers, but those questions need to be asked. Next, look at the August 837,000 AZ-SHMINA contract, 279,000 higher, 50% higher than the low bid. AZ scored 74, the other bidder 67.

On the Bailey contracts, unlike the typical multiple bids on large contracts of this type, this time Bailey was the only bidder. Last year, if you remember, Council Members Iyer and Rodina twice convinced you  to override staff recommendations to hire lower bidders in favor of Bailey. Two well-established local contractors with lots of past city jobs have said since they might not even spend the time and dollars working up bids if this process like that continues to be used. I can't blame them. And now it looks like no one wants to even compete with Bailey. So it appears in less than a year, implementation of best value has resulted in potential  much higher bids, $1.6 million, $2.5 million on an annual basis, and has completely eliminated competitive bidding of the work that Bailey likes to do.

The Robert and Irma Hayden House Historic District Study Committee finds that the proposed Historic District, Robert and Irma Hayden House Historic District, sounds redundant, has significant under National Register of Historic Places, Criterion B, as it illustrates the lives of persons significant in our past within a local, state, or national historic context.  I support this and hope that you'll vote in favor of this. We do have some other single resource districts within our city, Northern Brewery, Cobblestone Farm come to mind. This is a wonderful way to recognize, not just preserve, but recognize architecture and people and the history of our community. We have our bicentennial coming up in 2024. So I'm hoping that there'll be some other recognition similar to this  that will be highlighted as part of that as well. And by the way, I was on the Historic District Commission for six years, Chair for two, and on the Board of Cobblestone Farm for two years. So I speak from that perspective, but I speak here supporting this as an individual person.  I'd also like to thank the last caller for their remarks on that particular item. I believe two items, maybe. And I also want to speak about CA9. And I suggest that you pull this for discussion from the consent agenda. I'm not against it, but I think the discussion of it would be valuable to everybody. We have a $2 million contribution to the Affordable Housing Fund as part of the TUD, and they're looking  actually have 15 units on site, which would be the right math, I'm guessing. And the question is, as a community, what do we prefer? Do we prefer to have the units on site when we have these type of developments, or do we prefer the money paid in lieu?

She was involved in biking, not the Hell's Angel type, but in biking. She was a runner. She was a camper. She was a cook. She was a traveler. She was a mother and a wife and an academic, having completed her master's and was working on her PhD.  But as it said, if you want a job to get done, give it to a busy person. And we did. And I'm very glad that we did.

I had all those kids, so I had to speak.  and keep up with everybody and that's it.

It was a fight, it was not unanimous, but he won.  This is something you ought to do, have to do to stop the racist state of Israel from murdering more Palestinians. Larry Hunter was not wrong to push for a resolution to boycott the apartheid state of South Africa. And all those thousands of people who have approached you over 40 years to do the same against the apartheid state of Israel.  Those thousands of people are not wrong either.  Approve the seven-word resolution that you've been sitting on for so many years. Approve the resolution that says we are against military aid to Israel.

I'm speaking as an individual tonight. I'm on the board of Walk Like Washtenaw, but we haven't had a time to put together an organizational statement on your latest proposals before you tonight.  It's been interesting to follow the progress of this project, the sad progress over the last year. Walk Like Washington has tried to represent the public interest and tried to represent what's in Ann Arbor's and the university's non-motorized transportation plans and carbon neutrality plans. So far we haven't been successful, but we hope to be. The earlier statement, I hope you had a chance to look at what I sent you earlier today.  The WBWC statement from about a year ago talked about what's needed. Widening the west sidewalk on the bridge by about five feet and building the long planned trail loop under the bridge. Widening the sidewalk would allow room for bi-directional bike lanes and a pedestrian lane as an important part of a campus-to-campus bike route if we ever want to make a safe route between the campuses for biking.  However, a council by a 65 vote about a year ago directed the designer to proceed with a bad design, which would actually narrow the west sidewalk from 10.5 feet to 8 feet. Now you've been presented with a proposal which, as I understand it, would narrow it from 10.5 feet to 10 feet. So it's less bad, but it's still not good. And it's not what's needed.  One thing that I'm confused about in the proposal before you is the cost issue. It would authorize $2 million to widen the bridge by two feet, as I understand it. We were told about a year ago that it was estimated to cost about half a million dollars to widen it by five feet because of the need for an extra support beam. So it seems odd that we'd be paying more for less, paying three times as much for  or four times as much for less than half as much widening. So that ought to be clarified, what the issue with the cost is there. Also before you, as I understand it, the city would be paying the first 500,000, first half million, and then the university would pick up any additional one and a half million up to $2 million. If that's right, and if it turns out that the cost is only about a half million, then the city has been taken to the cleaners on this deal. I think you ought to look into that cost issue.  You know, we're on the verge of making a $10 million mistake on a long-term investment here when really we should do it right. And if we can't do the bridge right on a long-term investment like this, we should reject this proposal until we can do the design right and build it right.

When I was working at U of M, these were always treacherous crosswalks.  OK, treacherous, no matter what time of day or night. Now, the university, if they want what they want, they should pay more for what they want, OK, and not be subsidized by the Ann Arbor taxpayers.

So we do not have a good answer to that at this moment. Second question, can the signs that are currently placed on the sidewalks  instead be situated on the exterior walls of the bridge? Answer to that is yes, and the current design does accommodate that. Third question, how can we ensure that the new design follows best practices for traffic calming and Vision Zero principles? The previous mention of split lanes, for example, is concerning. In response to that, I would say that the design that we will undertake here  presuming that this is passed, will be reviewed by the city transportation staff and shared as well with the Transportation Commission for their feedback. The current design, as well as any future designs for the bridge, would not include any slip lanes. Fourth question, how can we ensure that the widening stops here, i.e., doesn't continue into the intersection and road beyond?  If any widening of the Fuller East Medical Center Drive intersection were to be considered in the future, it would be addressed as part of the capital improvement project for that intersection. And that project is currently listed as on hold in the recently approved CIP. And then finally, how are width dimensions arrived at?  The width of the bridge was determined based on adding a single 11 foot wide lane and maintaining the existing 11 foot wide travel lanes as well. And then a redistribution of the existing 10 and a half foot sidewalks to create the wider shared use facility that the design currently shows on the east side of the bridge.

We have a new university president who had expressed his desire to strengthen our town-gown partnership.  We have a new chair of the Board of Regents who lives here in Ann Arbor. And so, you know, I know many of us have had conversations with members of the Board of Regents. I just want to actually thank Regent Brown, who I've spoken with several times over the last couple of weeks, for his willingness to support our coming back to the table and finding additional resources, and for staff for pulling this proposal together.  I agree with with Councilmember Briggs that this is an improvement. I think there are still some questions. I do have one more as well. I know that these are cost estimates right now because we have  um we still have to do some of this this design work and and i'm looking at the resolution and it seems pretty black and white on what we are approving in terms of width and um and also cost and i guess you know i i've heard mr hutchinson i think you said that that we could potentially you know move that back to 10.5 feet or we still have the ability to add some additional um  Are we approving, do we need to potentially modify this language to say at least? Are we approving a cost estimate here? Are we approving 10 feet and 13 feet specifically? That's how it reads as I'm reading it. And if we were to go back to doing these estimates and it comes in under,  I would love for us to add additional width to that sidewalk as well, beyond even 10.5 feet. And so I know that that's not how things have been trending. But if that's how the money lays out, I want to make sure that we have that flexibility.", "start": 3908.569, "end": 4089.084, "Transition": "\"\"", "Meeting Section": "Other", "Speaker Role": "Other", "is_public_comment": 0, "is_public_hearing": 0, "is_comment_start_trigger": 0, "is_comment_end_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_start_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_end_trigger": 0}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_22", "text": "A couple of points.

The staff resolution, as I see it, is an important incremental improvement that goes a significant way in addressing one of the primary concerns raised by the Transportation Commission, pedestrian and cycling advocates, residents, and hospital staff, which was the narrowing of the sidewalk on the west side.  This new one keeps the west side at basically the same width while also providing two additional feet of space on the east side. That's good and important. Additionally, the university has agreed to pay for the additional widening associated with the pathways. This is appropriate.

They have told us that this is useful to accommodate it. I'm willing to credit that.

I don't know whether it's practical as a matter of geometry or practical as a matter of cost. I suspect the geometry is fine. I have no idea with respect to the cost. If we could reference a request to the administrator to pursue  barrier protection that if it were consistent with our cost estimates, I would be comfortable with that as an exploration. But to require it here, in my view and understanding, throws out the  earnest effort on the part of the university to reach common ground here, to themselves take on the lion's share of the costs of the city's change of direction.  and to facilitate what I think is an appropriate improvement, and that is to say the expansion from current condition of the transit on the east and to maintain, for all practical purposes, the transit on the west.

So I wanted to address some of the criticisms that we've heard in the community, particularly from a former council member who recently put out some information that's pretty anti-union, targeting this contractor, presumably because they happen to be a union contractor.  And we heard those talking points parroted by a public commenter this evening We did only receive one contract or one bid for this RFP that happens if you look back through the history of city bidding it happens with a Fair amount of frequency and there are lots of reasons for that contract there's only a  number of contractors that do this type of large work. And depending on what they're juggling and what might be on their docket and what else they might have bid, there are times when we only get one bid. The idea that other contractors didn't bid this because  The bid went to Bailey is ludicrous. Nobody knows who, as a contractor, you don't know who else is bidding for a contract until the bids are in. And the bids are scored, and the whole thing becomes public.  So it's, you know, it's disappointing to hear this anti-union rhetoric coming from a former council member. It's not surprising.

Sorry to say I'm not up on my American Poet History, but if you'll allow me, I'd love to read some of what was written in this about him.  Robert Hayden was born in Detroit in 1913. After a traumatic childhood, he attended Detroit City College, then enrolled in the University of Michigan in 1941, where he won a prestigious Hopwood Award for Aspiring Writers. What's that?  Oh, won it twice, wow, thank you. After finishing his degree in 1942, Hayden taught at U of M for several years and was the first black faculty member in Michigan's English department. He taught at Fisk University for over 20 years, but he and Irma, his wife, returned to Ann Arbor to 1201 Gardner Street in 1969, where he taught at U of M until his death in 1980.  During the tumultuous 60s, Hayden was criticized for refusing to call himself a black poet. He called himself an American poet, though he wrote some of the most powerful black history poems in the English language. In 1976, he was offered and accepted the position of poetry consultant to the Library of Congress, later called Poet Laureate, the first black American to hold this position. He accepted and was re-appointed in 1978.  I thought it was also worth pointing out that he moved to Ann Arbor in the 60s, and that was not without challenges for the Haydens, as it was for many black families. As the report states, when searching for a house in Ann Arbor, the Haydens found limited options. Housing discrimination against African-Americans was widespread, even though it was illegal. Another faculty member helped Irma and Robert find the Gardner Avenue house in Lower Burns Park, which they purchased in 1969. And upon their arrival, they were welcomed.
