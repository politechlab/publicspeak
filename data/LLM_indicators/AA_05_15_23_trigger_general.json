It is also known for our values, for our expressions, our constant expressions and affirmances of pluralism.  the diversity within our community wherein we know that we are well and truly stronger when we are together. And in connection with that, it is my great pleasure to honor the Asian Pacific Islander community within Ann Arbor, indeed, which is one of our strongest and most valued member groups.

Whereas the month of May has been selected as Asian Pacific Islander American Heritage Month to acknowledge the important historical events  On May 7, 1843, with the first Japanese immigrants arriving to the United States, and on May 10, 1869, the first transcontinental railroad completed with substantial contribution from Chinese immigrants. And whereas as of 2022, APIAs are the fastest growing population in the state of Michigan.  And whereas from 2010 and 2020, the APIA population increased in 70% of Michigan counties, with Washtenaw County having one of the highest concentrations of growth amidst one of the already largest members of APIA residents in the state. And whereas the 2020 census data reveals that APIA residents are the second largest racial group in Ann Arbor,  And whereas the APIA community expanded upon solidarity civil rights work with allies who share histories with black, indigenous, and people of color. And in the aftermath of the 1988 murder of Vincent Chin in Detroit, becoming the first federal hate crime litigated in an APIA victim. Whereas anti-APIA sentiment has increased exponentially in recent years.  and the Ann Arbor City Council has condemned hate crimes, hateful rhetoric, and hateful acts against Asian and Asian Americans in April 22. And whereas despite ongoing challenges, APIA community leaders in Ann Arbor, some of whom were arrayed here, others of whom we had the pleasure of being joined by at City Council, in Ann Arbor have committed to community well-being, health, and justice for all throughout their personal and professional work.

My name's Derek Miller, resident of Ward 4 and executive director of Community Action Network. I'm here today to advocate for the inclusive and transformative celebration of Ann Arbor's bicentennial.  As we commemorate two centuries of growth, progress, and community spirit, I urge you to consider the Southeast Area Park as a perfect location for a thrilling and much-needed splash zone or other park amenities. As stated in the resolution to direct the City Administrator to designate Southeast Area Park as the 2024 Bicentennial Park. Why Southeast Area Park? It is a beacon of opportunity for the residents of Southeast Ann Arbor, the largest concentration of low-income individuals in our city.  This community deserves not only commemoration, but tangible investments that uplift their lives. By choosing Southeast Area Park as specified in the resolution, we have the chance to create an accessible and empowering space for families, children, and individuals who may have limited recreational options. Moreover, the presence of Community Action Network, also known as CAN, in this area further highlights the significance of Southeast Area Park. CAN serves three under-resourced neighborhoods in this area, and these communities would directly benefit from the creation of this park and its amenities.  Ken has expressed his commitment to coordinating visits to this amazing amenity, ensuring that children and families who face economic barriers can experience the joy and respite it offers. But let us not forget that there is also still an incredible need for human services support in this area. Just today, Ken's largest food distribution at Bryan Community Center ran out midday and will not be replenished until Wednesday. Sadly, this has become a common occurrence by designating Southeast Area Park as the 2024 Bicentennial Park  We have the opportunity to address not only the need for recreational spaces, but also urgent need for vital services. We can send a powerful message to our community that our community stands united in supporting our most vulnerable residents. Moreover, Southeast Area Park's strategic location near multiple neighborhoods and various busing options ensures that families from different parts of the city can access the water park with ease.  Transportation should never be a barrier to enjoyment, and by selecting this part, as outlined in the resolution, we make a bold statement of our commitment to equitable access for all residents, regardless of their socioeconomic circumstances. Let us seize this occasion, the bicentennial celebration, to make a lasting impact on our community. I implore you to consider the long-lasting benefits, the positive impact on marginalized populations, and the opportunity to foster a sense of unity that transcends socioeconomic context. As outlined in the resolution,  to choose Southeast Area Park as the home for the Bicentennial Park and let us celebrate our history by creating a future that is truly inclusive, vibrant, and accessible to all.

I live in the fifth floor. I'm calling about something that I heard City Administrator DeHoney say at the May 9th meeting of the Ann Arbor Council Administration Committee.  This is a meeting that was broadcast audio only. It was not on Zoom, nor was it televised. Mr. DeHoney spoke about his plan for the city to build market rate housing next to City Hall. He had mentioned this when he gave his budget presentation to City Council about a month ago, but he went into more detail on May 9th. Now, I'm going to quote Mr. DeHoney. He said, quote,  Assuming that we get past the budget on Monday and Council doesn't say don't do it. Starting May 16th, I'm off.\" Then, Mr. DeHoney clarified exactly what the proposed development would look like.  Quoting Mr. De Coney again, he said, quote, it's high end, market rate, high level finishes. You want to charge as much as possible. You want this thing to generate as much cash as possible. That's why I did not say let's use it for affordable housing, unquote. Let me repeat what he said because it shocked me when I heard it. He said, and listen carefully,  It's high end, market rate, high level finishes. You want to charge as much as possible. You want this thing to generate as much cash as possible. That's why I did not say let's use it for affordable housing, unquote.  I'd like to hear more about Mr. DeHoney's plan, and I want him to explain how this fits into our city's need for affordable and workforce housing. We have a lot of high-end market-rate housing in our city already. Do we really want our tax dollars to pay for even more of that? I know I don't. What about you? Mr. DeHoney says his plan is a way for the city to raise money. He wants to put the same high-end housing on the Klein lot.  But I've seen the city play developer before, and we end up losing money on that scheme. Maybe Mr. Gahoney doesn't know about that. Somebody should fill him in. I think probably a lot of the new council members, probably everybody on council now doesn't know about when the city tried to play developer before, but it didn't end up well.  Instead, why don't we try to live within our means and realign our priorities? For example, Council Chambers was redone just seven years ago. Does it need to be redone again now with a mural on the ceiling, really? This is only one example. I'm sure we could find many more.

So,  Please don't have the police walking around downtown harassing people. And I think that it's, it's been enough years since the largest popular uprising in history happened around the George Floyd protests. There's been enough time around that, that we should have internalized the lesson that there are  that the police put certain members of our community in danger more than they help anybody. And that we should be looking for other better solutions rather than increasing police presence. So please rethink that plan.  and move forward as quickly as possible with the unarmed response program. Let's get that RFP out, make sure it includes things like a separate number people can call if they don't want to call 9-1-1, if they want to make sure that police don't show up to these wellness checks. 30 seconds.  make sure police are not involved in unarmed response calls, because that would make them into armed response calls.

The Nakba is the ongoing mass murder and mass robbery that is committed against the Palestinian people with your tax dollars every day by Israel.  In just the last week, you saw on the news Israel blowing down whole buildings, blowing down homes, murdering children in their beds while they slept. You saw all that on your TV news. This is what Israel does with your military aid, with your tax dollars, with your $3.8 billion every year. And the mayor here,  The mayor here has the balls to pretend that he's for minorities, he's for Asian-Americans. That's bullshit. What happened to Vincent Chin, where he was murdered with impunity, happens every day in occupied Palestine, paid for by your tax dollars.  So don't pretend that you are against that kind of violence that happened to Vincent Chin because Israel has created thousands of Vincent Chins with even more impunity than the killers of Vincent got. Even more impunity.  You, the Ann Arbor City Council, have thrown all your weight against every single resolution that tries to object  to the mountain of military aid that you give to Israel, even when that resolution came from your own Ann Arbor Human Rights Commission, even then, you threw your weight against all those Palestinian human rights resolutions. So don't even try to pretend you're against racism.  You are committing racist crimes against the Palestinian people every single time you turn your back and throw your weight against Palestinian rights resolutions. That's why I believe this city council is racist to the bone. Tonight you'll hear weeping and wailing about the Black Lives Matter yellow paint in the park.  Whoever defaced that, I hope, gets the maximum penalty for that, for hate crime and for vandalism, I hope. But good God, is that the maximum you have to give to the black community? A dab of yellow paint on the sidewalk? That's all you're gonna give to the black community after everything you've taken away?

I have been doing it for many, many years here. This city council wants you to believe they're anti-racist. They want to tell you that they love black people, but that's all garbage. They are liars. Their record shows that they do not want blacks in this town. This city has been gentrified.  30 years ago, this town had a vibrant black community. Today, that black community does not exist. They've been squeezed out. In fact, the old west side was wall-to-wall African-American black families. Today, you barely find any black people there. So when they tell you they love blacks and they love Black Lives Matter movement, they're lying. Another case.  University of Michigan, 50 years ago, promised 10% black enrollment. To this day, that has not happened. To this day, no one on this council or any other council has pushed University of Michigan to do good on their promise 50 years ago. In fact, University of Michigan is one of the most atrocious  when it comes to black enrollment. It is the lowest anywhere in the United States. University of Michigan promised 10% black enrollment. To this day, no one in this city council has demanded that they do it.  Come and do it. Make sure 10% enrollment of blacks happen. They never have. So you can see their record shows who they are. They are anti-black. They are anti-Palestinian. They are racist. There is no way you can sell this bunch to anyone and say they're not racist. They are racist. They are racist to the bone, as Blaine said, and their actions show it.  We will not be fooled by you, Mr. Mayor. When I call you a phony, it's because I know who you are and what you have done. Indeed, you are a phony, Mr. Mayor. And when you say diversity, your voice shakes because you yourself don't believe yourself. When you say you are not a racist, you are a racist, Mr. Mayor. Mayor Taylor, you are a racist.  Palestinian people are dying every day with the billions of dollars of tax dollars that the United States government hands over to Israel. Children die every day. Ms. America here knows it, and she told me that she knows that Palestinian children are dying.  Ms. Briggs, which I spoke to a few weeks ago, she says she knows that I am right when I say children of Palestine are dying with your tax dollars. She says, yes, I know.

She is absolutely correct. Second, I want to thank council members Garzi Edwin, Regina, Harrison, Watson, and Dish for sponsoring the resolution to designate Southeast Area Park as the 2024 Bicentennial Park. This park is both well used and very undervalued by the city, and I hope that we can change  Next, I'd like to ask the city to modify the fiscal year 2024 budget. First, we need to redirect some of that police budget to unarmed response. There's a $1.75 FTE increase for the police. Let's give that to unarmed response instead. Additionally, there's $800,000 on the budget for a replacement fire engine. This is great.  But I think that we should direct the fire department to purchase a much smaller fire truck, like we're starting to see in cities like San Francisco and London and Tokyo.  The current ones that we've got are massively oversized and do not fit on properly human scale streets, which just forces more impermeable surface in a new development, just because the only fire trucks that are available are these monstrosities.  And finally, I want to talk about the PUD on South Forest. I hope that this passes, but the fact that this has to be a PUD shows that our zoning is not working. This should not be a PUD. This should be a buy-write development. Let's fix our zoning so that more developments like these can happen buy-write.

Just briefly, I'm on the agenda to speak about the enactment of Resolution R-22-363. Six months ago, this body and five people who are sitting here tonight voted in favor of a resolution directing our city administrator to investigate the establishment and funding of an office of the ombudsperson for the city of Ann Arbor, which I think would take care of a lot of the concerns that people have, the community have, about the poor customer service here at City Hall. And that's not me making something up. It's in your reports if you read them.  And that resolution that was passed by the body resolved that the city administrator report back these findings at a regular council meeting prior to the finalization of the budget, which is tonight. And that didn't happen as far as I know. I didn't see anything about that. And I don't see a place where we're in the budget. Now we had, I know there's potentially like some short memories on here, but one effort of this body should be to see what the previous body had to do. And there should be some effort at continuity, especially when it's something that's for the good of the whole community.  So, you know, we'll write it off to short memories and hope that you have this opportunity to change and get that forward tonight. Otherwise, we're going to write it off to the considerations that maybe this body isn't trustworthy. Now, I got a chuckle when I heard the mayor stand up here and say that he stands for constant expressions of pluralism. And when I spoke at our last meeting, I was not unfortunately interrupted by these good advocates behind me to speak  about no US military aid to Israel. And I do not support military aid to Israel. And I would call for it myself. And I do not support military aid to any country. And the United States has been handing out $12 billion or so every year for the last decade that we know about in direct purchases or funneled through third parties. And essentially what the United States does with this money, Israel or any other country, is prop up the small arms industries.  And so when I go downtown and I see the moms demand action against firearms down there, and I say moms should be demanding action against all military aid anywhere, because all that is doing is propping up our small arms industries. We sent billions and billions of rounds of ammunition, millions of rounds of ammunition, everything, all over the world. It's disgusting. And that's just what we know about. That's the overt operations. So that this body can't come forward and make a general statement against war. If you're not working for peace, if one isn't working for peace, what are we working for here?  It's the basis of everything. And on this day, on May 15th, it's especially so. And so I want to apologize to the Palestinian community for not taking my opportunity when I sat at that table to bring forward a resolution. But as these folks have been pointing out for some years, you can see what I would have been up against there. So I doubt that it would have even been discussed. Now I got to comment on something. We got a big call to defund the police. The average police department has 2.4 people for every 1,000 residents. We have one.  2.4 officers, we have one officer for every 1000 residents. This city only has 97 police officers. Okay. They're complaining about the state, the police state. Yes, state power is a danger. Well, then no more military aid to Israel or anybody else. Get rid of the state power. If you want to defund the police, get the arms out of our community and out of the world."}, {"start": 2334.881, "end": 2337.903, "speaker": "SPEAKER_11", "text": "Thank you.

But you can't have a well community or safe community unless you have a well community. And we know well communities happen one individual at a time.  And the way we think about wellness is the majority, if not all, of our community members, our neighborhood members, are physically, psychologically, and emotionally healthy. We know food insecurity and housing insecurity is not a challenge in our neighborhoods. Well communities happen when we have robust transportation. It happens when we have neighborhoods that are as best as we can get at trauma-free.  And we have to make sure that we not only do that to the people that are outside that don't get impacted by our training and legal systems, but those that do. And everybody should have hope and the opportunity to be a contributing member of the community. And we know the impact of incarceration on folks and how it sometimes can derail them from realizing their own potential. I think $400,000 as a result of this excise act and the benefit from this excise act  is a small investment towards what we hope to be this continuing effort to put people on the path to contributing to the community, making our community safe by making our community well.

And I'd like to wear some different hats tonight, as I often do. As a landlord, I'd like to talk about E4, the Renter's Commission's recommendation.  Support your renters. They're the lower power people in the equation between renters and landlords. Some landlords have found workarounds. I guess the new laws for protecting renters are going to need some iterations, so please pay attention to the Renter's Commission and the recommendations as far as wait lists and other workarounds. Also, the Renter's Commission, I'll speak on E2 and E4 both, because the Renter's Commission  has advocated for sustainability, as has the Environmental Commission and the Energy Commission, and they all have resolutions before you dealing with natural gas for both heating and for appliances. And I'm sure you've read the details of those various resolutions. Whatever we do, we must do something more than what we are currently doing. And we must do so promptly. As they ask of you, please treat this  with the great urgency fitting a declared emergency. And as they ask, please, with equal urgency, implement carrot and stick measures to promote sustainable construction. As a landlord and property owner of multiple smaller properties, not any large projects, we're trying to implement various things and learning as we go. I just read another article today that talked about ways  that can overcome some of the hurdles we've been facing in our investigations on how to implement air source heat pumps into our properties. We're doing what we can, and I know a lot of people are doing what they can, and citizens are doing what they can, and citizen groups are doing what they can to educate ourselves and to improve what we have in terms of our existing housing stock. It is essential for our new housing stock to not  put us into a hole that we cannot fall out of if we're going to meet our 820 goals by 2030. So please, listen to those resolutions. Also, on C1, I'll put on my developer's hat. C1 is the 721 South Forest PUD re-zoning. Staff recommends that the PUD zoning district be denied because it's not consistent with the comprehensive land use plan. The proper process would be  Revise the plan for that area. You don't have to go to that area prior to considering a zone, something that doesn't and you need to do it for the area, not for an individual property. 1 property at a time. I know my time is short. I've experienced that as a developer. I had a good project. It didn't meet the comprehensive plan. I waited for the community.  a revised or comprehensive plan, and only then did they grant me the zoning. They did. They liked the project. The community liked the project. It works for everybody.

I'm here to ask you to approve C1, also known as the 721 South Forest PUD. If constructed, this will replace a 50-unit run-down apartment building and parking lot with a development that has 733 bedrooms, a couple hundred bike parking spots, and even some retail.  It's an all-electric building, just like we've been requesting from developers, and will provide $4.7 million to the Affordable Housing Fund. Despite being less than a block from other dense housing near campus, and advancing Council's stated goals of building environmentally friendly mixed-use developments to help alleviate the housing crisis, the staff report recommended against approval, and planning was split 6-2, but in favor.  I attended the meeting and read the documents, and the objections seemed to be that the project wouldn't be appropriate for the area by the letter of existing council policy. Maybe that's true, but it feels like it fits to me. On a recent bike ride through the area, I stopped in front of the parking area of the existing building, and I can see a number of taller buildings without really even having to squint.  A seven-story parking structure is basically across the street, and there are similar tall buildings another half a block away. The building would fit in the area just fine. I hope council approves this PUD today, but if you do, this tells me that there is a mismatch between what council and staff and planning believes is our policy on building dense housing close to downtown and campus.  Every time there's a mismatch like this, I think it's worth examining if there are simple policy changes we can make before doing the entire comprehensive plan to set reasonable expectations for these sorts of projects. I don't know what that would look like in detail, but I hope that there's something short term we can do akin to a quick build transportation project that doesn't require years of process to implement. Doing these as one-off PODs is pretty inefficient. There's got to be a better way. Please set some kind of policy.  so that we get what we want and we need.

According to the city administrator's comments at the most recent council administration committee meeting, this proposed luxury housing project could begin to move forward tomorrow. Yes, tomorrow, unless someone on city council makes a motion to amend the budget.  I have many questions about this project proposed by the city administrator, probably other members of the public do too. But my most nagging question is this. What are the ethics of building city-owned luxury housing as a source of city revenue in a city that so badly needs affordable housing?  An earlier commenter pointed out that we already have a lot of luxury housing, we need affordable housing. I would very much like to hear all City Council members weigh in on this matter. Many City Council members say very little during City Council meetings. So this is a chance to make your voices heard. Because if you remain silent,  Your constituents could interpret your silence as support for the city administrator to begin the process of planning for what he described as high and market rate housing that would generate as much cash as possible.

I'd like to express my support for amendments two and three of DS-3. These amendments will allow us to better support some of our most vulnerable neighbors in our local community. These resources are especially important considering we're seeing both increases in both acuity and the number of people seeking services over the past year.  This past winter alone, we saw an increase of almost 20% of those seeking overnight shelter, and now almost 70% of our guests we serve have a disability, more often than not being a serious chronic health condition, with many coming out of the hospital or other settings. These amendments allow us to target additional resources to returning citizens and those impacted by the criminal justice system, helping address systemic barriers and the impact of systemic racism.  I appreciate that these amendments highlight utilizing a trauma-informed lens as well, giving special attention to the incredibly challenging circumstances our guests go through every day, and the importance of bringing an empathetic and client-centered approach that focuses on addressing that trauma. I do want to point out one specific item in Amendment 3, recommending that the service population be expanded to not just those who already have a tenant-based voucher, but also to provide support for those returning citizens with seeking  obtaining and identifying a tenant-based voucher. That would broaden the service array, and I think the voucher process is really hard to navigate, so providing additional support on the front end would be a huge boon. I want to give a special thank you to Councilmembers Briggs and Harrison for reaching out recently over the last few weeks to explore ways to better serve some of our most vulnerable neighbors, and thank the entire Council for bringing these amendments forward to support  some of our most vulnerable neighbors here in our community.

I basically want to emphasize the harms and trauma caused by defacing the phrase Black Lives Matter with All Lives Matter. This altercation of the original message has significant consequences, and it is important to understand its impact. The phrase Black Lives Matter emerged to shed light on the unique challenges faced by black individuals in our society.  It aims to draw attention to systemic racism, violence, and inequality that disproportionately affect the black community. By defacing this message with All Lives Matter, the focus on the specific struggles of black people is undermined and dismissed.  Such an altercation not only fails to acknowledge the historical and ongoing oppression experienced by black individuals, but also perpetuates a harmful narrative that dilutes the urgent need for change. It dismisses the need for targeted efforts to address racial injustices and sidetracks conversations about the specific challenges faced by marginalized communities.  The defacing of Black Lives Matter with all lives matter disregards the systemic issues that persist and contributes to the erasure of the experiences, voices, and demands of the black community. It perpetuates a narrative that disregards the deep-rooted structural inequalities and reinforces the status quo.  It is crucial to recognize the harms and trauma caused by defacing black lives matter with all lives matter, and to engage in conversations that address the specific issues faced by black individuals.

So this site at 721 South Forest currently contains one five-story, 50-unit apartment building with 76 surface parking spaces. Approval of this ordinance will rezone the property from R4C to PUD, planned unit development, and will permit a 166-foot tall structure containing 228 residential units and 733 bedrooms.  The proposed structure exceeds the maximum height in the current zoning district by 135 feet. The units provided will be a mix of studio and one to six bedroom units. The zoning also allows a small retail space of less than 5,000 square feet.  As mentioned previously, the planning staff recommendation was no, and the Planning Commission voted 6 for and 2 against. That vote warrants consideration of the public benefits and relationship of the building to the surrounding context, but this is first reading, and I don't intend to launch a debate on the details. I just want to give you a quick overview of the features.  The PUD provides numerous sustainability elements. The building will be all electric. There will be no gas hookups except for backup gas generator. The building will be LEED silver. The developer will purchase renewable energy certificates that will offset 100% of the building's energy consumption for 10 years. Rooftop solar panels will provide 3% of what the building will use for energy.  The building observes and will be required to observe key tenets of passive house principles, such as to double the average of continuous insulation and utilize other measures to minimize heat loss. There will be just 98 vehicles parking spaces provided on site, two EV charging stations installed in the surface spaces, and 24 in the garage, which is two times what's required. There will be ground floor storage for 62 bicycles and an additional 135  Bicycle parking spaces provided in an enclosed area in the lower level parking garage. There are significant affordability elements. PUD regulations require a minimum of 15% of the total units be dedicated as affordable or a contribution in lieu of units. The petitioner has chosen to provide a cash-in-lieu payment of $4.7 million, which is $98,000 over the required amount.  In addition to that required contribution, plus some, to the city's affordable housing fund, the project will also make a voluntary contribution of $50,000 to the Ann Arbor Housing Development Corporation to be used for sustainability upgrades to existing or proposed Ann Arbor Housing Development Corporation properties located in the central area of the city.  The debate on the Planning Commission focused first on why this property should be a PUD. This is always justified by unique features of the site, and this site has a unique feature in that it is next door to an urban forest fragment. The developer has done a shade study and designed their massing to protect that fragment. That's written into the supplemental regulations. Council Member?

I do think it is incumbent upon us when this reaches second reading to actually have a pretty robust conversation around this. Obviously, it's not very often that we have a recommendation of denial by planning by our staff, and I think we need to go into debating why.  If this project truly has Has a community benefits that it needs to pass muster So just to read a little bit from the report in case you haven't had a chance to peruse it yet a site plan and rezoning of the parcel from our foresee to PUD rezoning is not supported by city planning's staff  And it doesn't support the project as presented for a few reasons, but one, the size of the structure, but also the fact that it can't be essentially, there isn't an opportunity to scale down the project as  would be appropriate as you are leaving a D1 or D2 district. What is I think perhaps most notable for me as we talk about the sustainability elements in this project is that OSI staff also does not support the approval of this project. And it notes that while the LEED silver certification is welcome,  LEED does not inherently meet the strategy goals of the A20 plan and in some instances falls short of what is needed to move Ann Arbor successfully toward carbon neutrality by 2030. The OSI will not recommend approval of this project if it did not meet net zero energy performance standards. It is recommended that the building achieve either passive house certification, living building challenge certification,  Lead zero and each lead zero category carbon energy water or waste So I encourage all of us to take a good look at this project and for the developer to consider You know why they are falling short on these options further discussion councilmember, Adina"}, {"start": 4472.412, "end": 4627.112, "speaker": "SPEAKER_24", "text": "Thank you, Mayor Taylor. As a student, I lived in U Towers at the corner of South University and South Forest back in my sophomore year, which was 2005 and 2006. At the time, I remember that building, which was constructed in 1965, was the only tall, densely populated, student-focused housing in that area. And if I wanted to live within walking distance of campus and downtown, my options were fairly limited.  A full year before I moved in, in 2004, almost 20 years ago now, the South University Area Association had already recognized a need for more housing and more growth in this area and had submitted a proposal to do just that. It still took another five years to adopt the A2D2 rezoning, which began to reshape South University's corridor and bring much needed housing growth to the area.  And now, here we are in 2023, still talking about the need for more housing in close proximity to campus and to South University. Housing that we desperately need to help alleviate our ongoing housing crisis, and the housing that will help to keep students within walking distance of their classes, downtown, and public transit that will allow them to attend the university without reliance on a car.  Finally, when I was out on the campaign trail, specifically in the North Burns Park area, I heard from long-term residents about their concerns with housing availability in the area due to more and more houses being gobbled up by landlords to use as short-term student rentals, driving up housing costs and impacting the long-term upkeep and quality of those structures.  This problem exists exactly because we as a city, and yes, the university, which needs to own this problem as well, has not kept up with the need for more student-focused housing immediately adjacent to campus. As Councilmember Briggs noted, there are a few items that still could be improved with this proposal, particularly around their environmental impacts and sustainability impacts.  But I would also be remiss not to mention that there are also some existing renters who would be displaced by this development. I am grateful to the developer for engaging it with the city and those residents to minimize this impact and help to secure additional housing and rental assistance. But if more can be done to help those individuals, I would certainly encourage it.  Finally, I will be supporting advancing this from first reading tonight because I do believe that this is exactly the location where more dense student-focused housing is needed. By adding 744 more bedrooms in an already densely populated, mostly student neighborhood, this will allow students to move closer to campus, closer to their community of peers, and could help to slow the proliferation of student housing out into other residential neighborhoods around the city, which continues to drive up our housing costs for everyone.

Amendment number three carries the power to transform our community. An investment in trauma-informed social services. These services have shown exceptional effectiveness, particularly when compared to conventional supportive services.  So, what sets Trauma-Informed Services apart? It's their ability to acknowledge, understand, and address trauma. They actively avoid re-traumatizing individuals and focus on holistic well-being rather than just treating specific issues.  This approach leads to safer, healthier communities, facilitating the reintegration of individuals involved in the criminal legal system. Leading organizations such as the Department of Justice, the Vera Institute of Justice, Urban Institute, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, and the Prison Policy Initiative have also recognized and supported the use of trauma-informed supportive services.  Their endorsement further highlights the importance and effectiveness of this approach in fostering positive outcomes for individuals and communities. Trauma-informed programs across sectors like housing, employment, mental health, substance abuse treatment, education, and family support services consider the pervasive impact of trauma and incorporate this understanding into service delivery, ultimately leading to better outcomes.  Data demonstrates the efficacy of trauma-informed services, with studies showing that these programs can reduce recidivism rates, improve health outcomes, and increase employment rates.  Moreover, the White House's Alternative Rehabilitation and Reentry Strategic Plan of April 2023 echoes our belief in the importance of trauma-informed care. It highlights the trauma endured within the criminal justice system, trauma that can lead to severe physical and mental health impacts, and creates hurdles for individuals trying to reintegrate into society post-release.  Our proposed budget amendment aligns with this strategic plan and the support of reputable organizations. By investing in trauma-informed social services, we address not just the symptoms but the root cause of the challenges faced by individuals involved in the criminal legal system. In conclusion, the effectiveness of trauma-informed social services over traditional supportive services is undeniable. They carry the potential to transform lives and communities.  So I urge you to consider this proposal and the positive impact it can have on our community. And together, let's build a future where everyone has the opportunity to heal, grow, and contribute positively to our society.

It's leveraging funds towards roads, water infrastructure, and programs that support our climate goals. I'm especially excited for the drainage study on gravel roads.  Many of those are in Ward 2, and also thank you to Councilmember Briggs, because she's also brought to attention the roads there in Ward 5, and the difficulty with city-maintained gravel roads and the drainage coming off of them. I've gotten multiple constituent comments about that, and I'm glad we're working to study those impacts.  The other thing I want to speak on in the overall budget here is the tangible investment in the black community that we are doing through the Housing Commission with our Catherine Street development. That's going to be 63 units of affordable housing. And the most important thing here, though, is the fact that the space is going to be programmed as a physical place to remember and to  to continue to commemorate the black community here. I have some words shared with me by Jamal Buffett, who is a member of the Community Leadership Council, a project specialist at Washtenaw County My Brother's Keeper, which is a group dedicated to supporting black men and black boys and just the black community more broadly. Mr. Buffett,  Bufford writes, the Community Leadership Council is comprised of residents and descendants of residents of this formerly predominantly black neighborhood. Aside from providing affordable housing for individuals coming out of shelter and artists, we want this space to have a constant presence of art honoring the rich black history from this area of Ann Arbor throughout the building. We want the first floor to be welcoming not only to residents, but also for the broader community.  We want this space to be used to address community needs, as an event, communal gathering space, to promote entrepreneurship and for skill building. We want black people in our community to begin to envision how this space can be a welcoming home. So this budget dedicates $325,000 to program this space and $150,000 to the Housing Commission to support BIPOC-owned businesses.

So this amendment proposes to appropriate $100,000 from the marijuana excise tax revenue to the Shelter Association of Washtenaw County. I appreciate Dan Kelly who called in earlier and is doing amazing work and his staff every day. Just a little broadly, the Shelter Association of Washtenaw County is the primary provider of services and emergency shelter for around 1,200 Washtenaw County individuals each year.  The association is housed at the Delana Center, which is in the 5th Ward, but obviously serves our entire community and county. It also provides additional daytime and overnight emergency shelter to individuals experiencing homelessness in the county during the winter months. Last winter, it operated five sites, including the Delana Center, a hotel offsite for those with acute medical conditions, a rotating shelter at the community congregations throughout the county,  and two monthly day shelters locations, one in Ypsilanti and the other in Ann Arbor. Last November, City Council approved $72,000 to the Shelter Association for winter emergency sheltering. However, as Mr. Kelly noted, the Shelter Association saw first a 30% increase and then it stabilized at around 20% increase over past winters in terms of need. And as he also mentioned, they're seeing a greater acuity of need  of folks that they are serving. So I am, you know, excited to be moving this forward in terms of providing additional support that can serve both the winter sheltering this winter, but throughout the entire year as well."}, {"start": 5814.617, "end": 5815.457, "speaker": "SPEAKER_11", "text": "Council Member Rodino."}, {"start": 5818.163, "end": 5955.953, "speaker": "SPEAKER_24", "text": "Thank you, Mayor Taylor. I am proud to be sponsoring this resolution tonight alongside Councilmembers Briggs, Cornell, Watson, and Ackman in support of the Shelter Association of Washtenaw County. This amendment directly invests in and supports the important work being done by the Delawana Center to provide shelter and services to our city's homeless population.  I want to make sure that, you know, Councilmember Briggs spoke about some of the work that this will help to accomplish, but I also want to address the fact that housing insecurity and homelessness is a crisis that disproportionately impacts marginalized communities. Most racial minority groups, especially African Americans and indigenous people, experience homelessness at higher rates, a direct result of historic and structural ongoing racism.  According to the National Alliance to End Homelessness, the most striking disparity can be found among African Americans who, according to 2022 data, represent just 13% of the general population but accounted for 37% of the people experiencing homelessness and more than 49% of the homeless families with children.  Additionally, I want to make sure we continue to acknowledge that LGBTQ plus individuals are significantly more likely to experience homelessness. According to the Williams Institute, 17% of lesbian, gay, and bisexual adults and 30% of transgender adults have experienced homelessness at some point in their lives, compared to just 6% of the U.S. population at large.  We know that the leading cause of homelessness is economic hardship, and the Institute's 2020 research also found that 22% of LGBTQ adults live in poverty in the U.S. compared to 16% of non-LGBTQ people, and that 8% of transgender adults reported experiencing homelessness in the past year compared to 3% of non-transgender lesbian, gay, and bisexual people, and 1% of cisgender heterosexual adults.  Homelessness is a complex issue and one size fits all. There is not a one size fits all solution. And that's why it is imperative that as we continue to address our community's housing and affordability crisis, we also continue to invest in and support the agencies and organizations doing the work to provide shelter and critical services to those experiencing homelessness.  Frankly, $100,000 is not nearly enough, but as we heard from Dan Kelly this evening during public comment, it will help to support some of our community's most vulnerable residents. For that reason, I ask for my colleague's support with this amendment. Thank you."}, {"start": 5955.953, "end": 5959.396, "speaker": "SPEAKER_11", "text": "Further discussion of the amendment?

We have food gatherers that runs the pantry, the Packard Health also offers the services. They work in coordination with SOS Community Services and the Hawk line, which we know from last year was really struggling.  You know, every dollar that goes towards this network of work from intake to temporary housing to diversion, even diversion, and trying to find counseling and helping folks see what options are available to them every night is essential.

And just taking this in the first part, which is the eviction prevention dollars, we allocated $305,000 toward eviction prevention earlier this year.  Mrs. Hall and the Housing Commission have allocated almost half of that money already. So that's how much need there is, and that's how quickly we are going through these funds. And because these families and individuals are on the edge, pushed there by rising food prices,  and other costs of living here. That money is able to stop them from facing eviction and facing homelessness and keeps them housed and creates a position where we are following that housing first model rather than trying to act on the back end and get people back into housing once they've fallen out of it.  I wanted to also kind of draw attention to kind of how this money can be spent. Mrs. Hall says that their staff can work directly with tenants, landlords, courts, the Hawk Housing line, and other nonprofits.  So I'm really excited that this money can go to such a direct need. And the other portion of this amendment is allocating $250,000 to youth services. There's low-income youth services, and those are places like community action network sites, Peace Neighborhood Center, and just any organization that provides services to low-income youth is eligible.  It's in the face of COVID and I think the mental health crisis and also just the lack of opportunity for youth to come together and enjoy what our community has to offer.

Can't, as council member Watson stated, can and similar organizations that provide youth programming have experienced significant cuts, especially during covid. And those levels have not returned to pre pre pre pandemic levels.  According to research from the After School Alliance, we also know that experiencing youth programming can significantly change outcomes related to mental and physical health, make one less likely to be a perpetrator or a victim of violence, and improves academic performance, self-esteem, and relationships.  However, BIPOC children are 10% less likely than white middle to upper class children to participate in after school or youth programming due to financial hardship. Therefore, with our city being the eighth most economically segregated city in the nation, I think that it is essential  that as these disparities increase, that we make sure that our children continue to have access and the ability to experience quality youth programming.

And we've spoken a little bit about right to counsel and seeing that work in other, in Detroit, mainly here in the state. And our starting discussions on the commission level,  But my hope is that as we see these funds move out, along the theme of what we want the marijuana excess tax to really work on, which is returning to communities most impacted by the war on drugs,  it seems appropriate to work on eviction because this is where we see families in crisis, where it's about, I think, an average of $1,000, $110 in back rent. We'll put folks out, put them in this process that it's really, really hard to recover from. So I just want to point out that it's backed by data, it's ongoing, unfortunate, and hopefully this marijuana tax revenue can alleviate some of that."}, {"start": 6711.503, "end": 6714.825, "speaker": "SPEAKER_11", "text": "for the discussion of the amendment.

I don't think it'll be much of a surprise to folks that I took a deep dive on how this budget advances our comprehensive moving together toward Vision Zero transportation plan. And I was very pleased to see that we have $6.5 million dedicated this fiscal year to specifically invest in our active transportation system. That's about a million more than fiscal year 23.  It includes things like street light replacement, crosswalk improvements, traffic calming, sidewalk construction and ramp repair, road configurations, accessible pedestrian signals, neighborhood bike parking pilot, as well as staff time to work with the Treeline Conservancy on the Treeline Trail.  This doesn't even count federal grants and earmarks that we're pushing for, nor does it count the investment that we put into infrastructure for people to safely walk and bike as we work on our road reconstruction projects. So I just wanted to say thank you to staff for reflecting those values in our budget.  I also wanted to comment on another topic. I don't think that it's part of our consideration and vote tonight, but I wanted to comment on the city administrator's idea to shore up the city's financial sustainability through the sale of the Klein lot and developing on the mezzanine plaza of City Hall for high-density residential development.  I think housing of virtually any kind is a better land use than a surface parking lot. And underutilized office space as well. So I really support us thinking in this direction. But I did want us to maybe urge some caution in regards to thinking about City Hall. You know, I understand that it's 50% occupied right now. We have this, you know, post-COVID work environment.  We want to retain our competitive advantage as a workplace of choice. So that means that we're responding to current expectations about hybrid work. And maybe it's here to stay with us for the foreseeable future. But I guess I would just want us to be pretty darn confident that it will stay this way, because it seems like once we give that space up, we can't really get it back. And I don't want us scrambling in 5 to 10 years, because we've run out of room for City Hall.

I don't believe that Mr. Dehoney wants to carry a real estate development project on his own and without input, so perhaps we could stop spreading that misinformation.  I think that when we talk about housing, we need housing of all types in the city. And I think it's entirely appropriate to consider market-rate housing for city-owned sites in tandem with developing city-owned sites for affordable housing. The either-or, or we need one versus the other, it's a false dichotomy that oversimplifies a really complex problem. These problems are a result of years and years of our legacy of exclusionary zoning. And they require creative and novel solutions  to increase our housing supply across all different types of housing. I look forward to welcoming new neighbors into our city as soon as possible.

I am honored to sponsor this resolution alongside my Ward 3 colleague, Council Member Ghazi Edwin, and our fellow co-sponsors to designate Southeast Area Park as Ann Arbor's Bicentennial Park. I will try not to repeat everything that my colleague just mentioned, although some of it might be worth renoting.  By selecting Southeast Area Park as our Bicentennial Park, we would be creating an opportunity for historic investment in a park that not only serves as a gateway into Ann Arbor from the southeast side, along both Ellsworth and Platt roads, but is also a critical community gathering space in one of our most socioeconomically, racially, and ethnically diverse parts of the city.  Southeast Area Park was the location of the first annual Black Asian Solidarity Picnic. It's where AFC Ann Arbor hosted Community Iftar last year. It is located in close proximity to the Bryant Community Center, to Creekside Court Community Center, to several of our city's housing cooperatives, and is a popular destination for residents all over the city, but especially for residents in Ann Arbor's Southeast Area neighborhoods.  Thanks to AAATA, which has a bus stop right outside the park, Southeast Area Park is accessible to residents from all around Ann Arbor and from surrounding communities. And while I know envisioning for what a Bicentennial Park could be is still ongoing and dependent on investment and securing private funding, we already heard about the possibility of a universal access splash pad.  which as a PAC member, I will note that increasing water access in our city parks throughout the city remains a priority. And this is not an amenity currently offered at Southeast Area Park. A possible sculpture garden paying tribute to indigenous people, a sculpture honoring former Olympians, community garden plots, additional parks programming, and possible partnerships with OSI to contribute to our climate goals.  I will note, however, that these potential improvements will not be realized overnight. The reality remains that if this amendment is approved, much of this work still needs to be accomplished by raising private funds. So I also urge our community to please embrace this opportunity to directly invest in supporting Bicentennial Park and an opportunity to invest in Ann Arbor's southeast side.  Finally, I just want to thank park staff for working with us to envision what this shift would mean and working with us to craft this resolution. I know I personally, as someone who lives relatively nearby to this park, see its use every single day, see how much it means to the community around me. And to be able to share that with the rest of the city and to celebrate this park in a way that it really deserves would be truly special.
