I received an email or actually a text message tonight at 637 from a DTE executive. DTE must be monitoring who's speaking.  Public comment making good progress miss dig and permit submitted working to expedite permit with city staff if all goes well We may be able to start work Wednesday or Thursday weather permitting this is regarding the mid-block crosswalk on  Fuller, that was a site of a fatality in 2016. I stood at this podium three or four times and begged the city to address the lack of lighting. The closest streetlight was 132 feet away. When the child was killed, the driver was not found at fault because a driver could not have reasonably seen the child in the crosswalk. I submitted a ticket on January 9th of this year after  The lights had been out for some time. Now we are getting to the point of contacting Mystic. I'm not going to go into all the details, but it is unconscionable for the city of Ann Arbor to not refer street lighting and illumination of crosswalks to the Transportation Commission. For some reason, it belongs to some other department somewhere that seems to be called Kathy Griswold.  We have to address this. So tonight I'm talking about DC one resolution to commence.  a collaborative planning process regarding the bridge. Obviously, we weren't collaborating and planning until certain people arrived on council. But anyway, given the projected cost increase of over $2 million, we need to look at this from a historical perspective and in the context of the greater need for pedestrian and cycling infrastructure in this community, especially crosswalk illumination.  So while we're working on tweaking this bridge one more time, we have hundreds of street lights that are out and hundreds, if not thousands, of crosswalks without optimal lighting, which is positive contrast lighting. So I've already talked about what's happened at Huron High School.  The DTE executive believes that it's two circuits that are connected to at least 35 lights. And these circuits, underground circuits, get damaged from all the development and digging and whatever we're doing. And so they may have to restring lighting. In conclusion, I was going to talk a lot more about the University of Michigan and how we're collaborating with them right now, but I'll save that  please light our crosswalks."}, {"start": 853, "speaker": "SPEAKER_08", "text": "Good evening. On January 27, parts of the world celebrated International Holocaust Remembrance Day. Actually, that was just the official day of remembrance. The real Remembrance Day is every day of the year, and if you don't believe that, merely create for yourself a Google alert on the word Holocaust.  The reason for this daily reminding is to fix forever in people's minds the eternal suffering and innocence of the Jewish people. Tonight, I'd like to focus on this alleged Jewish innocence, the innocence that is programmed into our minds by Hollywood, the media, campus, statues, and museums throughout America. We are taught that National Socialists of Germany wished to exterminate the Jews for no other reason than that they were Jews.  We are taught that Jews did nothing to deserve this alleged extermination and were like innocent lambs being led to slaughter. But maybe in 1933, Jews were not as innocent as we were led to believe. The headline of the March 24th edition of London's Daily Express read, Judea declares war on Germany. Jews in all the world unite in action. From the body of the article,  The Jewish wholesaler will quit his house, the banker his stock exchange, the merchant his business, and the beggar his humble hut in order to join the holy war against Hitler's people. And this international call to boycott really was against the German people. Jewish elites knew that the boycott would cause the starvation, the deaths of 30% of Germany's population.  A Jewish newspaper called Nasha Resch wrote, the war against Germany will be waged by all Jewish communities, conferences, congresses, by every individual Jew. Thereby, the war against Germany will ideologically enliven and promote our interests, which require that Germany be wholly destroyed.  Samuel Untermyer, president of the World Jewish Economic Federation, spewed falsehoods in his hate-driven speeches designed to whip up support for this Jewish-led boycott. He said, Germany has been converted from a nation of culture into a veritable hell of cruel and savage beasts. But in fact,  This economic war by Jews against Germany in 1933 occurred long before there was any such thing as sanctions or reprisals of any kind against European Jews. Innocent or warlike, as the Ann Arbor News said today, the past rediscovered. Thank you."}, {"start": 1042, "speaker": "SPEAKER_19", "text": "I'm not here to talk about European history tonight. All of my ancestors in Poland were murdered by Hitler. That's a fact. I can't find any of them. And in my mind, Israel is exactly the same as Nazi Germany. Exactly the same.  And they prove it every day. Even down to the level even down to the level of training. American police forces for example, the top brass of the Memphis Police Department got training in Israel for God's sake.  The new and you see you see that now Tyree Nichols is dead beaten to death by Memphis police. I'm not ready to Pat the Memphis police on the back.  By the way, while your tax dollars turbocharged the Israeli military, Israel is shooting and bombing its way across occupied Palestine, leaving behind a pile of dead Palestinian bodies, which you are responsible for. You have been blocking the resolution against military aid to Israel for years. Racist dogs that you are.  While a guy named Ben Gavir is now Israel's racist national security minister, he appeared, he appeared in a political cartoon, which landed in council member Jen Iyer's hands last meeting. That cartoon showed Iyer sporting a dog collar, riding with Biden and Ben Gavir. And when you consider  how much money she got from old friends of the Israel Defense Forces for her campaign, that cartoon was not too far off, was it? How dare you take money for your campaign from old friends of the Israel Defense Forces while the IDF murders Palestinians? Council Member Iyer, how dare you?  Only a racist goddamn dog would do something like that, in my opinion. And of course, Ayer went crazy when she saw that cartoon. She tore it up. She went batshit crazy. She threw the pieces all over the carpet, proving herself to be really, in my opinion, an incontinent dog for the apartheid state of Israel, coming soon to a carpet near you.

I've owned my historic house at 524 North Division Street for 40 years. I lived there for 12 years with my family and have plans to return there. My house shares a south property line with 530 North Division Street. I'm opposed and protest the PUD. R4C zoning limits multifamily housing  to three units. Both properties, 530, 524, are zoned R4C. However, the only plan Mr. Selby submitted was a non-zone compliant four units, one more unit than R4C allows. When that failed to make it through the planning department, he applied in 2022 for a PUD with the stated purpose of removing the existing 300  3,333 square feet building, replacing it with an 8,000 square foot four-unit building. This timeline shows an attempt to usurp R4C rights of others. It's not allowed under the Unified Development Code. I think Mr. Selby was wasting the planning department's time, council's time, my time, my attorney's time, and will waste court time.  I see the 5.30 proposal as greed camouflaged by green. The property owner to the north is an attorney. He gets three feet of setback. I'm not an attorney, nor is my husband. We get none. Our seasonal storage bin that I've used for 40 years will be taken away. I am now made to share a driveway. I have no place to put the snow.  The perennials lining the driveway are going to be taken away. Our daughter helped plant those when she was six. If Mr. Selby had approached the project correctly the first time, we would not be here tonight. And if an 8,000 square foot building can prove net zero, then a building half the size with the same solar footprint can also be net zero without a zoning change. I request you, Mr. Taylor,  to approach Mr. Selby and request that he produce a building plan that fits R4C and ask Mr. Selby to stop wasting our time. Please stop the PUD. Thank you all."}, {"start": 2783, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "text": "Good evening. My name is Chris Crogut. I'm president of the Old Fourth Ward Association, where this project is sitting, will sit.  Over the past few years, Doug Selby has met with the executive committee of the Old Fourth Ward Association many times.  to outline his plans, which ultimately culminated in a PUD. He gave us endless reasons why the current building is not sustainable, that it's barely holding together, probably just because it's used to holding together.  and how something that is larger in scale could benefit both the neighborhood in terms of attractiveness and also add to more units of housing in the neighborhood.  Preservationists don't take kindly very often to these kinds of proposals, but we had many respectful discussions with Doug Selby, and we came to realize that his plan was a good one, a sound one. We all live in historic houses, and we love our historic houses and all the history of our community that they embody.  These two houses present an unusual case for us because they were two buildings that were just kind of band-aided together at some point in time. They were never a single house. And Doug Selby did extensive research to come to the conclusion that this would be probably the best solution in terms of making this particular building usable into the 21st century.  For that reason we supported the project before the Historic District Commission We also supported the project When it went to the Planning Commission and we support the project here before City Council  We've not always been happy about PUDs. We vigorously opposed what has ended up now as a hotel in the historic district on Glen Street. We were adamantly opposed to that. It wasn't housing. It's a vanity project. But this is housing, and we need housing in our neighborhood. And we think that this is a good project, and we support it."}, {"start": 2945, "speaker": "SPEAKER_05", "text": "I'm Jeff communications officer the 4th Ward Association and I'm here to speak in favor of this project. Doug has taken all the right steps. He has met with us numerous times.  received our feedback, incorporated that feedback, gone to the historic commission and got approval for that. I would like to point out that this project is one of a number of projects where we have approved increased density in the area. There's the Garnett. There is a fascinating project coming up in a couple weeks at 511 Anne that you're going to see. And it took a house that was nearly destroyed  and is putting an addition on the back in a sensitive way. And the reason why we're in favor of it, it doesn't disturb the front view. It's the addition goes on the back, but it maintains the historic integrity of the front and the neighborhood.  There's a house in Detroit Street we were in favor of. But we like the creativity and we like the fact that he's connected with us, so we are speaking in favor of this project. Thank you."}, {"start": 3028, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "text": "Hi, I'm Doug Salby. I just wanted to say a couple words about this project, which we're calling The Bridge. From its inception, we wanted this project to be an example. We wanted it to be carbon neutral in operation, which is actually pretty tricky on such a small site.  Buildings also produce a lot of carbon in construction, though, so to a pretty great extent, we're deconstructing the building and reusing as many of the elements as we can. Also, we have a pretty extensive curated list almost entirely of recycled, non-toxic, or sustainably manufactured products. All of them are non-toxic. Can't really go through all the green features here tonight, or we'd be here for a few hours, but what I can say is that this project is a pretty impressive piece of engineering.  and it's legitimately one of the world's most sustainable buildings. We designed it to fit into the streetscape and scale, and design, make a nice piece of architecture. I appreciate the strong support of the Old Fourth Ward Association, and I appreciate the ideas that they came up with to make it better. We also want it to be an educational tour with tours and seminars on site, and videos that explain these advanced technologies, not just how they work, but also how they're installed.  We'll be working with the Skill Bridge Program, which retrains exiting armed forces member in construction, in the construction industry. We hope to work with the Ann Arbor Student Builder Program. These are high school kids who build houses as part of their curriculum. We desperately need this next generation of construction workers to be up to speed on this type of emerging construction technology.  And we want this to be a place for hands-on learning. Passive buildings can offer a better long-term return on investment for developers, and we want that to be out there so that people will be incentivized to do this more. We also wanted it to be repeatable and hopefully scalable so that more people will build deep energy buildings. I know this is just a tiny drop in the bucket, but it doesn't really amount to much unless we can use it as a springboard to make this type of construction much more commonplace.  It's hard to talk about our climate emergency as a scientist without sounding hysterical, but gosh darn it, I just feel like we need to start following our intent with meaningful actions. Buildings are a huge part of the problem, and we need to be incentivizing people to retrofit and rebuild all electric buildings that can become carbon neutral.  I know you can't make everybody happy all the time, but I'm sure you guys know that better than most, as well as the city staff. But I do see that we need to move forward in a way that creatively tackles these problems if we're going to tackle the biggest crisis that humankind has ever seen. So time for business as usual, just in my opinion, just has to be over. Thank you."}], "public_hearings_4": [], "public_hearings_5": [{"start": 3364, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "text": "Hi again. I just wanted to address another topic tonight, which is affordability. I'm a member of Equitable Ann Arbor, which has as a core value that if you work in Ann Arbor, you should be able to live in Ann Arbor.  These apartments are a market rate. I can't make them affordable and cover the cost of construction. And since starting and titling this project over five years ago, the cost of what it will take to make me be able to break even on this has risen about $600 per bedroom. It's a lot.  It kind of keeps me up at night, but the alternative is to keep throwing good money after bad with a building that is just pretty badly compromised. I think this council understands more than most that in order to keep our city vibrant and dynamic, that means we need a lot more housing, especially if we want to be inclusive with our housing. And if sustainability and affordability are problems the city wants to tackle, we have to address one of the root causes.  One of them is that it's way too difficult and costly to build in Ann Arbor. Outcomes can be very unpredictable. Ultimately, taxpayers pay for that, and it makes our city less affordable and less possible to meet our city's challenges and population growth.  And it also freezes out small local developers. High cost and unpredictability of entitlement can make it too risky. So I know it's really easy to complain about government and bureaucracies and things like that, but there is a lot of stuff the city could do to make this work better.  Just one small example is using the PUD designation to cut through a lot of the red tape and offer people an incentive if they will come up with exemplary projects that the city is looking for. Also, I think it would be a strong incentive for developers, and the city would get better developments faster, and you'd probably foster more trust between the city and the building and development community.  Post-pandemic, a lot of organizations are sort of reassessing their policies to see what's relevant still and what's a relic. And I am heartened to see that the city seems to be having these conversations now. We do have a long way to go, though. And I think we all have to change and adapt to the way we've historically done things if we want to meet this enormous challenge. And certainly, I can tell you the building industry is no exception to that.  So, but I want to leave this one thought is that I would say that a carrot is always a more powerful than the stick if we're bringing about long-lasting positive change. And I urge you to use this opportunity and time to work with us to create more win-win situations."}]}
