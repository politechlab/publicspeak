{"public_comments_1": [{"start": 593.749, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "text": "Hello, thank you. Good evening. Casey Klein, 3304 North Timberwood Drive, Traverse City, Michigan 49686. I would like to address agenda item C1 regarding the proposed new development at 530 North Division Street, which would include the removal of the 3,000 square foot structure to be replaced with an 8,000 square foot recertified structure.  I grew up next door at 524 North Division Street, where my family continues to be stewards of this historic property today. One of the responsibilities of the city is to set and maintain standards, and this project falls well outside the current standards. When a variance is allowed, it sets a precedent. If the city's intent is to start changing this neighborhood, then those changes should be a part of a larger master plan and approved by the citizen.  not piecemeal together as will happen if this proposal moves forward without substantial modifications. During the Planning Commission meeting, I heard one of the commissioners ask about adding a maximum setback  and another about adding restrictions for maximum height. That only added to my concern that there is no clear or set plan moving forward in this neighborhood. I believe the proposed construction should be at a minimum contained to the existing footprint, if not in total size, scale, and historical exterior finishes, in order to maintain the characteristics of this unique neighborhood.  The only thing to be gained by building a structure as large as what is proposed is to make money, and that is not the city's responsibility to ensure that that happens. New construction within the existing footprint would be a win-win in my eyes, as it would maintain the current look and feel of the neighborhood, could still achieve the goals of LEED certification, and be designed for more dense occupancy. Even when a project checks all the boxes,  It does not always mean it is the right thing to do. The Old Fourth Ward was not developed at an energy-saving district, but a historical one, and future planning for this area should take that into consideration. During a previous Planning Commission meeting, I heard Mr. Shelby acknowledge the history of the neighborhood and noted no Native American presence in this area. If the proposal moves forward without substantial modification to the footprint, please consider requiring an archeological survey of the site prior to development.  This neighborhood is one area close to downtown that is protected from university development. Every time I pass the corner where the Flimsy Burger location used to be, my heart sinks a little. I miss the quaint gateways downtown. The looming building that replaced this structure, which contributed to that faint feeling, does not fit the site and look out of place. While it is beautifully designed, it does not fit the site or characteristics adjacent to it.  While that structure is much larger than what's proposed by 30 Division Street, it gives an example of the way that one structure can change the entire look and feel of an area. Thank you for your time and consideration."}, {"start": 794.651, "speaker": "SPEAKER_03", "text": "I'm Ed Mahoney, 1413 Chaffer Road, Ann Arbor, Michigan. For 40 years, I've owned the property adjacent to and south of the 530 development. I lived at the property for eight years and started my family there and would like to return to live there sometime. I ask that the PUD not be granted.  I think it is clear that if an 8,000 square foot house can be net zero, then a 4,000 square house with the same solar footprint will also be net zero and meet the city's energy and density goals. Mr. Shelby claims to be a builder, carpenter, and landlord and has owned for 45 years.  for 20 years, the 3,333 square foot building at 530 North Division Street. I think Mr. Shelby describes the building as collapsing. It appears that the structure will end up in the landfill. I don't think the city should award a landlord that fails to maintain his building with a PUD.  Also, what are the consequences if energy predictions don't materialize? Will the city triple his property taxes? Will he be made to remove one of the units for the structure in compliance then with RC4 zoning? Or will he just pass the extra energy cost on to tenants and laugh all the way to the bank with his  140% increase in profit. I am unaware that private businesses under any obligation to share accurate energy information with the city or anyone.  Private businesses, to my knowledge, are not under the Freedom of Information Act. Likewise, I do not think he's under any obligation to install any energy savings equipment in the building. And if it is not available or is too expensive at the time of construction, or keep it maintained once installed, he can just pass the high energy costs on to the tenants.  I bought into RC4 zoning 40 years ago and I do not want those rights stolen from me when this new building, this new house is built. I ask that you deny the PUD. Thank you."}, {"start": 951.95, "speaker": "SPEAKER_10", "text": "Good evening, Council. Dan Adams, 1016 Daniel Street. I'm here to talk about the library lot. Four years ago, a small group of anti-development activists called Library Green successfully amended the city's charter to preserve a downtown parking lot forever as a park. They promised the public that they would do this privately. It would be a project privately led, privately funded, and that it would be completed by the city's bicentennial.  The city has given Library Green a fair and full opportunity to deliver on what it said it was going to do. Four years to raise money, privileged access to council and staff, a city-funded task force, a dedicated advisory commission that exists entirely separate from the Parks Department, and critically, hundreds of thousands of dollars in city budget allocations. Few citizen-led,  Projects enjoy this kind of city support, and few organizations could have wasted that support more comprehensively. They haven't raised the money. They don't have a plan to do it. They haven't demonstrated to voters that they are capable of executing their vision or making any significant progress on that vision on any reasonable time scale, short-term, medium-term, long-term. The politics of housing and land use in Ann Arbor since the passage of Proposal A have shifted dramatically.  In the last two cycles, we've seen voters comprehensively reject the exclusionary anti-housing agenda that animated Proposal A's passage. Every council member who supported significant resource diversion to the project has lost their seat. Every year that goes by, under the status quo, they will continue to parasitically drain and waste staff time and resources,  They will cause the city and private organizations like Peter Allen's EA2, who's sitting behind me, they'll have to plan around this fiction. And the city, critically, is going to continue to lose millions of dollars in tax revenue, hundreds of units of housing, tens of millions of dollars in grants. Tomorrow I'm going to email all of you a draft resolution. It doesn't repeal Proposal A. It replaces it.  with a charter codified commitment to invest whatever we reap from the sale of that property to advance community consensus policy goals, to help the city. It also requires any purchaser that would come along to create and maintain the plaza that we were promised, the plaza that we would have today, absent the intervention of Library Green.  I'm speaking you tonight because I'm independently passionate about this issue. I was a taxpayer. I was a resident. I was not involved in city politics. This is something that really drew me in because of how indefensible and shocking it was. I believe it's time to ask voters this year, 2023, whether they want to continue throwing good money after bad. Thank you."}, {"start": 1165.526, "speaker": "SPEAKER_08", "text": "Hi, good evening. Adam Goodman joining from Ward 5.  So this past Friday, the Ann Arbor Fire Department reported in a social media post that a pedestrian was struck on Jackson Avenue in front of Veterans Park and had been in critical condition after that. So I haven't seen, I don't think we have a full accounting of exactly what happened just yet, but I've been dreading this sort of situation for some time.  In fact, I spoke to council about pedestrian safety on Jackson Avenue back in September, and I said it was inevitable that somebody would be hurt or worse. I hate that I was apparently correct about this. I hate it. But here we are. So this location, Jackson, with Betts Park on one side and Burwood Avenue on the other, it's a high demand spot for pedestrian crossing across Jackson Avenue.  It connects a neighborhood to one of our city's premier parks, but there's no marked crosswalk no safe way to cross the street there. In fact, this is part of a stretch of Jackson Avenue over two thirds of a mile long without a single marked crosswalk without a single safe place to cross, even though there are bus stops all along here neighborhoods, there's convenience stores and of course there's parks so  You know, folks in the neighborhood along Jackson, and city staff too, to their credit, have actually been working for years to try to get some mid-block crosswalks added here, at least ever since the road diet was completed in 2015 on Jackson, if not for a lot longer before then. But so far, nothing's happened, because this is a state trumpline owned by the Michigan Department of Transportation, and MDOT just doesn't seem to care about anything except free-flowing car traffic, at least not until people die.  Adding a few crosswalks is the least they could do to improve pedestrian safety and access in this city, but they haven't done it for at least eight years now when people have been asking them for it. Now, I know this sort of situation is why the city is running a study looking at possibly taking control over these state routes. But the outcome of that study isn't a foregone conclusion, and it really won't come soon enough in any case. We need MDOT to add safe crossings on Jackson and West Huron  Now, immediately, as we have just seen, every moment of delay puts our neighbors and our community at further risk. You know, enough is enough.  So tonight, I'm speaking to you. I'm in a slightly weird position where I'm asking city council to take action on a problem, even though I know that you don't really have authority over it. Sorry about that. But still, I hope you will do everything you can to convince MDOT to finally solve this problem and to do so without delay. And I will also do what I can to contact them directly. And I hope everyone in the community who's watching this who cares about this issue will do the same. Thank you."}, {"start": 1357.759, "speaker": "SPEAKER_09", "text": "You've started the clock. I haven't started talking yet. Thank you. Chris, Aisha, Cynthia, Dharma, Jen, Lisa, Lynn, Travis, Erica, Jen, the Ann Arbor City Council,  Look at that Human Rights Commission document in front of you. You all got a copy today. It's the Human Rights Commission of Ann Arbor in 2003 telling you, the city council, to pass a resolution against military aid to Israel. Look at it. Allow a vote on the resolution.  We are against military aid to Israel. We didn't make it up. We got it from the Human Rights Commission. Vote for it. You, the City Council, up until now, up until now, have broadcast to the world that Palestinians' lives are worth nothing to you while you pretend to be progressive.  You, the City Council, have let the world know that Palestinians have no rights that you are bound to respect. But the whole progressive base of your party, the whole progressive base of your party, has already moved decisively over to supporting Palestinian human rights. Don't you know that?  We are no longer in 1857 when the Supreme Court ruled that black people have no rights which the white man is bound to respect. Similarly, we are no longer in a time when you can call yourself a progressive and say that Palestinians have no rights that you are bound to respect.  while you pour billions of dollars of military aid into the apartheid state of Israel. Don't even pretend you're progressive unless you say something about that. Beware of hitching your wagon to the violent, racist state of Israel. Israel, who you remember,  is a hardcore supporter for many years of apartheid South Africa. Even if you, like Iyer, took campaign money from old friends of the Israel Defense Forces, even if you did, you really ought to allow a vote on the seven-word resolution that's been in front of you for so long  Ready? Quote, we are against military aid to Israel. Unquote. Allow a vote and vote for it."}], "public_comments_2": [{"start": 1749.64, "speaker": "SPEAKER_07", "text": "I'm Peter Allen, a resident of the Newport West Condominiums for about 50 years. I came to U of M School in 1971 to take seven really valuable courses in business, architecture, urban planning graduate programs. My favorite course was with Norbert Gorwick in urban planning. At every class, he would show us his personal travel pictures of the great cities of the world.  Professor Growick made a huge difference on me, so much so that I stayed in Ann Arbor to pursue my real estate career and raise my family, having fallen in love with its walkable urbanity, nearby parks, and the amazing Huron River. I started teaching real estate development at the University in 1980 as a side pursuit to my development. I retired last winter from teaching over 40 years and 4,000 students, including Jeff Gahan, Lisa Suave, Wanwu Li, Hilary Hansel to name just a few of those at City Hall.  One of my best and last students, Sarah Lorenz, and I co-founded a non-profit, Equitable Ann Arbor Land Trust in 2019 to offer creative and bold housing solutions due to Ann Arbor's lack of housing at all the middle and lower price points. Here are EA2's recommendations. First, step for step, expand park land uses and activities near the riverfront.  expand the new 22 million dollar funded Lowertown Riverfront Conservancy to help with new passive active cultural recreational  and educational opportunities. Open the river views by culling all the invasives. Expand the bike and walking trails out into the nearby neighborhoods along the creek sheds. Enhance and transform the 2.5 mile stretch of river into the defining characteristic of Ann Arbor, as renowned as the big house is to the university. Use the river to stitch together the town and gown. Make this new riverfront a birthday present to our citizens for the next 200 years.  Step two, motivate the city and university to transform their well-located service parking lots into mixed-use housing over retail. Place these public sites into community land trusts with 99-year leases. Develop them with affordable workforce and market rate housing for sale rather than rental wherever possible.  Local retail and new parking would be added where necessary. The eight large parking lots for the housing solution are all located within the five oxbows from Argo Pond to the Arboretum. Can you imagine where any of them are? Two sites are owned by the city. The rest are mostly owned by the university.  Tonight, I'd like to introduce six talented U of M seniors and their faculty advisor, Christina Eckhoff. Stand up, folks. They will all be doing their three-credit capstone class this term to help the EA2 unravel the details and complexities for our agenda. This capstone team will be researching best practices across the country on how to promote Ann Arbor's riverfront renaissance.  This will be for a fully explained article by Ryan Stanton later on this week. Thank you very much. I've got a handout for each of you as well. Appreciate it.

I also want to mention some revisions to language in the A2 snow match program. I talked to Mr. Fournier today and currently language states that one must have a physical disability in order to qualify for the program. City staff is going to work on revising that to say physical, mental or otherwise disability. So we're not functioning with any kind of hierarchy of disability.  Um, and then I have finally a quick update from the Human Rights Commission, which is I'm happy to share that the commission will be bringing forth an ordinance amending the city's non discrimination ordinance. Um, so it would effectively ban discrimination against government issued ideas.  This is an issue that affects thousands of people from accessing resources, food, housing, and it would open up those resources to many.

I hope you've had a chance to look at the material in your packet that we sent you, the statement we sent you. I'll touch on a few items in that. We think that the maps that were taken out of that plan, taken out of the 2016 plan, in the current plan, need to be either reinstated in the plan or carried forward in some fashion.  Because they show what exists in terms of the Huron River Greenway, the border-to-border trail links, what exists, what needs to be filled, what gaps need to be filled. These have been longstanding plans, and the maps help clarify that. One picture is worth 1,000 words, we think, on conveying the concept.  Having the maps in there will help with funding applications, I think. One example of the things that are needed are in the vicinity of the Fuller Maiden Lane intersection, where we have a mess right now, long planned trail systems. The bridges in that area were built with pads underneath, concrete pads to link the trails. And the border board trail is supposed to go under one of those. Those haven't been built in the last 40 years since the bridges were rebuilt back in the 1980s. This needs to be moved forward.  This concept was also in the 2006 non-motorized transportation plan, and city council reinforced the concept back in 2015 resolution.  The Greenway system, the park system in the valley, is really a jewel of Ann Arbor's park system, and many minds have gone into creating that concept. Now, you may have seen in our material that there's a timing problem, because the parks department needs to submit an approved plan to DNR in order to be able to submit grant proposals. So unless you can figure out a way around this, there may not be time to get the maps into the plan right now.  You may have no choice but to adopt the plan as is, but we think that it's important for the city council to adopt those maps as ongoing city policy until there's time to incorporate them, either amend them into the plan or create a new plan. And also to direct the park staff to any future amendment to the plan or future plans to incorporate those maps.  Just a comment as an individual. There's this issue of what's transportation, what's recreation, how to get the departments working together. Because there's really, this crosses both boundaries. And we need to figure out how to.  get people working together to implement these things. Having those maps out of the plan makes it difficult for us to see where we're going. We need a vision of where we're going, make it easy for people to see, and then figure out how to get departments playing together, together with outside funding agencies, to make these important projects happen. Happy to answer any questions, and I hope you have a chance to look at the material that we sent you, if you haven't.

Can everyone see that fully?  All right, so the PROS plan, just a brief overview of what this is. This is our comprehensive plan for the park system with a look five years ahead and also longer range. So one of the reasons we update this regularly is that the Michigan Department of Natural Resources requires us to file a PROS plan or REC plan with them every five years in order to maintain eligibility for their grant funding.  But it's also a great opportunity for us to ensure that this still reflects public values and desires of the community. So it provides this forum for public input through a variety of ways. It also outlines needs and desires for existing and future facilities.  And so just to give you an overview of the level of community engagement that this plan has undertaken, we started with an online survey last spring where we had over nearly 2,400 respondents. So this was, I think, nearly double what the previous PROSE plan was. So we were really excited about that. There was a task force guiding the survey rollout as well as the survey development.  and a lot of thought was put into how we could reach a broader audience. In addition to the online survey, we met with several focus groups, Park Advisory Commission, Recreation Advisory Commission, Planning Commission, as well as the Office of Sustainability, and two focus groups on relevant issues. So one focused on downtown parks, and then another one focused on bike recreation.  In addition to that, we held two separate public meetings, one virtual, one in person. And of course, we've received several email comments throughout this process. We also, by law, are required to have a 42-day open review period, which took place this November into December 23rd.  And so with this public comment period, we actually shared a preliminary draft of the PROS plan with PAC and Planning Commission back in October. We had a draft plan that was posted on the park planning website back on October 13th that was available for public review. On November 11th, City Council approved the formal distribution of the PROS plan.  and began this formal 42-day public comment period that ended near the end of the year. But there was a long time where we had opportunities for the community to weigh in on this and several opportunities basically throughout the past year.  And so here we are today. This is kind of the final step in getting our approvals before we can submit to the DNR by the end of January. So we had a special meeting with the Park Advisory Commission on the 3rd. They recommended it for adoption. We had a Planning Commission public hearing on January 4th, who has also recommended it for City Council adoption. So here we are today with you.  And some of the themes of the public comments that we've been hearing, a lot centered around center of the city. I know we had a public comment earlier. We received a statement from the Council of the Commons, as well as from individual comments from members of the community. A lot of discussion around including census data breakdown by different planning areas of the city, having the document show strong support.  and also clarifying funding responsibility of the Council of the Commons or Park Advisory Commission or Parks Department.  We had several requests for dark skies compliant lighting practices to be included, requests for new amenities improvements. Some of these were for specific parks, others were from neighborhood associations or other informal groups. And then other miscellaneous public input we had around these Huron River Greenway plans you had mentioned earlier, the existing railroad barriers throughout the city and how those affect non-motorized transportation.  as well as sustainability. At the January 3rd Park Advisory Commission meeting, the plan was recommended for approval, but with a few language adjustments. We consolidated discussion around the center of the city from being in two locations in the plan to just one location on page 52. We expanded a description of the center of the city to include the specific charter language,  That's also included on page 52. And then we made an adjustment to the sentence you see below to clarify that the Council of the Commons is responsible for recommendations on design, usage, and funding for the library lane lot portion of the center of the city, while Liberty Plaza and the Kemp House remain under the jurisdiction of the Ann Arbor Parks and Recreation. So that was something that came out of PAC on the 3rd.  And so with that, we just wanted to give an overview of kind of how we got to this point, but happy to take any questions any of you may have. Thank you."}, {"start": 4280.705, "speaker": "SPEAKER_14", "text": "I don't have any questions. I just want to remark that I'm appreciative of how much thought and public input went into this plan. I think some things really bubbled up in terms of priorities for the community, in terms of improving our existing facilities and making sure that our parks as they are are activated.  And with especially with an eye towards inclusivity I think that one of the things that stood out to me was the public desire for more restrooms downtown And I realized that that would be something that is a thoughtful consideration by the council in terms of both the maintenance creation and the money involved and  with creating those facilities that are much needed and obviously based on public comment desired. As a parent, I couldn't agree strongly with the sentiment that came out of the public comment period and survey period around existing and improving our playgrounds. There's definitely playgrounds in our town that are great and some that are lacking, and to bring them all up to a standard  have a difficult choice as to what playground to go to as a parent would be a really good problem to have. And I'm incredibly interested in the feedback that came back regarding the border to border trail and making sure that we have connectivity so that trails don't just end and we're dumped out into a street where we have to continue our commute to the next connection point. I think that that's something across the county where Ann Arbor can play a really strong and leadership role.  and making sure that we have some attention to that. So those are the things that really stood out for me. And again, I appreciate the public who commented and participated in all the various listening sessions and surveys and to the park staff and parks commission that put so much thoughtful detail into this."}]}
