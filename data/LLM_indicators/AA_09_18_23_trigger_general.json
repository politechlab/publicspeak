No Mayor.  Thank you. We do have one introduction today that is a proclamation to celebrate September 2023 as Recovery Month. Mr. Stabenow, would you join me up? Well,  One of the things that sets Ann Arbor apart, one of the things that we appreciate and that give me such great pride with respect to Ann Arbor is our community values. Indeed, Ann Arbor truly is for everyone. And that is foundational to who we are. It's foundational to how we organize ourselves as a community. And one of the  constituent parts of our community is the members of the Ann Arbor community who are in recovery. And I am just so proud that Ann Arbor is a place that is recovery friendly, where the community members who are in recovery are welcomed and supported at each and every location within Ann Arbor.  They're ordinary folks living their day-to-day lives with extraordinary strength. And it is something that is incredibly, incredibly admirable. And I'm just so proud that the way that we work to integrate, we do integrate members of our recovery community in Ann Arbor. And so I'm delighted to read this proclamation in small part to express that. Proclamation celebrating September 2023 as Recovery Month.  Whereas September is National Recovery Month, and whereas addiction is a major national public health issue affecting those who suffer, their families, loved ones, and their communities. Whereas recovery is a reality for millions of resilient Americans whose life has been transformed, and as a result, so too have their families and their communities. Whereas recovery from addiction flourishes in supportive, recovery-friendly communities.  Whereas Ann Arbor is such a recovery-friendly community, home to a vibrant, diverse, and thriving recovery community, a model recovery-oriented system of care, recovery-friendly employers, collegiate recovery programs, and many recovery allies and dedicated professionals who help people initiate and maintain their recoveries.  And whereas proclaiming September 2023 as Recovery Month serves to applaud those who are in recovery, their families, loved ones, and the community that supports them, providing hope to those who still suffer and affirming our shared belief in redemption and second chances. Now, therefore, I, Christopher Taylor, Mayor of Ann Arbor, Michigan, do hereby proclaim the month of September 2023 as Recovery Month and invite residents of Ann Arbor to support those in recovery and the programs and services designed to help those in need.  Thank you. All right."}, {"start": 431.442, "end": 623.249, "speaker": "SPEAKER_08", "text": "Hello, everyone. Thank you, Mayor and Council, for once again recognizing September as Recovery Month. My name is Matt Statman, and I've told my story here before, but I'm going to do it again. I grew up here in Ann Arbor. I developed a substance use disorder in Ann Arbor, and I broke the law in Ann Arbor. I went to jail in Ann Arbor. I went to prison as a result of things I did in Ann Arbor.  I also got publicly funded long-term treatment in Ann Arbor. I had access to entry-level jobs and affordable, supportive, structured housing that did not discriminate against me based on my legal history. And I've now been in abstinence-based recovery in Ann Arbor since 2002.  And in that time, I've attended Washtenaw Community College, Eastern Michigan University, and the University of Michigan. I now work at the University of Michigan managing the collegiate recovery program. I also teach in the School of Social Work at Eastern Michigan University, and I do work with the local courts to help people get adequate care for their substance use issues rather than punishment.  And my story is not unique. Ann Arbor is home to a diverse and strong recovery community. We are everywhere. It's likely that you interact with people in recovery all the time and you may not know it. Ann Arbor is a great place to be in recovery and we also have work to do. And I'm going to tell a story. The other day I was  doing an assessment of a guy who was court-involved and needed treatment, and we were talking about his history, and I asked him about his substance use, and he said, man, I'm from Ann Arbor. Like, I get high. And it was almost as if substance use was synonymous with growing up in Ann Arbor, and  Recovery should also be a place that is synonymous with growing up in Ann Arbor if you have a substance use issue. So we have work to do. Affordable housing, especially recovery safe affordable housing, is a barrier for people in early recovery living near their workplaces or finding homes in places with access to the social determinants of recovery.  Access to adequate treatment is still not equitable and certain populations have easier access to good care. The legal system still needs a lot of work and people with history of addiction still face discrimination in many workplaces. We've done a lot to address these issues. Ann Arbor has a Recovery is Good business initiative where local businesses hire people in recovery intentionally. And we have  work to do, as I said. So in order to make Ann Arbor, continue to make Ann Arbor an increasingly recovery-friendly community, we should continue to focus on these things and we need to celebrate the work we've done and the hundreds, if not thousands of people in recovery and their families in our community. So thanks again for recognizing this and I'm gonna turn it over to my friend John here."}, {"start": 629.584, "end": 874.522, "speaker": "SPEAKER_22", "text": "Hi, my name is John. I'm a person in recovery. Going all the way back to just the story, there's too many stories to tell. I was young, full of angst. Around 10 or 11 years old, I began to recognize that I needed to change how I felt.  Fast forward to that, drugs and alcohol became something that I used in my life to change how I felt. And it worked for a little while until it doesn't work anymore. And then before you know it, I was overwhelmed in a culture of addiction, partying, and hanging out with the wrong environment.  Fast forward, there's a lot of consequences, a lot of missteps. And before you know it, you're 35, 40 years old, out of touch, and in denial.  I had to figure out, or what they would call radically, accept that I wasn't going to be able to change on my own. I needed help from other people. And so I went to programs that told me that I needed other people. I went to these programs, and I got a sponsor. And my sponsor said, go to meetings and shut up.  and just listen to what other people have to tell you. Find out what they did. So 15 years ago, I began  that journey, and today I can say that, you know, I have, I'm experiencing the best life I could imagine. I have a couple degrees. I met Matt at the Collegiate Recovery Program up at Michigan. I consider him a great friend. And I landed at Dawn Farms, which I'm currently the coordinator of outpatient services.  So along with my story, there's also a lot of people that have the same experience as I, that I work with on a daily basis. And I have a staff that works hard with people that are trying to make a decision to radically accept that they need help from others. This is very important.  It is very important for people to know that you can recover from substance abuse, opioid addiction. I learned a long time ago, was told a long time ago that I probably wouldn't have a chance to recover. People that use opiates or heroin, they don't recover. And that's not true. We just need the right guidance and the right help.  As soon as I got here in Ann Arbor for grad school, there was some anxiety around coming to a big university like this. And I told them what I needed.  They told me about the collegiate recovery program. I got into the master's program I met Matt and a lot of other people that have the same journey and here I am Ann Arbor is a great place to be a great place to recover and But we got a lot of work to do Thank you"}, {"start": 896.738, "end": 927.53, "speaker": "SPEAKER_15", "text": "We now come to Public Comment Reserve Time.

I represent two creative companies, Treetown Murals and Brush Monkeys. We have been serving Washtenaw County and the southeastern Michigan for over 20 years, bringing public art and window art to different neighborhoods and cities. Today I'm here to talk about consent agenda number six for all of you. It's the murals that bridge project.  We are identifying two major gateways to our community, one being the Huron underpass over here and then North Main Street. North Main Street is actually where I got my start as a public artist. The painting there still exists. It's very much in need of repair. But we've used this foothold to bring this new project to the residents and visitors of Ann Arbor.  This project is not only going to restore the wing walls, but also the fascia beam. So this is the first time actually the metal overpass that goes over the roads will be identified for public art. And because of that, we need a right-of-way permit. We will be closing the lanes one at a time in order to access the fascia beam.  We have hired Northstar Painting to do the restoration of the overpass. And it wasn't until recently that MDOT told us that Treetown Murals, Watco, and Northstar are actually not eligible to file the road permit.  So we have had to lean on the city of Ann Arbor to represent this project for us. And thank you to those who have already cooperated immensely on city staff to get us even on this agenda today. This project was slated to start in July and here we are in September. So it goes without saying that we're kind of moving this as fast as possible, hopefully at least getting the restoration done and maybe the wing walls painted and hopefully the whole project before the end of 2023.  free.  Now this is a twofold project. So tying into the bicentennial of next year, we hope to do the restoration and new murals on the North Main. And again, creating welcoming messaging to people coming into our community is kind of the big overhaul here. So today with consent agenda number six, we're looking for approval from the city to kind of go through with this project that the city would file the row on our behalf.  And that we could just kind of get going with the MDOT approvals now. I also serve as a public art commissioner Here in Ann Arbor and we've never had to deal with this aesthetic enhancement criteria that MDOT is putting for us But it's also just a great kind of learning curve for future public art projects So this is probably not the first time you will see this on your agenda given that 2024 we want to do this again so we are looking to  have the city support us and moving forward with this project.

This is absolutely fantastic.  But I'd love to see some city funding going to improving the park and its non-car connectivity too. Many people come to that park from the other side of I-94, meaning they either have to take the pedestrian bridge from Mary Beth Doyle Park and then walk along Ellsworth, or they have to use the Platt Road Bridge, which has five lanes of speeding traffic on it, narrow, unbuffeted, and unprotected bike lanes, and narrow sidewalks.  Even just a lane re-striping to remove the turning lane from the bridge itself and provide buffers for the bike lanes would improve it tremendously, and there is even more improvement that I'm sure our engineers could come up with at the same time. I'd also like to continue pointing out that as a city, we're still underperforming on our goals.  Our progress on an all-ages and abilities bike network has been poor. Fully a quarter of our total planned sidewalks in the city remain unbuilt, and at our current pace it will take us another century to build them. We continue to wait for years for traffic calming projects, with the petitions for both CA4 and CA5 having been submitted all the way back in 2020.  We continue to have empty lots where it's not even legal to build a duplex because of outdated zoning laws and setbacks. And we continue to allow new construction with even more space dedicated to cars than to human beings. We continue to subsidize parking with underpriced or free government-funded parking provided all over streets all across town.  All of this contributes to automobile emissions, which are one of the largest forms of greenhouse gas emissions, not just in the city where it's even larger than the portions set aside nationwide, but in fact in the country and the world. If we're going to be serious about climate, if we're going to be serious about safety, we really need to focus  on getting our transportation.

I'm almost certain that among the members of council and me, I'm the only one who actually knew Kathy and witnessed the political events that took place at that time. As far as I know, there are no statues of any person in public view anywhere in the city of Ann Arbor. This is not a good time to start and this is not the right person to start with.  Kathy is to be honored for being the first openly gay or lesbian candidate to be elected to public office in this country. Note, Kathy wasn't the first person to be out while in office. That distinction is believed to belong to two members of this council who preceded her, Jerry DeGreek and Nancy Wexler, who came out while on council. She also wasn't the first openly gay or lesbian candidate for public office. That distinction probably belongs to the legendary San Francisco gay activist Harvey Milk.  Milk was elected to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in 1977. He was assassinated by a conservative member of that body within a year of his election.  Milk had run also as an openly gay man in 1973, before Cathy ran, but lost. He had the disadvantage of having to run and win citywide, while Cathy had only to prevail in the predominantly student and decidedly gay-friendly Second Ward, which is already represented by Nancy Wexler.  The resolution describes Kathy as a beacon of courage, but she disagrees. She said, I don't think I was brave because I was in a college town and it was cool to be who I was.  Nancy Wexler agrees. She said, in Ann Arbor in 1974, we had pretty much gotten everything we wanted for gay people by then. There wasn't really a debate over gay rights in her ward. So what were Cathy's contributions to the city of Ann Arbor besides this historical footnote? The resolution doesn't cite anything else that Cathy did except that she was an activist student at the University of Michigan. That covers many tens of thousands of people.  There are many other Ann Arborites who actually made major and lasting contributions to the life and history of the city who would be more deserving of such an honor. But in its 200th year as a city, Ann Arbor doesn't really need to start erecting bronze monuments to people. And if it did, choosing Kathy Kosychenko to be the first one isn't sound governance. It's pandering and virtue signaling.

I'd like to talk about conditional zoning. I've written you  And spoken, the conditional zoning is complicated and counterintuitive. And I really wish we would have addressed it more publicly when we spoke about Southtown, where there was a conditional zoning. Unfortunately, council members, not all of you, some of you, chose to make disparaging comments about your constituents rather than addressing the meat of the arguments and the issues that were raised by those speakers at that meeting about Southtown.  That was unseemly. Unseemly. Where have we heard that word recently? When we were talking about conditional zoning at Lowertown, Lisa Dish used that word. After making some comments that were completely incorrect about conditional zoning regarding the third phase of Lowertown, she criticized people who were  proposing things for that project that they were hoping the developer might deliver on as unseemly things to ask for. Things like, oh, affordable housing, or sustainability in the form of further electrification. Maybe retail instead of a second pool, only half mile from Fuller Pool. I don't think those things were unseemly. You may differ in your opinion about it. But certainly, you were incorrect, Lisa, in your statements about conditional zoning.  because it was not the case that this was somebody applying for a project with conditional zoning. It was a developer who had already had conditional zoning put upon their property, asking for it to be removed. Very different. Let's get back to Southtown. There were a lot of meaty issues that could have been discussed, and most of them were not discussed. For example, we could have debated, discussed at the council table,  the non-primary residence short-term rental issue. Not too long ago, the city passed an ordinance banning those in residential zoning. Recently, more recently than that, in crafting the TC1 zoning, they were banned in TC1 as well. So we have residential zoning being converted to non-residential zoning, and in this case, Southtown, giving them up to 60 units  Are we giving a monopoly to this particular developer, or are we opening the door for more? That would have been a good point for discussion, rather than spending your time disparaging your constituents. I hope we have a better discussion next time.

I want to talk about an outstanding issue and then some positive action that's happened over the last week. But first, this is the crosswalk that I have been talking about.  Why hasn't staff addressed the concerns? And in one case, and I outlined this in the memo, the crosswalk sign is more than six feet in front of the actual crosswalk. So trimming was done around the crosswalk sign and then there is a wall of vegetation before you get to the crosswalk. Defies logic.  And you may say, why am I addressing this to council? Council sets budgets and council passes policies. That's absolutely right. But council passes budgets and sets policies for new programs, new programs. That's what we do in Ann Arbor. We don't evaluate our programs, even though that's very important with Vision Zero. We don't have feedback loops. We just go on to the next project.  And it's extremely frustrating as someone who's been to Vision Zero training to see us cherry pick aspects of it. We are not reducing our pedestrian crashes. We are not meeting our safety goals as we heard earlier. Now for the good news. I went to many of the house party events this week.  And it exceeded all of my expectations. It was so wonderful talking to people who I didn't necessarily agree with, but.  They listened to me, I listened to them, and I learned so much. It was wonderful. And one of the things that came out of it is that construction costs for middle-income families exceeds the market rate of that property in Ann Arbor. And that means that private developers will not be building middle-income housing in Ann Arbor.  It's not financially feasible. But there are ways to build thousands of units, and that is with  Community Land Trust, working with the University of Michigan. The county right now is looking at a housing commission that would support not only low-income housing, but also middle-income housing. So I believe that we are going to have some plans that are very complicated, but are going to be made public in the next few weeks.  And so, again, I don't think it's the city's responsibility and we definitely don't want to be using the affordable housing millage for middle income housing, but there are other creative ways to do it.

The argument seems to be that she should have faced more open discrimination, broken more barriers, made LGBTQ plus issues more central to her campaign or legislative work, championed more to earn this distinction.  at a time when LGBTQ rights are under assault nationwide, it seems quite obvious to me why we would want to honor her and Ann Arbor's place in history and let others know that Ann Arbor is a safe haven.

Kathy, as an openly gay elected official, I am lucky to stand on Kathy's shoulders. Regardless of the tenure that she had here, what she was able to accomplish, what she, she stepped forward to serve her community and ran openly and honestly as who she was and  was elected and the fact that our community was somehow too accepting of her as being a problem or something that we shouldn't recognize because she didn't face enough discrimination during her campaign or enough pushback. It's just shocking to me. I think it's an example of why we need to elevate her and other people like her. And I will also say, I think,  public art is meant to spark conversation.

My name is Scott Munsell. My office is at 301 North Main proud member of the mighty 5th Ward I'm the attorney representing Andy and Julie Reif who own the property We're here today to request a rezoning from our 1c to office Andy and his family have owned that property since the 70s. There's a  Two lots involved. There's a small house and some storage buildings. Over the years, the ability to rent that for residential has become less and less attractive. And a few years ago, Andy moved his small commercial cleaning business in to the house. He has two to three employees.  And however, in 2022, the zoning administrator dropped by and said, hey, this is zoned residential. You can't have an office in this small house. So we've been working since then to address this particular issue. A key thing to remember, Andy,  and intends to continue using the building for his office. He has no plans to change the site at all. If there were ever to be a change in the future, there would need to be a site plan where issues of lighting, noise, traffic, et cetera, et cetera, would be addressed through the appropriate planning process. But he has no plans to change anything now and just continue running his very, very small business. The rezoning to office makes sense.  Both for Andy's use and also because in the zoning area it would act as an appropriate buffer between The residential uses to the west and the north and the very very busy commercial activity on the other side of Ann Arbor Sleen Road  particularly the gas station, which is immediately across the street and which has become increasingly busy over the years. We held the citizens participation meeting, addressed questions, we went to the planning commission, it recommended approval eight to nothing. And I'll just say there are two particular reasons why this rezoning makes sense. First, the city council's entitled to rezone property when there's been a change in conditions.  Number one, and then also number two, this change is consistent with the master plan. As has been noted, the change in conditions on why it's no longer appropriate for single family fronting on Ann Arbor-Saline Road, as opposed to the houses to the north, which all gain access from the back. They don't gain access. If you think about Ann Arbor-Saline Road in that area, all the houses to the, what should that be, northeast, they all,  their backyards front Ann Arbor Saline. They do not gain access from Ann Arbor Saline. In any event, there's been a change, a dramatic increase in traffic along that road created by the huge retail activity on the south side of 94 there. Again, I noted across the street an increase in commercial activity. It's really just no longer appropriate for single family housing.  Secondly, this change would be consistent with the master plan. As I mentioned, office is a zoning designation intended to be a buffer between conflicting land uses. And in this particular case, it would make a great deal of sense to shield the multifamily to the west and the residential to the north in a way from the more active commercial to the east.  It also is consistent with the sustainability element of the master plan, which envisions a higher level of density. The particular or activity, I should say, it's right on a bus line. It would be very appropriate for if it were to ever be developed, it would make more sense of the scarce urban land that we have in the city. And so we request that you support the request for rezoning.  And we're happy to answer any questions later.

I need to say what we are asked to do here, even though the Mayor has said that. We are asked to approve a rezoning for two properties, 2670 and 2690 Ann Arbor-Saline Road, and it will be an intensification of use from R1C to O.  I understand the concerns that have been expressed. I hear that you feel that this decision has been approved without hearing from you, but it hasn't been approved. It's been reviewed by the Planning Commission, which recommends that council approve it. Public notice was given for the Planning Commission meeting, but you might be out of range because we notice within 300 feet for rezoning. But you're here now and we are listening to you.  Some of the concerns that were raised about increased traffic. It sounded to me as if folks may not be aware that 2670 Ann Arbor Saline Road has been used as an office space for approximately the past four years and there are 2.5 full-time employees and  who work there from 930 to 5, Monday through Friday. There are no vans, business, commercial trucks parked outside the facility. The other building, 2690 Ann Arbor Saline, has been used as an indoor personal storage site for the past 40 years. None of that is permitted by the residential zoning, and so we are asked to rezone in order to bring the petitioner into conformity.  Now I understand why there would be concerns because moving from a residential to an office zoning is unusual. It is an intensification of use, but Planning Commission judged that an intensification of use makes sense for this property, particularly in the context where there is in this area  a fair amount of commercial activity, a highway and a gas station. But I also want to emphasize that there is protection for current residents. Any future expansion of either of the two buildings or their parking lots would require a formal site plan submission and would have to be reviewed and approved by the Planning Commission and or City Council, depending on what the nature of the change was.  So all we are doing here is allowing what's already happening there.  And should there be an expansion, we would have, Planning Commission or us, depending on how big, would have a chance to evaluate whether it was appropriate for the context. So I supported this on Planning Commission. And I think it is safe to support now. But I understand that sometimes just the feeling of not being heard can make, can stir opposition.

Staff review would include ensuring that whatever hypothetical site plan would come in with respect to these parcels, that it would meet whatever traffic study requirements, that it would meet lighting requirements, if any, that it would meet stormwater requirements, all those utility ability criteria.  All those would be reviewed by staff and compliance obligated prior to it being brought forward. So I'm appreciating the concern about the absence of those things at this juncture. The reason for that is because there is no change contemplated or proposed at this time to the use. It's merely an alteration of the zoning to conform with a longstanding use. Further discussion?  All in favor? Oh, I'm sorry, Council Member Dino."}, {"start": 4563.158, "end": 4617.409, "speaker": "SPEAKER_09", "text": "Thank you.

And so I do think, you know, it's also potentially a missed opportunity for us to be thinking more long term about  what could really go in here and in terms of housing for residents and being within immediate walking distance of the amenities that they need.

So that is the primary reason for this change, so that we can actually make sure that we get affordable housing at this site. The other deed restriction that this will be developed as affordable housing will remain in place. I will say that I also think that if I had, that this  provides additional security for us that our affordable housing millage funds are secure in the sense that at no point in time would this actually be turned back over to the city at no cost.

I want to talk about an outstanding issue and then some positive action that's happened over the last week. But first, this is the crosswalk that I have been talking about.  Why hasn't staff addressed the concerns? And in one case, and I outlined this in the memo, the crosswalk sign is more than six feet in front of the actual crosswalk. So trimming was done around the crosswalk sign and then there is a wall of vegetation before you get to the crosswalk. Defies logic.  And you may say, why am I addressing this to council? Council sets budgets and council passes policies. That's absolutely right. But council passes budgets and sets policies for new programs, new programs. That's what we do in Ann Arbor. We don't evaluate our programs, even though that's very important with Vision Zero. We don't have feedback loops. We just go on to the next project.  And it's extremely frustrating as someone who's been to Vision Zero training to see us cherry pick aspects of it. We are not reducing our pedestrian crashes. We are not meeting our safety goals as we heard earlier. Now for the good news. I went to many of the house party events this week.  And it exceeded all of my expectations. It was so wonderful talking to people who I didn't necessarily agree with, but.  They listened to me, I listened to them, and I learned so much. It was wonderful. And one of the things that came out of it is that construction costs for middle-income families exceeds the market rate of that property in Ann Arbor. And that means that private developers will not be building middle-income housing in Ann Arbor.  It's not financially feasible. But there are ways to build thousands of units, and that is with  Community Land Trust, working with the University of Michigan. The county right now is looking at a housing commission that would support not only low-income housing, but also middle-income housing. So I believe that we are going to have some plans that are very complicated, but are going to be made public in the next few weeks.  And so, again, I don't think it's the city's responsibility and we definitely don't want to be using the affordable housing millage for middle income housing, but there are other creative ways to do it.
