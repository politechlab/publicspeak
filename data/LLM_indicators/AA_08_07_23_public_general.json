My name is Brandon Dimchow from West Larrytown in Fourth Ward, less than half a mile from the proposed rezoning for C1. And I'm calling in today to support C1 and say how excited I am to see a mass timber project proposed in Ann Arbor. And so I hope you approve this first reading of C1 tonight.  C1AR zoning seems entirely appropriate for this area. It's right across the street from the athletic campus, near a bunch of other student housing and stuff. And the plan here will provide much needed housing while being way less carbon intensive than most of our other structures in the city. The site plan also provides a free public plaza that's about the size of the library lane surface parking lot, and it provides it at no expense to the city.  So please support C1. Also, while I can't speak to the details of C3, I'm generally supportive of regulations that allow people to make informed decisions. I happen to luck out by purchasing a relatively well-insulated house that isn't incredibly expensive and wasteful to heat and cool, but much of our housing stock is older and poorly insulated. A purchaser may not know they're in for thousands of dollars of insulation work or thousands of dollars of extra energy bills.  It seems perfectly reasonable to require disclosures around energy consumption during a real estate transaction so that new home buyers know what to expect and also to encourage sellers to make energy efficiency improvements prior to sale.

Lower Burns Park, close to Stadium Boulevard, the  the east part of Stadium Boulevard, but that's a handy commute to the west part of Stadium Boulevard, which is part of the proposed TC zoning, TC1 zoning. And I want to speak to TC1 in opposition to two of the changes that have been proposed to making it easier for car dealerships and car rental agencies to set up shop.  Car dealerships and car rental agencies are densely car-centered businesses. They're businesses that exist because of the car, in order to get you to drive a car, and are completely car-brained. A typical additional new car on the road will rack up thousands, if not tens of thousands of miles. Having any kind of  improvement to the ability for businesses in the city to sell and rent cars is at odds with our stated goals. It's at odds with our goals to reduce vehicle miles traveled because what can you do with the car? You can travel some vehicle miles.  It's at odds with our complete streets because these businesses are very car-dense uses. And it's at odds with pedestrian bicycle safety because the sorts of roads that you get when you have lots of car dealerships are roads effectively known as stroads or street roads.  And some people have wittily referred to them as car sewers because they're wide and they're deep and they're nearly impossible to cross on foot or on bicycle. They're dangerous. And things that we can do to reduce the vehicle intensity of our city are all good. So I'm opposed to the proposed changes to TC1 that would  Allow car dealerships and car rental agencies as Even except even special exception uses. I don't see any particular reason.

I will be talking tonight about two items on the consent agenda that total to about a million dollars that are basically for the public right of way, sort of for pedestrian safety. But what I want to say is that  there's a complete lack of any feedback or focus on operations within the pedestrian safety area. And as a council member, I was frequently accused of being negative to staff or negative to my council members. I've given this a lot of thought. The problem is that we have a local political machine  that is focused on more shiny new things. Staff realizes that they will be roadkill if they don't go along with this amorphous political machine in our community.  That said, the city is liable, so the political machine can go over there and do whatever they want, but the city is liable if we have dangerous situations in our community that are not being addressed by the city. Situations that have been identified in writing time after time, and one includes a letter where the city committed to taking actions back in 1998  to keep the vegetation cleared from the right away in the King School neighborhood. That is not being done. It is extremely dangerous and now we will have many vehicles cutting through there because they cannot go southbound on Earhart and they will be using these neighborhood roads to drop their kids off, especially at Saint Paul School. We also have issues of signage. What I call the  A, backwards crosswalk signs, crosswalk signs that are backwards, they're still backwards.

My name is Tom Renkert. I'm the CEO for the Ann Arbor Area Board of Realtors. We represent 1,100 real estate professionals in the Ann Arbor area. On behalf of our membership, I'm here today to speak in opposition to the Home Energy Rating Disclosure Ordinance.  Although we applaud the city's efforts, this ordinance does little to help the city to achieve the 8 to 0 goals. It targets a small group of owners selling their homes, which is given by the owner to the buyer, who typically does not have the financial resources to act on the recommendations that are presented through the ordinance.  We have worked openly with the city staff and the Energy Commission to thoroughly understand the proposed ordinance and are aware of the city's plans to hire one home energy assessor, even though the ordinance does not include the cost of the assessment for the city to bear this expense.  Keeping in mind that the city staff has also pointed out that they have met with additional firms to help with assessments. Staff is clearly aware that one assessor will not be able to meet the demands in a timely fashion, potentially stalling home sales and or adding additional cost to the transaction.  If you would please, consider our rental housing inspection process as a framework for energy assessment. With as many as five inspectors on staff, it can take several weeks and sometimes several months to have a rental property inspected. Most importantly, and as pointed out in our August 3rd letter to city council, sellers will not be able to meet the advertisement requirements of the ordinance.  Additionally, it's clear from the 30-month report to the Portland City Council that most buyers are not in a financial position to make this kind of improvement needed to increase their score significantly. If by chance they are, realtors locally point out that buyers will prioritize the need to improve their home, such as making updates to kitchens or baths over adding installation to their homes.  Either way, after making one of the largest investments of their lifetime, the facts from the Portland study show that new buyers simply do not choose to make energy-based improvements to their homes. Lastly, let's keep in mind that this is a very basic checklist. It's not a blow-door test. It estimates the cost to heat, cool, and light the property. Rather than an estimate, please remember that buyers can contact DTE and obtain an actual cost for recent years.  Honorable council members, we respectfully ask that you empower city staff to design an incentive based energy assessment program, a model that others will follow a program that will empower all Ann Arbor homeowners to actively participate in achieving the 8 to 0 goals rather than a forced program for sellers who will only face punishment after leaving our great city.

I'm here to encourage you to vote yes in support of Carytown Concert House's club liquor license application with the city of Ann Arbor.  Carytown Concert House is proud to be entering its 39th year as a non-profit arts venue, a cultural gem in our community that offers a unique opportunity to enjoy exceptional artists in an intimate historical setting that is unlike any other concert experience in Ann Arbor.  This coming 23-24 season, we have plans to present 90 concerts with a culturally diverse and eclectic combination of local, national, and international world-class artists. As the Artistic and Executive Director, I believe this club license is instrumental to the future growth of the organization and would greatly enhance our ability to serve the community and attract folks to the Carytown Farmers Market in Carytown area.  For the past few decades, KCH has routinely applied for and used all 12 allowable special license from the state each year for special events. KCH founders, a club of supporters who give $300 or more annually, have expressed a desire to have more than 12 opportunities to enjoy wine or beer at KCH in a given year.  After decades of going through the arduous process of obtaining the special license, the KCH Board of Trustees now supports a club liquor license for the organization, as it would allow us to more easily build community among its founders club by routinely offering concert afterglows and other events especially for them, such as artists meet and greets, including wine and beer.  It will also help us generate additional revenue for KCH through increased concession sales. And it would allow us to thoughtfully target concerts and special events that would lend themselves well to the inclusion of alcohol concessions, such as concerts held on New Year's Eve or Valentine's Day, our Dance Hall Night Series, our Wine Women and Song Concert Series, or concerts that occur in conjunction with other area events, such as Kindle Fest or Ann Arbor Pride.  It would also offer us the opportunity to give a similar scenario as happens at other iconic venues here in Ann Arbor, such as the Arc and the Michigan Theater. On behalf of the KCH staff and board of trustees, I want to thank you for your favorable consideration of our application and assure you that we will use the license with appropriate care and responsibility. We look forward to your support and also to seeing you at the house for a concert soon. Thank you very much for your time."}, {"start": 1082.254, "speaker": "SPEAKER_15", "text": "Hi, this is Alex Lowe. I'd like to speak to you on three topics tonight. First, CA10, the purchase of a new wood chipper, combined with CA11, the rental of street sweepers.  While I'm in favor of both of these and don't believe they should be at all controversial, the fact that as a city we're willing to purchase or rent new fossil fuel powered devices for these purposes that have spent years delaying the purchase of similar equipment size for bike lanes shows a sort of double think with respect to our environmental goals.  For bike lanes, we're reducing the effectiveness of these energy-saving, emissions-reducing bike lanes by demanding a very high bar for the maintenance equipment that we buy, a bar that we simply are not applying to other purchases by the city. If studied, I would reasonably expect  that purchasing even a diesel-powered street sweeper for the bike lanes that would allow us to make them properly separated and protected would have net negative emissions due to the car trips that would be turned into bike trips. The same cannot be said for either of the items on these orders tonight. If we truly want to meet our 80-0 goals,  we should be willing to do the potentially unpalatable but still very effective things to help achieve these goals, especially if we're willing and able to do those same unpalatable things for goals unrelated to H2O. Second, I'd like to speak on the TC1 amendment, C2. I'm  deeply concerned about the addition of automobile-related uses, even with a special exception as primary uses. There's no indication that these exceptions will be within the spirit of TC1, and the addition of automobile-related uses as a valid primary use runs a strong risk of entirely defeating the purpose of the TC1 district.  Please reconsider this. Finally, I'd like to request that the city make a bike lane gap dashboard similar to the very useful sidewalk gap dashboard we have. This dashboard should not simply be bike lane or no bike lane, but rather include a level of service. 30 seconds. And abilities. No bike lane is obviously a gap, but painted bicycle gutters or even buffered bike lanes that have a whole  Two strips of paint a car would have to cross to kill a bicyclist are woefully insufficient. We need safe infrastructure and council should be aware of the current state of our infrastructure. The dashboard's one step to that.

I moved to Ann Arbor about a year ago from Evanston.  where my partner was a graduate student at Northwestern. It's a very similar kind of college town. And there, we rented a one-bedroom apartment about 550 square feet for $1,200 a month. We anticipated moving here that we'd be able to find similar rentals because the cost of living comparisons suggest that Ann Arbor is only 1.5% to 2% more expensive than Evanston. We were shocked then to discover  that a comparable apartment here is $1,600 a month, which is 33% more expensive than what we were paying. It is particularly egregious because salaries here are about the same as they are in Evanston. So this represents a large percentage of our income. I rent from McKinley Properties at Traver Crossing now, which we have found to be less than desirable. We've had issues with mold.  a hot water heater that is constantly in and out of service, as well as struggling to get any kind of maintenance for things as simple as a light switch repair. Public spaces, for example, the laundry room is consistently covered in mold, has standing water, and roof ceiling tiles that disintegrate and are not repaired despite repeated requests for maintenance.  We've had five property managers since I've been here, which is only a year. So there's been no continuity in management for tenants. And just a very small example of the lack of respect for tenants, the washing machines changed from being coin-operated to being app-operated recently. The app itself is buggy, and in its privacy policy, it says that  Not only does it collect all of your data, your demographics, your location, your employment, your name, your birthday, your email, your phone number, it can and will sell it to third parties and other vendors that they can use in their marketing materials. And I don't know about you, but I don't really like it when my washing machine is selling my data. So I tried to use a wash card where you pre-fill it. But the pre-filling card station is located in the property management office.  which has been closed all summer because our property manager is managing four other properties and has been unable to be on the property at all. This is not what I signed up for. This is not what we pay for. And I'm really hoping that Ann Arbor City Council will continue its work for tenants' rights to make these situations better. Thank you."}, {"start": 1700.525, "speaker": "SPEAKER_28", "text": "Hello, my name is Claire Armisen. I'm here as a renter, a member of the Graduate Employee Organization Housing Caucus, and a member of the McKinley Tenants Association. My five years as a renter at Travers Crossing, a McKinley property in Ward 1, have been defined by the mismanagement of my rental property, including management authorizing entry into my apartment for repair without my permission or notification, urgent maintenance tickets for things like backup kitchen sinks getting left unassigned by management for days at a time.  an exterior building door that was jammed shut for two days during the winter, such that the only exit to my building was an iced-over door not maintained for winter use, and the same exterior door being left unlocked without a handle for weeks, even as I received notifications from the property to beware of package theft and multiple emails from the management office left unanswered.  It's logical to ask why I haven't moved to a different property. But last year, after management increased my rent by $125 per month, and then, as I was deciding whether or not to remove my lease, retracted this offer and raised my rent an additional $50 per month, I tried to find a new apartment. I soon learned that McKinley Properties owns 60% of the workforce housing in Washtenaw County, making it nearly impossible to leave a McKinley property.  When I did find some alternatives, each property had a waitlist for new tenants and a waitlist fee, usually around $350. Even though these fees are refundable, a spot on a waitlist did not guarantee a unit, and I would need to make multiple deposits or run the risk of not getting an apartment. I could not afford to pay hundreds of dollars in waitlist fees, essentially interest-free loans to landlords, but also could not risk finding myself without an apartment. So I was forced to stay in my McKinney apartment.  Again, this spring, when it came time for my renewal, the new lease came along with a $220 per month increase and an increase to late fees and pet fees. Last time I spoke at a city council meeting, it was in support of the right to renew ordinance, which passed last fall. This, along with the early leasing ordinance and creation of the renter commission, marked important steps the council has taken toward giving security to tenants and holding landlords accountable. But there is much more that can and needs to be done. First, eliminating both refundable and non-refundable fees that prohibit many renters  from finding, moving from, or staying in an apartment. Second, ensuring that existing ordinances and building codes are enforced, and proactively addressing tenant issues by working with the Renters Commission to expand renter protection. And finally, endorsing the effort to repeal the statewide rent stabilization preemption and refer local government power to make laws about equitable rent.  She used the words of McKinley CEO Albert Barrett, who spoke on a Claims Detroit podcast last year. 30 seconds. 100% of Washtenaw County, if not just 60%. If city council does not take action to protect renters, the city will soon be owned by its landlord. Thank you very much."}, {"start": 1880.008, "speaker": "SPEAKER_10", "text": "Good evening. Sometimes it doesn't take a revisionist to enlighten us about the exaggerations we find in the Holocaust narrative. Often the enlightenment comes at the hands of the Holocaust traditionalists themselves. Recommended reading from the Anna Republic School's Holocaust curriculum is the well-known novel Night by the famous Elie Wiesel, page 32.  Not far from us, huge flames were rising from a ditch. Something was being burned there. A truck drew close and unloaded its hold. Small children, babies. Yes, I did see this with my own eyes. Children thrown into the flames. Is it any wonder that ever since then, sleep tends to elude me?  And in another book by the same author, The Jews of Silence, he writes about the alleged massacre of 33,000 Jews in Babi Yar in the Ukraine.  From page 48, we read, eyewitnesses say that for months after the killings, the ground continued to spurt geysers of blood. Without supporting evidence, Wiesel wants us to believe that blood spurted out of the ground in geyser-like fashion for months, when no one has ever seen such an occurrence. But in a third book, Legends of Our Time, Wiesel comes clean.  In the introduction, he writes about a conversation with the local rabbi. What are you writing, the rabbi asked, stories. I said he wanted to know what kind of stories, true stories. About people you knew? Yes, about people I might have known. About things that happened? Yes, about things that happened or could have happened. But they did not? No, not all of them did.  In fact, some were invented from almost the beginning to almost the end. The rabbi leaned forward as if to measure me up and said with more sorrow than anger, that means you are writing lies. I did not answer immediately. The scolded child within me had nothing to say in his defense, yet I had to justify myself. Things are not that simple, rabbi. Some events do take place but are not true.  Others are, although they never occurred. What will the reaction of Ann Arbor students be when they read of such an admission?

Once before I moved in and again after in two different rooms. Still have a plush toy that's got some damage. So you can see why my partner got anxious when we discovered a cabinet door in our current kitchen would no longer open all the way because it was scraping against a drooping ceiling.  We had to report the ceiling three times. At first, we reported just that it was drooping, then that there were cracks that had begun to spread. And finally, after almost two full months with no response, we submitted a report that let them know the ceiling now sagged several feet across. Along with those reports, I had to call at least twice.  In the end, they got a contractor to come out, ignore our instructions to contact us before entering, and get drywall all over our kitchen.

Okay. Sorry about that technical issue.  Yes, my name is Justin Yuan, and I've been a McKinney property tenant for three years. I am calling in on the issue of non-refundable fees and tenant applications. Even as they raise their rent year after year, landlords charge fees for applying to wait lists, to applying to rental properties, and everything in between. They want to make money, not just on the people who are having to sign leases, but everyone who's even looking for housing in the area, right? Something that we all need in this age of human rights.  Even when these fees are ostensibly refundable, it's extremely difficult and nigh impossible to actually get refunded. I urge City Council to eliminate non-refundable fees and heavily restrict even refundable fees in order to remove the burden from tenants who can't bear this cause as much as a landlord who might lose out on 50 bucks. This is a necessary step in addressing the larger issue at hand of landlord greed and overreach.  The result of recent reforms, like the early leasing ordinance and right to renew, show that landlords themselves, whether they're huge corporate monstrosities like McKinley or even so-called office-top landlords, can't be trusted to obey these things on their own. They can't be trusted to follow new reforms that get passed and can't be trusted to follow standards, regulations, and guidelines that already exist.  We need to fully fund the departments, offices, and relevant mechanisms to enforce everything that we have on the board already and go further in strengthening that infrastructure and building up the capacity to fully hold landlords to account and make sure that we have housing that we can live in, that we can not just live in and keep the rain on us, but live dignified lives, where we don't have to deal with mold, respiratory issues. We don't have to deal with structural issues that put our compartments away.  where we can live like human beings. I highly urge city council to take tenants' rights seriously. In my day job, I'm a union organizer. And we all know, as many of you do on city council, that workers are on the back foot. But when I started doing this housing stuff, when I started having housing issues of my own, I found that tenants, the rights for tenants and the fight that we have makes the fight that we're waging on the worker organizing side seem like a cakewalk.  It's absolutely brutal, and we have little to no recourse on a wide, wide range of issues. No, we're all workers, whether we're in the workplace or out of the workplace. And I know many of you on this council make a big deal out of your co-worker credentials.

That was a standard that was previously applied to our C2B commercial zoning district for similar uses. The proposed ordinance  carries that forward to the TC1. That adds a little bit, it adds additional restrictions in that regard on top of the already form-based restrictions of the TC1 district."}, {"start": 5511.192, "speaker": "SPEAKER_16", "text": "Yeah. Thank you, Council Members Dish and Briggs. It is not. The TC1 does require surface parking, but it limits the surface parking to be no larger  than 100% of the building footprint or 125% of the building footprint, depending on the lot size. Parking above that, that is still below the overall maximum parking of 1,333 square feet of use would have to be enclosed in a building or in a structure on top of that."}, {"start": 5581.306, "speaker": "SPEAKER_16", "text": "There can be vehicular parking for employees, for customers coming and going, but the restriction would require that the actual vehicle's being required to be in an enclosed space. I do wanna make it clear that zoning is perspective, so keep in mind that's going to apply to new uses that are established under these parameters in the TC1 district."}, {"start": 5893.482, "speaker": "SPEAKER_16", "text": "Yeah, so  That's one of the purposes of first reading is to make sure this ordinance gets into the appropriate configuration and language that you want to share with the community in advance of the second reading and public hearing. I think to Council Member Dish's point, it's going to have an impact on not only the TC1 district, but also the C2B district, but it is the same section that's referenced. So I certainly don't have any concerns about  this ordinance in advance of second reading and publication. It is in a section of the code that is reflective of additional regulations that we apply in this case to automobile truck construction and equipment repair. I don't think it would require a lot of reconfiguration of this proposed ordinance. So if the council is supportive of it, I think it's something we can accomplish before second reading."}], "public_hearings_3": [], "public_hearings_4": [], "public_hearings_5": [], "public_hearings_6": [], "public_comments_4": []}
