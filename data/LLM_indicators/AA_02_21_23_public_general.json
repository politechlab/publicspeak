And I am here tonight over the phone to support Council Member and Mayor Pro Tem Rodina's resolution to support common sense gun safety measures. And he and I were kind of talking about  you know, what does common sense mean? Because we understand it, it means different things for different people. And let me just say that what we are asking for and what is being introduced in our state Senate right now, soon to hopefully be introduced in the House, are safe gun safety bills that are supported by the majority of Americans that will keep us safe. Things like secure gun storage, things like red flag laws, and things like  Sorry, safe storage, red flag law, and oh my gosh, background checks on all gun sales. Hello. So this is going to be having a hearing in Lansing on Thursday, and many of us Moms in Action and other gun violence prevention organization supporters will be there to hear the Senate.  as they propose these bills. And so we just really appreciate the work of this city and know that there are things that can be done at the local level, like doing a resolution like Council Member Radina is introducing. So just here in support and thanking all of you for the work that you are doing. Thanks."}, {"start": 483.399, "speaker": "SPEAKER_10", "text": "Roberts, I'm an attorney. I was a vendor at the street fair last year, and I'm here to speak in support of granting the street fair permit. I think it's important to remember the history of the street fair. The street fair started about 20 years ago to address a very real issue, and that issue was the lack of infrastructure at the Hash Bash. Specifically,  the ability to wash your hands, cleaning up afterwards, subsidizing the police and fire response, as well as just, you know, kind of generally cleaning up at the end, because they clean it up every single year. And that is something that  You know, I think the hash bash needs. The hash bash is going to happen regardless if the street fair happens. The hash bash and the street fair, in most people's minds, there's no distinction. It is one in the same. You take away the street fair, those 10, 15,000 people are still going to show up to the hash bash. Then the question becomes, if they're at the hash bash, they got to use the bathroom, where are they going to go?  And the answer is twofold. One, they go to the local restaurants and they cause a nuisance. And we know because there's a lot of complaints before the street fair about that. Or number two, I mean, they use the city as a sewer. And they go wherever it is convenient for them. And I don't think that's good for anyone involved.  I do want to also address the public safety concern. Because that was brought by the police and it was brought by fire. And I believe it's unfounded. I believe not having the street fair is actually going to cause public safety concerns. Because you have 10,000, 15,000, 20,000 highly intoxicated 20-somethings. And if we don't close off those streets,  I'd rather have them in the streets without cars than in a street with cars because these people are not, you know, sober and they may not make great decisions. And I think it would be a lot better for everyone if we did close off those streets. So what I'm saying is, if you deny the street fare permit,  I believe it's going to cause the very issues that the city and fire are saying are going to happen if you actually grant it. It's going to cause public safety concerns. It's going to cause nuisances to nearby residents. It's going to cause a big mess that the street fair isn't going to be around to clean up this year. And, you know,  It's bad for the community. I mean, it's something where people are going to need these services, and they're going to go to hash bash. So then the question for you is, are you going to allow them to have it, or are you going to deny the permit, and people won't have a place to go to the bathroom, wash their hands? And so for those reasons, I'd suggest you grant the permit."}, {"start": 679.143, "speaker": "SPEAKER_03", "text": "Hello. So the people of the cannabis culture community, whether it's medical or recreational, have spent and lost too much time in their homes hiding, in a car, behind a building. There isn't many events besides the hash bash over the years leading up to legalization.  This is one of the places where it's like a family reunion. We all meet family, friends, we talk about what's going on in the community, what are we gonna do for the next year, and how are we gonna structure the legalization, the recreational, and the medical all together to come together. A lot of the cannabis money that's given to the state of Michigan and to Ann Arbor  is from these stores. These stores are going to be on the Monroe Street Fair. They're the ones there supporting and giving them, the people, the community, education, the knowledge. I come from a place where I had a family member hurt in a car accident, filled him with drugs from the hospital.  If it wasn't for cannabis, this person wouldn't walk. So we need to be able to have a place where we can all meet and rejoice and, shoot, have a place to get together. Ann Arbor has always been the structured place. I've lived here for 40 years. This has been the place. Whether there's a permit or not, like this gentleman said, the people are coming. And there's nowhere for them to use the bathroom. Simple things that have to happen, except for on the Monroe Street Fair.  And boy, I've been there every year. The crew comes out, cleans up everything, and it's in perfect condition. I, over the years, have never seen where the police had more than good interaction with people at both events, which really, truly is the same people walking from one to the other.  the police are very friendly and really don't have anything to do besides watch all of us. So I don't believe the conflict of this football game in April in the mud is gonna be a conflict with this problem that we're having here. It should be a no-brainer that Ann Arbor was the one. They're known for the hash bash around the world. People come from around the world.  famous people and the medically ill that have somewhere to go. So thank you for your time."}, {"start": 835.348, "speaker": "SPEAKER_20", "text": "Next up we have Lenny Sinclair. Everybody heard of the thing about  If you don't remember the past, you're bound to repeat it. And I would like to explain a little bit about what happened to us about 50 years ago in Ann Arbor and in the Ann Arbor City Council. When my husband, my ex-husband, John Sinclair, got out of jail after two and a half years, he started  back where he left off before he went to jail, and that's promoting music, managing bands, and he organized the 1972 and the 1973 Blues and Jazz Festivals in Ann Arbor, which were a great success and set the standard for festivals all in the country in terms of booking. And comes 1974,  The composition of the city council changed and there were people in the city council who denied us the permit to have the next festival in Detroit.  which was devastating because we had already contracted for the musicians to appear and had invested a lot of money. At the last minute, Windsor, University of Windsor, allowed us to have the festival in Windsor, which was a great disaster.  and led to us having to declare bankruptcy and having to move out of Ann Arbor and move to Detroit. That was in 1972, 51 years ago. So I just want to say that please, city council, don't cancel this culture on us.  That is our culture. We've been fighting for it and now it's legal. And now you want to cancel it? No, please don't. Thank you very much."}, {"start": 1192.567, "speaker": "SPEAKER_23", "text": "Hi, my name's Adam Senefani. I'm also here to support the Monroe Street Fair. As someone who's been coming to the Hash Bash since the early days before the fair, I remember what it was like back then. And you know, having to beg to use a bathroom or beg to get a drink of water. So frankly, I feel that  It really, since the Monroe Street Fair has been there, it's added and it's made things safer. It gives the people that are gonna come anyway somewhere to congregate afterwards rather than they're out bothering businesses.  You know, it gives people, again, it's a really positive environment as well as, you know, stepping up. It gives some of the businesses that are, you know, in the cannabis field a way to advertise. And again, it's just a good scene. It's a tradition now. The street fair's been going on for 23 years.  It just seems silly to stop something when we all know it's not a problem. And to not have the street fair is going to create issues that I don't think the city needs. So thanks for your time. Thank you."}, {"start": 1291.502, "speaker": "SPEAKER_22", "text": "Hello Ann Arbor.  Wow, we have lots of people really dedicated to cannabis. My vote is cancel this ugly orgy. This town does not need cannabis orgy. Cancel it. It's a source of embarrassment. But there's other things that are sources of embarrassment for people in Ann Arbor, and that is that our city council  has for a very long time, while pretending to be anti-violence, they have been allowing murder of Palestinian people in the hands of a racist apartheid state that is Israel.  I have come here for 20 years and I will continue to come because it is an embarrassment to this community, to this town, when every human rights organization in the world has declared Israel to be a violent, apartheid state. This city council continues to refuse to listen to the thousands who have been coming here since 1980s.  to say at the very least, pass the resolution, that we are against military aid to Israel.  This city council wants you to believe they're against violence. Wants you believe they are against gun violence. We have come here all these years with gun violence across the United States, happening almost every day. And we have said, if you are against gun violence inside the United States, you should be against gun violence outside the United States, especially when United States funds it.  United States gives Israel $4 billion a year, and guess where that money goes? To the slaughter of Palestinian people, particularly children. This poster depicts Ms. Iyer, who received  support from friends of Israeli Defense Forces. And now she makes faces at me, and she refuses to hand out this poster, which I handed out. And she says, we don't want your racist cartoon. This cartoon is not racist. It's depicting racists in Ann Arbor, which is Ms. Ayer, along with everyone else here, who refuses to take one step  to protect Palestinian people from the violence that the United States, with your tax dollar, is unleashing on them day in and day out. If you think police violence in America is bad, if you think mass murder  on the scale that you see in the United States, which is large and very, very sad, is bad. Think about what $4 billion a year buys Israeli racist government in terms of killing Palestinian people. Pass the resolution. We are against military aid to Israel or be called racist bastards."}, {"start": 1494.083, "speaker": "SPEAKER_12", "text": "I'm Larry Deck speaking regarding the East Medical Bridge. You've heard me before, and you may recall from our previous communications, speaking on behalf of Bike Washtenaw, that we'd like to see two things on the bridge. Widening the west sidewalk to about 15 feet to make room for bi-directional bike lanes and a pedestrian lane, which would also serve as part of a campus-to-campus bikeway, and building the planned trail loop under the bridge, which would also be a part of that bikeway. We think it should be straightforward to resolve MDOT's concerns about that.  Now the proposal before you, as I understand it, would call for restoring some or all of the sidewalk space that was taken away in the earlier plan. I have some questions about that, and I'm not sure what the answers are. Is most of the cost of that due to an added beam being needed underneath and abutment support for that? And if so, how many feet of added sidewalk space could we get for an added beam?  If I understand the engineering drawings correctly, both about our current bridge and the planned future bridge, the current beams are about just under six feet apart, five feet, 11 inches, and a little bit more. If that's the case, then we could get approximately six feet of additional sidewalk space by adding a beam. So it'd be good, if this is true, it'd be good to verify that, both council and staff, to find out if that's true, and that may open an opportunity to widen that west sidewalk.  As you know, the city and university have carbon neutrality plans. The university's plan calls for a bikeway between North Campus and Central Campus. This facility could serve as a part of that bikeway.  Ann Arbor's A20 plan calls for a reduction of vehicle miles traveled by 2030 of 50% in Ann Arbor and 25% of trips by walking and biking in Ann Arbor by 2030. Now whether or not you think these goals are achievable, at least it would be good to work towards these goals.  This bridge gives us an opportunity to make progress towards these goals and an opportunity in one of the parts of town with some of the heaviest bicycle and pedestrian traffic. This bridge is a major long-term investment. It's important, we think, to do it right and not to make a $10 million mistake. Thanks."}], "public_comments_2": [{"start": 1838.745, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "text": "Wow. Aloha. My immediate family has taken five degrees from the University of Michigan, so we're familiar with the surroundings. When my wife and I were married here in 1953, do the math,  We went to Hawaii to raise our family. And when we retired from Hawaii in 1993, 30 years ago, we thought about California and Oregon as places to retire.  But we came to Ann Arbor. We found that we had been spending our off time in the summers trading houses with people in Ann Arbor. And they loved to trade houses with somebody who lived in Honolulu. So we settled in Ann Arbor 30 years ago, and we bought a house on the west side. And we have really enjoyed living here.  But in the recent years, we have had some misgivings about that. And I'd just like to raise a couple of issues. Our quality of life seems to have been declining here.  And one of the reasons we found was that there is traffic congestion now. There are more potholes as a result. There are high-rises going up, and there are vintage houses and vintage trees coming down to accommodate them. We find that the city council is really instrumental in this because they're offering gift  well, gift offerings of numerous sorts, but mainly of rezoning properties so that they can be developed upon. And in the long run, we have a feeling that the city council is really instrumental in this.  We have read recently in the New Yorker magazine that the city of Austin in Texas has made its city council into an instrument of profit making for developers and contractors.  And I don't like to see that our city council apparently is making itself such an instrument. But this is not Texas. This is Michigan. This is Ann Arbor. But we have a feeling that the majority on the... Have I gone through minutes?"}, {"start": 2042.618, "speaker": "SPEAKER_11", "text": "Great. So to start off, I found it interesting that at the last meeting, former council member Griswold spoke at public comment, among other things, expressing concern that reworking the plans for East Medical Center Drive Bridge to include adequate pedestrian and bike accommodations might add $2 million to the project cost.  And in some ways, I find this concerning too. But let's take a moment and consider why this is and how we got here. Nearly half of the estimated cost, not counting the contingency fund, is for a rework of the engineering plans that were completed over the last year. This means that had the previous council, including Council Member Griswold, as well as a few of you,  actually chosen to aggressively pursue a design that adequately accommodated all transportation modes, much of this additional cost could have been avoided. Or to put it another way, if we had had the current membership of city council a year ago, it might have saved the city and the university hundreds of thousands of dollars in a year of delay on this project. Better not for hypotheticals.  Main point is we should not fall prey to the sunk cost fallacy here. We will, as previous commenters said, have to live with this bridge for generations. So it's important, and it is worth paying the cost to get it right to the greatest extent we possibly can.  So I do want to offer sincere thanks to some of the folks on council and to Mr. DeHoney for this time standing up for the state of values of the city and getting us this far. Speaking before you in December, I characterized the previous bridge design as a capitulation. Now at least we can say it's a compromise. But it really is just that, a compromise.  We are compromising our city's goals and values by allowing a roadway to be widened to increase traffic volumes, speeds and potential conflicts. When we have adopted plans and objectives to do the opposite, we have objectives to reduce fatalities and serious injuries to zero and to cut our city's total vehicle miles traveled in half. We cannot do this. We cannot achieve any of this if we're going to keep on widening roads.  So in case you can't tell, I'm not exactly happy with the plan that's before you tonight. But I also recognize that this might be it, right? So my ask for you is first, please continue to keep a careful eye on transportation needs in the wider vicinity of this bridge, in the Fuller East Medical Center intersection. It's a critical linchpin in multiple biking and walking routes through the city.  There's a redesign of this intersection potentially coming down the road, so to speak, one which could be even more disastrous for these safety and sustainability goals if we do it wrong. And meanwhile, progress has not been made on long-planned pedestrian and bike underpass connections here for 40 years now."}, {"start": 2243.546, "speaker": "SPEAKER_18", "text": "Good evening. What you're deliberating tonight has been characterized as a bridge project, but at its core, it is a road widening. Widening a road, whether or not it adds lanes, increases the speed of the road. Faster driving means exponentially more human injuries. And of course, inviting more injuries contradicts your Vision Zero commitment to zero deaths and serious injuries by 2025. The discussion highlights three things that should be worrisome to anyone concerned about road safety.  One, you're debating among choices that will increase car speeds. Two, these choices made their way through staff to your packet in the first place. And three, this is just the latest in a series of examples of how your Vision Zero commitment is somehow not being communicated to or carried out by staff. Recent examples include the Lower Town Mobility Study, a tremendously expensive study that, despite referencing Vision Zero and carbon neutrality, was described by staff as addressing car congestion and was largely car-focused.  Platt Road. The plan to resurface Platt was going to leave it as a dangerous four-lane road. Thankfully, you directed staff to correct this. Huron Parkway. Staff recommended and you approved the resurfacing of Huron Parkway that also keeps it four lanes, maintaining highway speeds through a high school crosswalk where children have been injured. Just like with Platt, please direct staff to correct this. The Fuller and Maiden intersection. Designs were circulated last year that showed adding turn lanes and slip lanes.  How is it that any staff or consultant resources are being used for this? A Vision Zero approach might start by questioning why Polar Road has four dedicated car lanes in the first place, not how to widen it. And now the bridge. So we see a pattern. Why does this keep happening? Why wasn't staff's first instinct to remove lanes on this bridge or add cycling infrastructure? The traffic volume on the bridge is about half of that of South Main Street, where we removed lanes and saw dramatically reduced speeding. Was it U of M's money?  Is any amount of money worth endangering everyone using a road or its sidewalks? What if U of M offered $5 million for a redesign of Fuller and Maiden Lane so they can ram through thousands more cars to their new parking structure? Despite what U of M wants, the Cars First mentality in City Hall needs to end now so we can move forward. My request tonight with the bridge, specifically, is for you to direct staff to create a new design that removes the car lanes and increases the bike and pedestrian infrastructure.  In the broader picture, I ask four things. One, reaffirm your commitment to literally zero deaths and serious injuries by 2025, not fewer deaths and injuries than most of Michigan. Two, direct staff to do road diets by default, so proposals like this never come before you again. Three, remove regressive policies like the so-called neighborhood feedback veto process for sidewalks, traffic calming, and removing parking.  And four, institute other Vision Zero friendly policies like a roundabout first policy and prohibiting the use of car level of service and staff analysis. You're going to spend about a billion dollars over the next two years. Please follow the lead of many cities in the U.S. Thank you. Zero commitment. Thank you."}], "public_hearings_1": [], "public_hearings_2": []}
