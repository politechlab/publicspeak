They're crucial to the operation of our local democracy. We require community members to come forward and serve, and are so grateful for their joint and several collective work, advice, and wisdom.  In terms of work and advice and wisdom, I think there are very few to compare to Mr. White. Mr. White here has served for the city for decades now, the Historic District Commission for 18 years, and the Ann Arbor Board of Review for 30 years, and I am reading that correctly. In any event, it is  due to people like Mr. White that we are able, Commissioner White, that we are able to do the work of government.

Whereas Robert White has served as chair of the Board of Review and secretary and vice chair and chair of the Historic District Commission during his tenure.  Whereas Mr. Robert White has been the longest-serving commissioner in the Historic District Commission in his 50 years of existence and the longest-serving member on the Board of Review. Now, therefore, I, Christopher Taylor, Mayor of Ann Arbor, Michigan, do hereby recognize and thank Robert White for his contributions and dedicated service to the City of Ann Arbor and proclaim June 5, 2023, as a day to honor him at the conclusion of his service to the City of Ann Arbor, I should add, at least in these capacities."}, {"start": 489.922, "end": 527.621, "speaker": "SPEAKER_05", "text": "So, Mr. White.

ICPOC subcommittees continue to work. We have decided to forego our July and August meetings so we can enjoy some vacation time, but the subcommittees will continue to work. We have subcommittees looking at the policies and procedures for the police department to see if we need to tweak any of those, as well as getting our own policies and procedures in order.  We are specifically working to streamline the process of reviewing complaints. And we do plan to have our year-end report in by the end of 2023.

And I'm sure you also know that the Southeast, I want to make sure I get all the names right, the Southeast Michigan Criminal Justice Policy Research Project, known as SMART, that was the acronym for SMART, has been underway. The research has been going on for a little more than a year.  and that's been done at Eastern Michigan University. They've been conducting an analysis of traffic stops collected by the Ann Arbor Police Department for the period of time from January 2017 through December 31st, 2019.  The study was funded in large part through the Community Policing Innovations Initiative, a program of the Community Foundation of Southeast Michigan. The goal of the analysis was to identify any potential evidence of racial disparities that may be present with regard to police traffic stops.  And I am reporting today that that draft, I think I mentioned it a couple of months ago and we expected it to be out. The draft report is out. We have our copy. I think some of you members of council have received a copy of that report. If not, I spoke with Dr. Karpiak who's in charge of that study and it is forthcoming. But what I'd like to let you know  is that the analysis identified significant disparities across every dimension that they examined, with non-white motorists being stopped and searched more frequently across every dimension examined.  and white motorists being stopped and searched less frequently than would be expected in every instance. The largest disparity identified in the analysis involves African American male drivers for stops initiated for equipment violations, which occurred 2.4 times more likely than would have been expected.  In addition to the stops, searches after the initial stop occurred between 4 point, I'm sorry, 5.4 and 3.6 times more often with African American males. I think this is important. I know, we all have seen what negative interactions can occur as a result of a traffic stop. And I know that  This is important information. I'm aware of certain things that will be coming before this council, and I hope that you will consider this report when you look at things that I know are coming. We will be meeting, IPOC is going to be meeting with Dr. Karpiak, and we're going to talk to him about what they did, what they looked at, how they did the study. In the next two or three weeks, we expect that the commissioners will have met with Dr. Karpiak.  And we are planning a forum at our September meeting, which will be the fourth Tuesday in September. I think the date's the 24th. We will be inviting the public. We certainly are inviting any council members who wish to attend. And we're going to be discussing the report, which will be out in the public by that time.  That is what's new with us. If there are any questions, I'm happy to address them.

I live at 2340 Georgetown, and I am the current president of the Orchard Hills Maplewood Homeowners Association, a neighborhood bordering the Plymouth Road corridor.  I agree there is value in public transportation along major corridors. I understand that public transportation must be subsidized. I would support transportation nodes with mixed use if paired with a better transit system. I might support increasing density along corridors with existing transportation.  If the regulations were written to respect certain characteristics of those corridors, which TC1 does not do. I don't think one size fits all. Plymouth Road is not at all like State and Eisenhower, which had no natural features and no residential neighbors. Plymouth Corridor residents already live in a 15 to 20 minute walkable neighborhood. I think significant natural features, trees, wetlands, creek sheds like the Miller Creek are too valuable to our health  and well-being to be replaced. Traffic and pedestrian safety is vitally important, yet there's no plan to address this yet. Heights of TC1 buildings should not shade the backyards of adjacent residential lots.  I know Council has a vision for the future, but most Ann Arborites don't know that yet. I expect that could change during the public engagement portion of the rewrite of the comprehensive plan. What I don't understand is what made this resolution necessary. What is the urgency of this? What steps are considered extraneous? Does this mean you want to rezone these two corridors without any further public engagement?  What is the reason for outlawing any improvements in the ordinance before passing more mass zonings with what we know is a flawed ordinance? This resolution seems urgent, vague, and perhaps misleading. It sends a message that seems to say  We need to pass this before the comprehensive plan gets going and the public have a chance to alter it. Something is wrong here. I don't expect Council to always agree with me or any other resident. However, I respect, I expect respect, an opportunity for dialogue and an effective effort for addressing residents' concerns.  This resolution signals not caring to know what the public thinks because you have a vision and you fear it might fail if you inform the public.

The EDC's primary role to date has been to issue tax-exempt private activity revenue bonds for various projects in the city.  The EDC has not issued any of these bonds in a number of years due to low interest rates. This MOU will allow for the EDC to work closely with the city administrator to determine other activities and services that the EDC will provide.  The EDC is also aware of the comprehensive economic development services provided by Ann Arbor SPARK to the city.

I'm an attorney of counsel with the Mitchell Law Group and a longtime, EDC's been a longtime client. I'd just like to touch on a technical point here, backing up Professor Thompson's comments. The EDC is a separate entity from the city. A bond issued by the EDC is not a bond issued by the  By the city and vice versa. It's important to keep that distinction in mind The EDC is a is a way to for a eligible applicant for an eligible project to save Substantial sums on their financing costs. So it's it's been it's benefited many projects in the city over the years but as a bond issuing entity  it's required to comply with the requirements of both state and federal law.  Federal law is governing tax exempt obligations like EDC bonds. It's probably one of the, if not the, one of the most complex in the tax code. Arbitrage regulations and so forth. So that it's important that as a project goes forward that everything that can be done is being done to facilitate that process. One of the reasons, one of the,  underlying the MOU besides the ones that Professor Thompson mentioned, was to make very clear the paramount necessity that these bonds, no matter what these new enterprises are going to be, the new services and roles that the EDC may play for the city,  that underline all of it, there has to be compliance with these laws. So for that technical reason, that's, again, the other reason. The other, as she pointed out, was the tremendous opportunities for the city and the staff and  the board of the EDC to explore what these new roles and services may be. It's literally unlimited. So it should be exciting to see. So I, by all means, please regard the EDC as a partner and an entity looking very much forward to working with council and staff. I'll be here.

I'm here today to express support for the proposed humane pet store ordinance, especially prohibiting the potential future sale of dogs in pet stores. Puppy selling pet stores are a part of a greater pipeline which funnels sick and inhumanely bred puppies into the hands of consumers. The system completely lacks transparency and puppy purchasers don't know what cruelty they are supporting, which is puppy mills.  or commercial breeding facilities with recorded animal welfare violations and hundreds of dogs confined to small cages for the entirety of their lives. Pet stores often sell their puppies for thousands of dollars with false promises of humane, regulated sourcing and healthy, socialized puppies when this is very rarely true.  This ordinance would protect our community members from misleading sales tactics, sick puppy sales, high veterinary bills, and predatory lending that so often occurs when customers can't outright afford a puppy.  The reality is no pet store needs to sell animals in order to be successful. According to Pet Business Magazine, of the top 25 pet retailers in North America, only one sells puppies. And in 2022, that chain shrunk while competitors that didn't sell dogs grew. This is evidence that no pet store needs to sell dogs to be profitable. Pet stores can thrive by providing pet owners with everything they need to care for their pets, rather than selling the pets themselves. And this model is already followed by the vast majority of pet stores here in Michigan.  Six states and over 460 localities have prohibited the sale of dogs and cats in pet stores, including East Point, Fraser, New Baltimore, Royal Oak, Harbor Springs, St. Clair Shores, and newly Woodhaven here in Michigan.  These laws have shrunk demand for puppies bred in cruel conditions with public records showing 32,000 fewer breeding dogs in USDA licensed puppy mills than 10 years ago. I hope Ann Arbor will join in this effort by passing this ordinance and keeping our community humane.

First, I'd like to give my regards to Bob White and his years of volunteer service. He and I served on the Historic District Commission together for six years.  As someone who's developed in multiple communities and personally rezoned properties and participated in multiple comprehensive plan revision processes and has access to advice from experts in land use law, I offer this. Zoning is law, literally. The zoning code is the codification of the comprehensive plan into enforceable legal language. A rezoning is a change in the law, literally.  So do we really want to instruct the Planning Commission to recommend to change the law for hundreds of parcels to a one-size-fits-all set of rules called TC1, without them being able to recommend to make a new TC2 if good planning would suggest a different set of rules, and without being able to tweak TC1 if it would be problematic planning to apply it as-is to multiple transit corridors, each with different characteristics?  I don't think that is a wise direction, nor do I think it meets the intent of the Michigan Zoning Enabling Act. The Michigan Zoning Enabling Act allows municipalities to have a zoning ordinance if it was based on a plan, a comprehensive plan. They go hand in hand, and the planning comes first. You make the plan, then the zoning language is the legally enforceable language to allow the plan to be executed. Yes, our comprehensive plan mentions the broad concept of transit-oriented zoning multiple times.  So transit-oriented development is consistent with the plan, but the plan lacks sufficient specificity to go straight into encoding. But that's what we're doing. An analogy would be in software development, where if you take high-level design and go straight into coding it, you end up with a mess that has to be reworked.  This proposed resolution presupposes that the Planning Commission may not determine that a new transit corridor zoning category, say TC2, be created if it would better fit the Plymouth and Washtenaw Corridors' unique characteristics. The resolution says that the TC1 set of rules must be applied. And it goes further than that. It says we must rezone hundreds of parcels to TC1 as a priority prior to making any modifications to TC1.  If TC1 doesn't fit the new corridor as well, or if we find other fixes are needed to TC1 as we learn more how applicants with properties in the first two iterations are dealing with it. We are to ignore all of that. And we must rush full steam ahead, rezoning hundreds of parcels to a flawed, one-size-fits-all set of rules. We sure are in a hurry to make amends, just prior to the comprehensive plan revision started, where there will be more public engagement  and a more robust planning process.

And I do want to express my gratitude for the recently released Community Engagement Report that was provided by Public Sector Consultants, PSCs.  I am particularly pleased to see that three key findings in the report align with Crow's values and I urge the City Council to prioritize the following. So first, funding unarmed public safety response.  from existing budget resources. And this approach really ensures that fiscal responsibility and demonstrates the city's commitment to addressing the root causes of conflict and crisis without increasing the tax burden on residents and redirecting funds from traditional law enforcement to unarmed public safety response and redirect city resources to supportive social services instead of punitive and harmful law enforcement.  This prevention rather than punishment approach to public safety can reduce the need for more costly interventions later on. The second aspect is establishing a separate number for unarmed response. And having a dedicated number for unarmed response can help streamline services, ensure appropriate response to non-emergency situations.  and alleviate the burden on the 911 system. By establishing a separate number for unarmed response, communities can ensure that mental health crises, substance abuse issues, and other nonviolent situations are addressed with the appropriate level of care and expertise. The last component is excluding police from unarmed response. And by focusing on unarmed response professionals for nonviolent situations, we can  reduce the risk of unnecessary use of force, we can enhance community trust, and encourage more effective community-based solutions. And excluding police from unarmed responses can help minimize the potential for violence or use of force. Unarmed crisis response teams comprised of mental health professionals, social workers, or community mediators, they can often handle situations  without resorting to forceful tactics. So I kind of request that the city council take these findings into consideration and move forward with releasing the RFC for unarmed response.

I'm calling in support of the coalition for re-envisioning our safety, also known as CROWS. I have read the community engagement report by public sector consultants and I'm here to urge the city council to prioritize the following three key findings in that report. Firstly,  to fund the unarmed public safety response from existing budget resources. Personally, I believe that some or all of this funding should be taken out of the existing policing budget. The city's commitment of ARPA funds to an unarmed response program is a great start, and ongoing, sustained funding from the existing police budget would be a great way to ensure this program remains robust, care-based, and accessible to all Ann Arbor residents. To me, this would demonstrate the city's commitment to addressing the root causes of conflict and crisis.  Secondly, the RFP should require the establishment of a separate number for unarmed response. A dedicated number for unarmed response can help streamline services, ensure appropriate response to non-emergency situations, and alleviate the burden on the 911 system. Third and finally, the RFP should insist on the exclusion of police from the unarmed response program.  The program should focus on unarmed professionals for non-violent situations to reduce the risk of unnecessary use of force, as well as to enhance community trust and to encourage more effective community-based solutions. By ensuring a non-police response, the unarmed response program could be safely utilized by more people while simultaneously reducing the number of calls police are responding to.  Reducing the number of police responses will alleviate the burden on Ann Arbor police while freeing up existing police funds for other safety-promoting programs in the city. I kindly request that the City Council take these findings into consideration when assessing the RFP for unarmed response and moving forward with its release. Also, while I have this opportunity to speak, I would also like to extend my wishes for a happy Pride Month to all those who are being celebrated this June.  I'd like to recognize that LGBTQ plus individuals are disproportionately affected by poverty, costlessness, criminalization, and mental health crises. This means that the LGBTQ plus community would be greatly supported by this creation of an unarmed public safety response, and especially by an RFP that incorporates the three key findings that I've mentioned earlier.

Do you think it will make any difference to our esteemed mayor here,  Mayor Taylor, would it make any difference to him? It would not make any difference to him. Would it make any difference to Ms. Ghazi here, who is on this Human Rights Commission? Would this murder of a two-year-old make any difference?  Would it make them say no military aid to Israel? I doubt that. The reason is that they have no heart and they're racist. For 20 years we've come here, we have said, stop giving billions of dollars each year to that racist state that is called Israel. They have not even talked about this resolution that we've brought to them.  Thousands of people have signed petitions. Thousands of people have protested outside of this building. They will not do it. And the reason is they are racist, and they care nothing for Ann Arbor or for people of Palestine. Do you think if they gave a rat's ass about people of Ann Arbor, they would have pushed African-American community in this city out? No. With their policies, they have done that.  We've lost the black community in this town. They've moved out because they can't afford it. They have made sure the luxury housing is up, but everyone else can go die. That is their recipe for the rest of us. These people do not represent the public. They represent those who have given them, Mr. Mayor here, $90,000 to get back into his seat.  These people are the ones who pay hundreds and thousands of dollars to his cronies who are now filled in this city council. They're sitting here and doing everything they can to please their contributors. It is not their job, after having received hundreds and thousands of dollars from their campaign contributors, to now come and serve you and me. Those of us who are sitting in this  this room and you think that they actually will do something to benefit the public, just look at what we are living in. Does Yeoman bother at all to worry about the dirty water that we drink? No. Does this bunch? They've had 60 years to fix it. Have they? No. Do we have  $15 minimum wage, after members of this council have said $15 isn't enough, we still pay our workers $7 and a change. So I'm here to say IDF has murdered a two-year-old and we want to stop military aid to Israel.

It appears that historical revisionism never rests. After distributing my address to council on April 17 to a wider audience via email and Facebook, I received a reply from Diane King of Texas. She was going to disseminate my address to her email list and cautioned me against using the word Nazi, claiming it a derogatory term.  She wrote, we abhor this term. The Germans never referred to themselves that way. It's equivalent to the other ethnic slurs that are verboten, but it's okay to disparage Germans. I already knew that the term Nazi originated from a country bumpkin reference to Germans, a slur based on the common farm boy or simpleton name, Ignaz, and the shortening of that name to Nazi.  This knowledge was supplied by Benton Bradbury's book, The Myth of German Villainy. But I did not know that national socialists never referred to themselves by that name. In my ignorance, I thought everyone used the term. I asked myself whether Diane could be correct and asked the Facebook public for evidence to counter her claim.  I wanted to be shown a reference by a German National Socialist who used the term Nazi in a correspondence or speech. I ask anyone here if they have corroborative evidence of National Socialists describing themselves as Nazis.  No one on Facebook supplied such information. One respondent, though, alerted me to an article that explained exactly what Diane was claiming. The article reports that a powerful Jewish journalist named Conrad Hayden popularized this term in the 1920s as an epithet  meant to degrade members of the National Socialist Workers' Party of Germany. Apparently, this name-calling stuck. We are left with the impression that everyone used the term because we, mistakenly, are continuing to use it.  Two takeaways. One, people in groups should be referred to as they deem fit. How would our black community react to being referred to by the N word? How would our Jewish community appreciate being called the K word? I doubt either group would appreciate it. It wouldn't be right.  Second takeaway, perhaps the successful name calling technique was yet another reason why German Jews were found in disfavor by their countrymen.

City Council Member Jen Eyre,  took money for her campaign from old friends of the Israel Defense Forces. Remember, the Israel Defense Forces have killed over 2,000 children who are Palestinian since the year  2000, roughly since I've started coming here and talking for Palestinian rights. I stood in the city council in June 2002, June of 2002, and way over a hundred times since then, demanding some kind of action by the city council to object to funding  the Israeli Defense Forces. And this city council has turned a hard, cold shoulder to that. And after 21 years, after just about exactly 21 years, this month, I think you can say a pattern has developed of racist  pure racism by the City Council against the Palestinian people. And they want you to believe that they love diversity. They want you to believe that they feel sorry that the Black Lives Matter mural was desecrated in the park.  But they sure as hell are not going to give the black community its due. They sure as hell, this city council is not going to force the University of Michigan to keep its promise of 10% black admissions. No.  At most, they might allow the black community some yellow paint in the park that says Black Lives Matter. That's really not enough. After 50 years, that's really not enough.

Some of you I have not addressed before, but many of you I have on many occasions. I'm speaking in relation to the resolution you have before you to disband the Council of the Commons. And actually, I voted against that resolution and announced a minority report.  I would say the political process has processed the people's vote out of existence. The Commons is removed from the entirety of the Central Park and Civic Center Commons.  in the resolutions and work that the Council of the Commons has put forward, they have eliminated that sense. The central idea of this, that the Commons is commonly pooled resources self-managed by the users.  This is what was demonstrated to the effect of the Nobel Prize in economics as the most effective way of organizing commonly poor resources. More effective than having the government, more effective than having a private profit corporation when the users  manage the resources, they are better managed, more productively, and more happily. And besides just taking out that idea, they also have reduced the notion to a plaza, not a Central Park, and the entirety of the idea of a civic center is removed, a ceremonial meeting place, a visitor center for people coming to Ann Arbor.  A place where there's a reference to the historic history and via region and location of Ann Arbor and its history. The sense that there is a food system here producing a cafe that honors the food producers of this area. The civic  a performance space appropriate for like the comic opera, one of the first signers of the petition for the commons. A preference  A way to have a meeting place and a connection place for social services. That's another function of a civic center, removed from the consideration. And a place for the fostering of a culture of peace and nonviolence, which is one of the recommendations that came out of the task force. And a place for the volunteers who do the comments to work together. All this is eliminated. I guess I'm done."}, {"start": 3186.088, "end": 3198.016, "speaker": "SPEAKER_16", "text": "Thank you.

Greetings, Mr. Mayor and Ann Arbor City Council. It's kind of hard to follow Holocaust deniers and Jew haters, but I'm going to give it a go.  On item DC2, I wanted to express my strong support in favor of this resolution, which directs the Planning Commission and staff to prioritize Plymouth and Washtenaw Avenues to be rezoned under TC1. My opinion is that this action is long overdue.  and that any further modification or revisions to TC1 zoning can take place later. I urge City Council to vote yes tonight. On item DC3, I believe, Ivan, it is telling that the Council of the Commons voted to dissolve itself during their last meeting.  as I find it indicative of the ineffectiveness and dysfunction of the COTC as a body and of the process overall. In my opinion, once the Center of the City project is put into the hands of the Parks Advisory Committee, the city should waste no more time, no more money, and put no more effort beyond  the anticipated request for proposals for a design of a quote-unquote park or quote-unquote civic commons for which the center of the city could not even come to a consensus or a definition of. And  That the city council do the right thing by putting the library lot back on the ballot with a decisive proposal that would settle once and for all. Firstly, that we get a project that can be supported.  by more than a bare majority of voters. Secondly, something precise and explicit in terms of funding for such a project, whether it be another millage or some other funding mechanism. Thirdly, that if jurisdiction is to be under- 30 seconds.  or some other explicitly defined entity. That needs to be done. And fourthly, I think city council needs to revise the city charter once again under a valid proposal to be able to once again sell the air rights  for the library lot to a developer and include provisions for affordable or workforce housing. In addition, I'm encouraged by the city's efforts to improve Liberty Plaza, which, from my observations of COTC meetings, was neglected and pretty much an afterthought.

My name is Jean Leverage and I'm a clinical social worker who lives at 912 Pomona in Ward 5, not far from the stadium.  TC1 area, the stadium area. I currently am a clinical social worker and I serve as an at-large member of the city's Housing and Human Services Advisory Board. And I'm really just here to say three quick things because it's been  quite a tough week. And if I made something really complicated, I probably wouldn't have come to talk at all. So the first thing I want to say is I want to thank our city staff and city council for doing such good work. And I want to say, let's get moving on TC1 on the TC1 rezoning of Plymouth and Washtenaw now so that we don't keep getting these requests for single story, single use  buildings and drive-thrus, right? We don't want to have to undo stuff. Let's make it easier rather than harder to build different kinds of housing, diverse housing, to meet the needs of our economically and socially diverse community, right? Not everybody wants the same kind of house and a whole lot of people end up not living in Ann Arbor at all and then commuting in and having, you know, to add to the greenhouse gases.  Secondly, it's a really exciting agenda that you have tonight. I want to also weigh in on the cross proposal. I strongly support funding an unarmed non-police public safety response with a dedicated separate phone number and to create that from existing budget resources. And I think that that's really important because when people are in distress,  It's really great if we can have people who are trained in conflict management who are just community members to help. Thirdly, I think it's really past time to dissolve the Council of the Commons, which really was such a heartbreaking, honestly, waste of resources and time, so that we can finally  really begin to activate that parking lot that we have downtown with a public square and mixed-use buildings that have eyes on the plaza and that are bringing the public in. And that might look like affordable housing at this point. It might be affordable housing with mixed-use on the ground floor, but I really am excited that we're moving forward and I do hope that we  bring the city charter to a ballot in the very near future so that we can move forward with that.

I'm so grateful to Mayor Taylor, our LGBTQ plus staff and community leaders who came tonight to celebrate Pride Month with our proclamation this evening. Last month, I attended a ceremonial bill signing with Governor Whitmer to expand the Elliott Larson Civil Rights Act. Representative Brabeck, who represents Ann Arbor, recently reintroduced legislation to ban the dangerous and discredited practice of conversion therapy.  And while here in Michigan under Democratic leadership, we have much to celebrate in support of equality and LGBTQ rights. In Republican-controlled states, LGBTQ residents are under relentless attack. More than 400 anti-LGBTQ bills have been introduced across the country already this year.  Instead of focusing on real issues like housing affordability, reducing gun violence, improving public education, expanding access to mental health support, or improving our infrastructure, Republican politicians are relentlessly attacking their LGBTQ constituents, their own neighbors, their friends and family members, and even their colleagues to score cheap political points with the most extreme hateful fringes of the right wing base. This now includes a ridiculous war on Mickey Mouse led by a future footnote in the 2024 Republican presidential primary.  Many of these discriminatory bills specifically target transgender children, including countless bills threatening to limit access to life-saving care and, through the attacks themselves, endangering their lives. These bills are dangerous, discriminatory, and seek to erase our community. Now is not the time for us to back down or to take our recent wins for granted.  And so with that in mind, I also invite our community to join in a celebration of pride or a summer of pride activities, both in celebration and in a call to activism. Locally, Pride Month kicked off in Ypsilanti on Friday and will continue through at least August 5th when Ann Arbor Pride will be celebrated on Main Street this year.  You can learn more and get involved at Ann Arbor Pride, and I also encourage you to get involved through countless community organizations like the Jim Toy Community Center, Stand With Trans, Victory Fund, the Human Rights Campaign, and so many others doing good work to support our LGBTQ community.

It was especially poignant, I think, because I took a second to  detour to the future side of the Catherine Street development, just walked through the park one more time, and I don't know, I thought that that was a poignant moment here. I also wanted to mention last week I attended the annual meeting of the Jewish Federation, saw a lot of Ward 2 constituents, and I also heard a speech from former Congressmember Brenda Lawrence, a black woman who represented a district  that included the highest Jewish population by percentage in the house. In her post-career, she has chosen to become president of Share the Honey, a non-profit dedicated to raising awareness of the shared history and collaboration of the black and Jewish people in America. As she said, we can't compare scars, the Jewish experience of the Holocaust and the black experience of slavery, but we can share empathy.  You know, it's a season of intersectionality in June as well, because this Pride Month, I'm thinking of the LGBTQ+, friends, classmates, teachers, priests, and colleagues old and new, whose friendship, support, and mentorship have made me into the man I am today. I knew when I ran for office that public comment is a place for community members to exercise their First Amendment rights, and all that  that has sadly come to entail in Ann Arbor specifically. But I would point out, regularly hearing Holocaust denial and hate speech in this chamber while trying to serve my community is the hardest part of this job, and I believe it actively discourages members of  any racial or religious minority from sitting in my chair and those that wish to seek the honor and privilege of representing Ann Arborites.

I just, I want to make a brief comment about false information regarding this contract that was published by a former council member.  former council member from the fourth ward, Elizabeth Nelson. Although she lost her last election fairly indecisively, she has continued to push conspiracy theories through her blog and newsletter and has worked to sow distrust in our local democratic systems. So while I would prefer not to give these rantings air, enough of my constituents see them that I feel ethically bound to correct the record.  Regarding this particular contract, she noted that the contractor's experience modification rating for the year 21-22 had changed in its most recent proposal as compared to previous ones. Now, for the uninitiated, the EMR is a metric used by insurance carriers to gauge both the past cost of a worker's compensation claims as well as the future probability of additional claim costs. It should be noted that this system is based on self-reporting.  And it is sometimes the case that the contractor's higher EMR reflects a willingness to report claims rather than actually having an unsafe working environment and vice versa. However, in this case, the former council member asserted incorrectly that an EMR for a given year can never change. And finally, she insinuated that the contractor's insurance company must have falsified the document. This is reprehensible.  It's also potentially libelous, but I'll leave that to the attorneys. What I will say is that when I noticed the change, I checked it out, and I found a perfectly reasonable explanation. The contractor had an outstanding workers' comp claim for that particular calendar year that was recently closed, and they were found to not be at fault. Therefore, their EMR for that year has now decreased.  This is very unfortunately not the first time this former council member has attacked this particular contractor. It's very curious. I'm calling on Nelson to post and send out a retraction and an apology to both Bailey Excavating and Barker Weber Insurance Agency. I do hope that readers of her blog and newsletter will take note.

Unless I am mistaken."}, {"start": 4987.008, "end": 5342.748, "speaker": "SPEAKER_41", "text": "I believe that I do, unless the council no longer needs it. Sorry. Hi, everybody. Good evening. Introduce. So we received a number of questions from council members over the last day. Before I get into addressing a lot of those questions, I want to introduce two members of the research team who are here with us tonight, Dr. Kristen Seafelt and Trevor McTowell. And we also have two members here virtually who will  we get to answering some of the questions, I'll have them introduced. But I do want to start off and talk briefly, knock out a number of the questions with some general remarks discussing the program. And I'll start by talking generally about why, who, and what. Should the council approve this contract tonight, Ann Arbor will join a nationwide community of cities that support guaranteed income and universal basic income pilots.  We wanted to do something different. As a matter of fact, when we issued our RFP for this project, we asked respondents to give us a novel approach. And there are a couple of important reasons why. This is a pilot. It's a time-limited program. It will, at some point, come to an end. And while our main objective is to provide important support to the families who will be enrolled in the program,  It was also important for us to do something of value that could be left behind to cities who want to do this again, either have a second program or start one on their own. So we wanted to have a piece of social science that was quality.  that reflected the nature of poverty in this community and potentially in other communities, and that people could use to draw on to build important lessons and do something different and push the envelope on universal basic income. And so the response that we got from Poverty Solutions met that call. And what they asked for, excuse me, what they called for,  was a pilot that wanted to examine the nature of universal basic income and how it can affect entrepreneurship, but a certain kind of entrepreneurship. And I want to get into talking a little bit about that.  This is a program that is targeted at low and moderate income households. That's the number one criteria. And among these households, people who are doing everything they can to get by, there is entrepreneurship that happens. It could be gig work or side hustles. In the household I grew up in, my mom was a stay-at-home mom, but she made wedding cakes out of our kitchen. And that was a really important source of income for our family.  And so there are communities, or excuse me, families like that all across our community in the city of Ann Arbor. And it's an important question to ask because in cities all across the country, when we see guaranteed income programs, there are always critics who step up and say giving away free money for nothing will cause people not to work.  Now on pilot and pilot across the country, I think we're able to show that that's not the case. But it's really important to understand why. And it's really important to try to find ways to design these programs in the future, so that they can produce better health and wellness outcomes for families and produce better economic outcomes for them as well.  And so we want to enroll families that are, or individuals who are from low and moderate income households who are engaged in that kind of low-level entrepreneurship. And we want to ask, what does this program do to that activity? Does it make them step it up and to do more? Does it make them say, you know what, I'm good, I'm going to take this money and invest it somewhere else?  Or does it make them say, you know what, I work hard enough as it is and I don't want to do this anymore and stop the activity entirely. And in all three of those cases, and I suspect we will find all three of those cases, does that impact their health and wellness? And how does it do that?  That's what we want to answer and that's what we want to find out through this program. So we received a lot of questions about who will be eligible. Like I said, the number one criteria is low and moderate income households. There will be an amendment offered tonight that requires those households to be City of Ann Arbor residents, members of those households to be City of Ann Arbor residents.  But that's the top line criteria. There's not a whole lot of detail other than that. And I think it's really important to understand why for that reason as well. The research and administration team working with the city will be partnering with service providers and organizations from across the city who deal with low and moderate income households and people in those households. And we will be constructing those criteria in conversation with them. Time and again,  we prove all the time that we can probably sit in City Hall and put together program criteria that meet, I don't know, 70, 80% of need, but you get over that hump to really fantastic programs by engaging people in the community and having conversations with them to understand what their needs are. So you're not gonna see really detailed eligibility and enrollment criteria within the RFP because that comes after the contract is approved and in conversation with community members.  The last thing is, what do we hope to achieve?  It's two important goals. Like I said, we want to provide support to households and families in Ann Arbor who need it, who are adversely affected by the pandemic. But we also want to leave something lasting and something that can be handed to the next city so that when they do their guaranteed income pilot, they're starting a little bit further along than we are. And with a little more clarity, and hopefully they can push the envelope on this movement a little further.  So with that being said, we have some specific questions, and I will let Dr. Seefeld introduce herself, and we'll go through and answer some of the specific questions that we received from council."}, {"start": 5343.857, "end": 5493.212, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "text": "Good evening council members on Mayor Taylor. I'm Kristen Seafelt. I'm a Ward 1 resident and I'm really pleased that Poverty Solutions as well as the School of Social Work at U of M has the opportunity to partner with the city as well as other  other community agencies in the city on this endeavor. And I would stress that this really is a collaborative effort. The folks who know best are the folks who are on the front lines. And it's really very important to us that we do this collaboratively. So I really welcome all of the questions that folks might have. Just want me to run.  Sure, let's run through them. OK. So Council Member Ghazi, Edwin, you had asked about some of the public education efforts that we would undertake, particularly to help folks understand what might be complicated scenarios. We imagine a really multi-pronged approach to community outreach and education.  everything from, you know, websites, and we have a history of doing websites to explain things like the stimulus payments. So we did a lot of outreach around getting people to get their stimulus payments and explain the process and walk them through  Likewise with the child tax credit, we ran a website to do that. Going to community events and just sitting down and talking to folks, one-on-one or in larger presentations. We'll work with various organizations in the community to help develop materials that really are tailored to the populations they work with, whether that is in different languages or  So just sort of pitch to what the agency itself  does. We have proposed at least two larger community forums to be held in places that are accessible to folks, perhaps churches, perhaps community centers, Washtenaw Community College, places that are on bus routes, where we could just have an opportunity for folks to just learn more about the pilot and have their questions answered."}, {"start": 5494.643, "end": 5503.026, "speaker": "SPEAKER_41", "text": "But I'll just add that we'll also be using the city's full communications capability to communicate with the public."}, {"start": 5503.026, "end": 5555.315, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "text": "You'd also asked about why business owners, entrepreneurs, we're calling them low-level entrepreneurs,  John answered a lot of that.

And this is the group that emerged from those discussions. It was a repeated theme. So in addition to wanting to really take seriously the request for a novel proposal, this was really community driven as well."}, {"start": 5555.315, "end": 5555.615, "speaker": "SPEAKER_19", "text": "Thank you."}, {"start": 5557.57, "end": 6388.944, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "text": "Council Member Briggs, you had asked about servicing folks beyond the Ann Arbor community.  In the addendum to the RFP, it said that we could include people in the larger community. So we responded accordingly. And in part because we had thought about, what about the folks who can't live here but who want to live here because of housing costs, or who used to live here but moved out and didn't? But that's certainly something that I understand the concern.  a grant that was made to the city of Ann Arbor, but that was sort of our rationale in that regard. We recognize, too, in regards to your question about who is our population, there really isn't a standard definition for  a micro-business, a small business, a low-level entrepreneur. And so one of the, I think, two main agenda items for our kickoff meeting once this gets launched, which will be held in collaboration with community partners who both were named in the proposal, but also others who we've talked to subsequently, is to really kind of come up with a working definition for who  who are the folks that we want to reach out to, but again, we want to do that in collaboration with the folks who know the best, and so that we're not imposing a definition that's not going to work. You'd also asked about  the sample size. So the addendum to the proposal talked about a group of 25 individuals. Those are folks who we'll do qualitative interviews with. The sample itself is 100 members who get the guaranteed income payment, 100 who serve as the control group. The addendum was just to add in an additional  And I also thank you for pointing out an error in our proposal around issues of attrition and retention. We should have said that we are assuming an 80% retention rate of those folks, not an 80% attrition rate. Yes, that would not work. So thank you for calling our attention to that.  Councilmember Watson, you'd asked about Friends Indeed who are indeed based in Ypsilanti.  They do serve the larger Washtenaw County. We don't also view them as sort of the sole source of recruitment. We don't really view any organization that we would work with as the place where we're going to recruit all of our participants. We plan to cast a wide net. And we ourselves plan to do a lot of just feet on the ground and going to events and not placing the burden entirely on the nonprofit sector to do the recruiting.  into the program. We see them as both being very helpful and being able to, you know, help us, you know, with things like providing feedback on our surveys, feedback on reports, things like this. You'd also asked about, like, well, why not just give a, you know, one-time upfront cash infusion.  We didn't want to necessarily say, because the spirit of guaranteed income really is, there aren't strings attached to what you do with the money. We didn't want to say, oh, here's some money to invest in your business. That's a slightly different model. So we're talking amongst our team. And something that we'd want to talk with the community about is, do we do  Monthly payments that are of the same amount, do we front load the payments and taper off things like that? But those are some of the design decisions that we're considering right now.  And then Council Member Harrison, you'd asked a number of questions. One about how we decided about our potential collaborators, and whether we put out a call for support. We lacked time to do that with the turnaround time in getting the proposal in. So we did a snowball approach to people suggesting us, you should talk to this group, or you should talk to this group, as well as drawing upon our own community connections.  And again, the focus of our outreach effort at that point was really to identify a population to work with, not necessarily a partner. So once we sort of landed on a population, then we selected to name Friends Indeed as our community partner because of just all the work that they do with their Circles program in this area.  You named a number of different very important organizations in the community. We have reached out or will reach out to most of them. The RFP, as we read it, specified one partner to be named. But I've been in pretty regular, almost weekly, communications with the Ann Arbor Community Foundation, for example, about bringing them into the mix.  We've talked to other organizations as well and envision continuing to do that.  You also noted in the addendum, there was a shift in the budget where the payment amount went down slightly. In consultation with the team here at the city, we decided to add an additional round of qualitative interviews to help better inform the design of the study going forward.  And but keeping the total amount of money the same. So the cost of administering the payments, and we are going to contract with a third party to send out the payments, that's fixed. And we are pretty bare bones in terms of our staff effort. And that's along with the university contributing about $170,000.  in costs as well. So we took the payments down, as you know, about $2. So that was done to really bolster the research. While we very much would love it if every person in the pilot participated in every phase of the research,  You know, that is up to the individual. We would not force anybody to complete a survey or an interview, and their payments aren't, their guaranteed income payments aren't contingent upon that. We would not disenroll anybody if they missed a survey. That's, you know, that would not be within the spirit of the program.  You'd also asked about the role that Circles and Friends, indeed, could play in helping us to locate potential participants. The Circles program really does have, as its model, the goal of helping  folks who are lower income start their own businesses and that really does resonate with what we're proposing. They've been running their Circles program that does this for about five years and they're currently in their sixth cohort.  They're definitely a group that we want to be able to tap into their network, but we also are going to collaborate with just a wide variety of stakeholders and service providers within the community, and particularly groups that, you know,  would help us locate folks who are not necessarily going to be easy for a U of M researcher to reach out to. I mean, we really are committed to developing relationships with trusted members of different communities in order to help bridge some of that gap and really to help the success of the project as a whole.  And that would include organizations that work with folks who have justice system involvement. And I appreciate that you raised that group up. For that group, certainly this kind of entrepreneurial activity is really important if folks are locked out of labor market activities otherwise. So Poverty Solutions is just starting a collaboration project with A Brighter Way.  Trevor, my colleague, is on the Housing Subcommittee of Washtenaw County Reentry Stakeholders Initiative. So we have some connections to get us started on the pilot. Another really important piece to this whole pilot is making sure that people are not worse off  for participating in it, meaning that they don't lose benefits they're receiving. So the good news is we've been in conversations with the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, and we're in the process of submitting an application for a waiver to make sure that SNAP, Medicaid, TANF, and a couple other benefit programs, that the guaranteed income payment won't count toward their eligibility for those programs.  And we're starting conversations to make sure that that would also be the case with any housing assistance folks would get. So we are trying to make sure that no one is worse off for that. And we want to also, you know,  So we'll make sure that we really have conversations about that, because that is one of the most important aspects of communication around the Guaranteed Income Project. It also could be, of course, that folks may be reluctant to come forward, not just because of fear of losing benefits, but also of tax implications or other fears about, like, is this information going to get out?  to third parties who could use it against them. So going through our institutional review board process certainly provides a layer of protection of confidentiality. We also just started talking about, and I believe we are going to go forward with securing a certificate of confidentiality from the federal government through NIH.  and that will protect the privacy of folks in the research study. It prohibits us from disclosing information about them except under a really, really limited set of circumstances. And again, we would try to convey that to participants so that they know we take their confidentiality really, really seriously. Finally, I would just say,  Thinking about, again, getting back to sort of the who and the why of this proposal that we put together. Again, we don't want to mandate that anyone use the guaranteed income payment for any particular purpose. If they want to use it toward their business, terrific. If not, that's great too. That said,  Nearly all, if not all of the other guaranteed income pilots operating throughout the nation, focus on a particular population. So I have a long list, and I can share it with you, but that includes fathers in parenting programs, female identifying care professionals, working adults, people enrolled in a community college program. So we're sort of using the low-level entrepreneur framework as a way to,  kind of select into including who's the group that will get the payment. But there's no stipulation that anyone has to keep working or on their side business in order to continue receiving the payment at all. So I sped through that really quickly. So I hope I addressed some of the questions you have. But I'm happy to answer anything further."}, {"start": 6388.944, "end": 6401.924, "speaker": "SPEAKER_16", "text": "Super.

I'd like to thank Mr. Fournier and the research group at Poverty Solutions for your willingness to engage in a conversation on this, the thoughtfulness of the proposal, the continued conversations, some on quite short notice with council members here. And I do want to highlight that you've really taken time to answer a lot of my questions, and I appreciate the answers you gave.  In the second portion of my question, the one where I talked about upfront grants versus income, I think that arose from perhaps a misunderstanding of the goals of this project that were cleared up for me by some answers that were given here. And that question was basically, if we are looking to  perhaps stimulate small business in the city of Ann Arbor, minority-owned, low-income small businesses. I didn't know if that would be something that we would compare perhaps to the county's, you know, small business growth activator, which is providing $5,000 grants to, you know, low-income households with 80% that where the household income is 80% less than 80% of the  area median income in Washtenaw County, and the businesses must operate within Washtenaw County, and the businesses would have fewer than five employees. Some of these are definitions of the, you know, county definitions that you're at different points in your proposal you're using. But I just wanted to talk about the fact that it was Fournier, DCA Fournier, who  clarified that this isn't really a study about businesses or business growth or improvement. It's a study about health outcomes through a lens of people who we feel to be the most, a vulnerable population that we can target. Can you talk a little bit, Mr. Fournier and the colleagues at Poverty Solutions, could you talk a little bit about  why it's easier and cheaper to get this money out through this pilot than it would be to get it out through a universal basic income pilot where we might have to work with a private payment provider or another entity to judge eligibility and all that?"}, {"start": 6554.5, "end": 6699.483, "speaker": "SPEAKER_41", "text": "So a couple different ideas there I'll touch on is that when we started formulating this program, the first thing we did, we looked at the kind of programs that other cities were moving forward. And there's kind of a bumper crop of companies and nonprofit organizations that have come to fruition nationally that will administer these programs on your behalf. But many of them are very expensive.  And they'll come just right up front. They'll tell you, we take 20 to 25% up front as an administration fee. We'll enroll the people. We'll cut the checks. And when we ask follow-up questions like, well, what kind of follow-up do you do to see if these programs were beneficial and how the participants felt about it and whether we achieved outcomes? They say, oh, yeah, we do a survey. We'll email out a survey.  And the social scientists on council are all kind of laughing now because that's not really research, right? Now, they may be producing information that's useful and that's interesting for their funders or for some of their other participants, but it is not the type of information that is peer-reviewable and valuable and that can be passed on from one person to the next in a reliable way. And so when we started internally, we started thinking about, well, how do we move forward from here?  This is Ann Arbor. We have one of the finest research institutions on the planet right here. And the population of the city that corresponds with that. We have a highly educated community here, a lot of PhDs. What should we do? And we thought, the people who should be administering this are people who have a really good financial administration framework, who know how to handle federal grant funds, and who can conduct really top notch research. We thought, we need a research partner.  who can do the administration for us and also give us something of quality at the end. And that's what structured the RFP. And what we ended up getting from our friends at Poverty Solutions and the University of Michigan is a proposal that on the whole is going to cost us less money in administration and is going to give us something of  exponentially greater value. And so that really kind of led to the decisions to kind of structure a really high value research proposal around this. Does that answer your question? Yes."}, {"start": 6699.483, "end": 6703.324, "speaker": "SPEAKER_39", "text": "Thank you.

The question I had earlier for Mr. Fournier, I guess, or my concern,  is I guess I'm wondering how are individuals, how are you guys gonna ask individuals to self-report? And the reason, the follow-up to that question is that when you have low-income, you know, folks that are very low-income or poverty-stricken individuals that are engaging in side hustles or  small business baking cakes and selling them out of their home. Many of these individuals do have benefits, as you discussed earlier, Medicaid, SNAP benefits, Section 8, and  if there's a very low threshold, as you know, to when that individual can lose their benefits. I believe $2,000 even in a bank account. So these individuals who are cutting hair or doing hair in their basement, they often are not  you know, they're not reporting this, this income.

You know, we also, you know, I think we can't stress enough to potential participants, you know, that benefits won't be affected. You know, and that's communicating that will be really key.

We're trying to do something that will impact community, have a strong impact in community, and can make a statement that we've actually responded to emerging needs.  I hear from Green Baxter court residents, I hear this from the back to school celebration at Bryan Community Center, and more recently I hear this question from folks who were responding to the eviction crisis back in April when we rebudgeted money to respond to that.  We know the pandemic has impacted community members differently across race and income. We know these inequities existed before the pandemic. There was a 2018 county health study that Poverty Solutions also helped pull together where differences in social, economic, and physical environments across the county explain the differences in quality of life and health.  We know that black babies in the county are twice as likely to be born at low birth weight as white babies. We know that there are six times more likely to grow up in poverty. Hispanic children are almost three times more likely to grow up in poverty compared to white children. And we know there's a nine-year life expectancy difference between Ann Arbor's 48104 zip code compared to Ypsilanti's 48198 zip code.  And I can't help reflect on a comment that I heard throughout the pandemic from a community leader who would say that she lost over 30 black community members and family members during the pandemic. And she asked me, what are electives going to do to respond to that? How many funerals did you go to? Do you know children are missing their grandparents, other extended family members? And my hope was that in pushing for this effort,  It would show that we have this willingness to not only fund and partner in this project to address harms and bring some love, but also bring some level of recovery and healing.

The goal of using those things  was to make it a little easier to ascertain who might be eligible. For example, I know that a lot of people might not know exactly, you know, if they've applied for, you know, have they filled out exactly the correct applications, but a lot of people know if their children are eligible for free or reduced price lunch, and that's just an easy touch point.

So the way this came about is in November, a woman came to my first constituent coffee hour asking me if I'd consider an ordinance to stop pet sales in stores. I didn't know a lot about this issue, but I learned through my conversations with her and through the director of the Huron Valley Humane Society that there's no oversight at the state or federal level on pet breeding conditions, as we heard from public commenter earlier.  This means that a significant number of puppies, kittens, and rabbits sold at pet shops are sourced from large-scale commercial breeding facilities, also known as puppy mills, kitten mills, rabbit mills, et cetera. They don't adequately provide for the health and the welfare of animals. According to the Humane Society of the United States, it's estimated that 10,000 puppy mills produce more than 2.4 million puppies per year in the United States.  and that most pet shop dogs, cats, and rabbits come from these mills. The documented abuses include overbreeding, inbreeding, minimal to non-existent veterinary care, lack of adequate and nutritious food, water, and shelter, lack of socialization, lack of adequate space, and lack of adequate exercise.  So this ordinance, if passed, would mean that no pet store in Ann Arbor shall offer for sale or dispose of dogs, cats, ferrets, rabbits, long-lived birds, or large reptiles. It's important to note that there's currently no stores selling pets in Ann Arbor. So what this ordinance really does is ensure that no pet store is ever, you know, ever does this practice in the future.  We modeled this ordinance on Washtenaw County's 2019 resolution that provided municipalities in Washtenaw County with a model pet acquisition ordinance. Nothing in this ordinance prevents a pet store from providing space or care to the rescued animals, and it also does not affect a consumer's ability to obtain  One of these pets directly from a breed specific rescue organization.

So this is an instruction  That change is something that council had asked for a few months ago. We had asked for tweaking to TC1 before it came to Plymouth and Washtenaw. Tonight we've heard the concern that one size zoning does not fit all and that we need to modify TC1 before applying it further. The question before us is not does one size fit all or not. The question is, is TC1 better than the current zoning? And the answer is yes.  Current zoning dates back decades. It permits outmoded land uses, such as development that is single story, inclusive of high ratios of automobile parking, and physically arranged in a manner that does not promote multimodal transportation options to or between sites. The TC1 zoning district restricts the creation or expansion of that kind of outmoded development, which is at odds with this city's initiatives towards  reducing carbon emissions by getting people out of their cars and onto their feet or their bicycles or into buses. There is an urgency to protect  both of the corridors that I've spoken about from the creation or expansion of outmoded development. But that does not mean that there will be hastiness in moving forward with the rezoning process. There will be public engagement before any proposal comes to Planning Commission. There will be public hearings at Planning Commission.  and public hearings at council. All of these meetings will be fully noticed to neighbors and will be publicized to the community at large. There is an urgency to rezone, but that does not mean that once the zoning is in place, we will see an immediate result. Zoning is a long game. I've said this before.

I wanted to just call out, first of all, my gratitude and thanks to my Council of the Commons colleagues. I had actually requested to be appointed before I was elected to Council of the Commons, so I have been part of that group since its inception.  Basically, what this resolution states is that the Council of the Commons group has completed thorough research into other communities' central plazas, engaged with businesses, residents, and stakeholders, considered to be center-of-the-city block partners to receive feedback and direction, has coordinated with the Parks Advisory Committee on activities and ideas, and provided ample information on which the evaluation of the feasibility and vitality of a central plaza on the center-of-the-city site can be conducted by city staff and city council.  In short, a lot of hard work has gone into getting an analysis done as to what is possible and what other communities do with their center of the city initiatives in terms of a common place for folks to gather in the center of their towns. And a lot of work has gone into this. So I know that it's easy to say, you know, there isn't a lot to show for it.  I would disagree that a lot of research has been done. I know that people actually visited other communities, went and talked to the Council of Commons members, did go to other communities, did, you know, so much work on this. And it is to the point now where the conversations around those tables have devolved to a point of  lack of utility. So it is appropriate to disband that group and to refer these activities as indicated to the Parks Advisory Committee, which is, it is part of a park, it is designated as a park, and that is the appropriate use for that committee's time. So again, I want to thank my Council of the Commons colleagues for the work that they had done.  And also want to recognize, as was mentioned earlier, that the Council of the Commons itself did vote to dissolve itself in recognition of creating a roadmap that the city could then take and consider for future implementation and use.  Just in closing if you want to use that space nothing right now prohibits you from using that space Although there isn't built infrastructure there right now. You can use that park You just have to get a permit same as any other park and you're welcome to activate it for spaces.

We learned, we've had this new system in place for a little while here and have learned kind of how it works and folks have gotten used to it.

I have been working with our, our attorney, the housing commission's attorney on development projects, as well as our bond council to figure out what type of bonds work the best for different types of projects. And what we've been finding is there's all types of ways to issue bonds, both tax exempt,  and not tax exempt municipal bonds, bonds that require the state to use part of their bond cap to pass it down to us to utilize it. And all roads have been a dead end so far. And so we may end up having only one path that we can take if we also are utilizing what's called 9% low income housing tax credits, and that potential path  might only allow us to work directly with the city of Ann Arbor with their bond authority. It's very complicated. I'm happy to take questions.

Dehoney and a couple of council members in advance of our budget our budget discussions and Mr. Dehoney basically said that's an interesting question. You need to ask me to ask that question and  And it really follows, and then also, probably a good idea to talk to Jennifer Hall. And I was really heartened in those follow-up discussions to learn more about the  what the market is like, what the market conditions are like. Not heartened to hear it, actually not thrilled to hear how difficult it is to build multifamily housing right now given those market conditions. Market Watch had an article back in April saying that on how housing starts had declined in March and that apartment construction had cooled. And what housing starts is is basically the number of homes that would be built over an entire year if construction took place at the same rate every month.  So this resolution echoes this economic outlook. It references the National Association of Home Builders report that combined single family and multifamily housing starts were 29.5% lower in the Midwest. And that's due to increased construction and transportation energy costs.  So ultimately, that leaves fewer options for buyers and renters. And how that impacts affordable housing can be really drastic. Because unlike market rate housing, which is funded with different capital stacks, they can address increasing costs by increasing rents. But with our projects, there's less flexibility when it's financed by HUD-backed loans.  So even if projects which are financed with LIHTC credits, there are developers across the country saying it's no longer financially viable to construct affordable housing. So we're not immune to these market conditions. My worry was that we need to start addressing our affordable housing crisis more quickly. And I'm hoping that this will enable us to build more housing.  We have 300 in the pipeline, but we're still so far from the 2,787 that we had dedicated ourselves to back in 2015. So these discussions have been fruitful. I've learned a lot. I wish we had more money more quickly for this work.  And I'm hoping that we can address this, similar to how we had addressed street repair when Mr. DeHoney had proposed bonding out for that work last year. So I'm hoping for good results.

Leveraging bond financing is a crucial tool to advance our commitment to affordable housing in Ann Arbor. This is not just an economic matter, it's equitable access to housing in Ann Arbor. Let's be clear, housing affordability is not a privilege, it is a right. An equitable city is where  is one where everyone, regardless of income, has access to affordable housing. For the most part, our city has always been prosperous, yet a significant portion of our citizens are denied access to affordable housing. Housing insecurity in the midst of wealth is not equity. Bond financing presents us with an innovative, promising solution that has the potential to act as a catalyst, transforming aspirations for housing equity into tangible realities.  We have the resources in the form of our city's affordable housing millage, generating around $6.5 million annually. It's time we put these resources to work more effectively and more quickly. Our millage revenue could be the key to unlock a brighter, more equitable future for our city. When we adopted Washtenaw County's housing pledge in 2020, we made a promise. We acknowledged housing is a fundamental human right.  and we took responsibility for making this right a reality for our citizens. Today we have the chance to prove that this was more than just words. Let's turn our pledge into action. Remember our goal just isn't creating affordable housing. It's about creating an equitable community where everyone can thrive. Affordable housing isn't just about shelter. It's about equal opportunity. It's about social justice.

Earlier today we talked about how we're going to use zoning to try to influence private sector development. Here we're talking about the public sector development that we can do on most  Most proximally on city-owned lots and what we know is that in both the private and the public sector Costs are just increasing. They're not going down. So using the money that we Have and anticipate to have through our millage using that money quicker And getting it up front rather than waiting for market as market costs contracting costs just continue go up may allow us to build more and  the to clarify just the point on the amendment here um it was offered to us by uh Mr. McDonald in the attorney's office what it does is it um clarifies that this is stuff that was already happening this is work that Mrs. Hall was already doing and because we're going to be talking next week about um  grants that we are making, the City of Ann Arbor is making to the Housing Commission. This is clarifying that this is ongoing, looking at another angle, which is the bond financing. Mrs. Hall, I would wonder, could you talk a little bit about the unique conditions in Ann Arbor and how the fact that the area median income continuing to increase just makes everything harder from the Housing Commission's angle in terms of getting things built and also  financing specific to the Ann Arbor market?"}, {"start": 10868.969, "end": 11158.452, "speaker": "SPEAKER_38", "text": "That's a very long answer. I'd like to proceed that by saying thanks to Councilmember Song as well because I thought I was just answering questions so I had not prepared any kind of presentation so I appreciate your background. It's interesting because the $124,000 area median income  It does reflect the actual conditions of the marketplace in the competition for housing, but it also under-reflects it because of, and I've talked about this many times in the past, because of students who appear to be in poverty and low income.  may or may not be from a, you know, from their family situation, whether they came from poverty or not, or low income or not. So it's actually under representing what's happening in the marketplace. And even in particularly, not just even, but particularly low income students are having a really hard time even finding housing in Ann Arbor now as well. And we're hearing both anecdotal and real stories about our voucher tenants getting displaced from  the city of Ypsi and Ypsi Township and Pittsfield Township because of the students that are continuing to get pushed farther and farther outside the community. In an odd way, the $124,000 increase in median income is attractive to, maybe this is an odd, but to for-profit developers because the area median income doesn't  exactly ride the same way up and down over time as rents, but it's pretty close. So as income goes up, rent goes up. And so the various programs that we have to apply to put our capital stack together, the median incomes and the rents are much higher than most communities. So in some senses,  We're an attractive community to build affordable housing. If that's the type of housing that you do because you can charge more rent for like a 60% AMI household than you could in other communities. The problem is that our development costs are also higher on the front end. And so you're constantly  throwing the needle between figuring out how to keep your housing costs at an affordable, manageable level on the development side. Right now, our project on Catherine is running about $478,000 a unit, which exceeds what the state MSHDA limitations are for per unit cost. And so we've already gotten a waiver from them to allow us to exceed their per unit cost.  Um, but on the backside, you can also have higher rents, but that is from a for-profit affordable housing developer perspective. When you're coming from a perspective of a nonprofit mission driven, uh, housing developer, even though we could charge $1,600 a month in rent, um, to reach that 60% AMI or 50% AMI household.  that is not the rent that we desire to charge when unless we have a rent subsidy. And so the type of financing that we put together doesn't provide a rent subsidy. The only way you can do that is with a with a some kind of an actual voucher type program. So we will have units that we bring online  that will be affordable, but we are not pricing them at the maximum amount that can be generated, because we know that our households that we're targeting in the community, even at 60% AMI, $1,600 a month is a lot. So we're trying to get units priced at more in the $800 to $1,000 range, which still feels very high. So there's a lot of different factors. The market is  constantly changing you know record low interest a couple years ago and now we're it's definitely not record high interest just in our past decade or so the interest rates both on construction loans on permanent financing are extremely high compared to what they were even four or five years ago it's just making it really challenging to put your capital stack together which for us so far we have 12 different  funding sources right now just on one one project.

However, our local green developers, builders, and architects are informing us that our processes are particularly problematic for those trying to build innovative, sustainable residential buildings.

There's been a lot of talk in the community about how we can get more new development that is all electric. And we are doing our best to find ways to do that on many fronts.

And we have no way to compel builders. We cannot say that enough. There are constraints on the building code in the state of Michigan and other aspects of state law that make it very difficult for us to compel the building of projects that are all electric. But there may be ways that we can save developers and residents time and money.  or because time is money. So if we are able to do that, then we are saying, it's in your interest to build this way. We don't have to try to morally chastise, because that doesn't work very well. So that's the spirit of this resolution.

One of those that the EDC already moved forward was the building and development process review that is currently ongoing.

Pet stores can thrive by providing pet owners with everything they need to care for their pets, rather than selling the pets themselves. And this model is already followed by the vast majority of pet stores here in Michigan.  Six states and over 460 localities have prohibited the sale of dogs and cats in pet stores, including East Point, Fraser, New Baltimore, Royal Oak, Harbor Springs, St. Clair Shores, and newly Woodhaven here in Michigan.  These laws have shrunk demand for puppies bred in cruel conditions with public records showing 32,000 fewer breeding dogs in USDA licensed puppy mills than 10 years ago.

Let's make it easier rather than harder to build different kinds of housing, diverse housing, to meet the needs of our economically and socially diverse community, right?

I strongly support funding an unarmed non-police public safety response with a dedicated separate phone number and to create that from existing budget resources.

Thirdly, I think it's really past time to dissolve the Council of the Commons, which really was such a heartbreaking, honestly, waste of resources and time, so that we can finally  really begin to activate that parking lot that we have downtown with a public square and mixed-use buildings that have eyes on the plaza and that are bringing the public in.

But many of them are very expensive.  And they'll come just right up front. They'll tell you, we take 20 to 25% up front as an administration fee. We'll enroll the people. We'll cut the checks. And when we ask follow-up questions like, well, what kind of follow-up do you do to see if these programs were beneficial and how the participants felt about it and whether we achieved outcomes? They say, oh, yeah, we do a survey. We'll email out a survey.  And the social scientists on council are all kind of laughing now because that's not really research, right? Now, they may be producing information that's useful and that's interesting for their funders or for some of their other participants, but it is not the type of information that is peer-reviewable and valuable and that can be passed on from one person to the next in a reliable way. And so when we started internally, we started thinking about, well, how do we move forward from here?  This is Ann Arbor. We have one of the finest research institutions on the planet right here. And the population of the city that corresponds with that. We have a highly educated community here, a lot of PhDs. What should we do? And we thought, the people who should be administering this are people who have a really good financial administration framework, who know how to handle federal grant funds, and who can conduct really top notch research. We thought, we need a research partner.  who can do the administration for us and also give us something of quality at the end. And that's what structured the RFP. And what we ended up getting from our friends at Poverty Solutions and the University of Michigan is a proposal that on the whole is going to cost us less money in administration and is going to give us something of  exponentially greater value.

These bikes actually get picked up and they're grouped together and sold in lots far away from Ann Arbor and Michigan. So Attorney Reiser suggested that a better option would be to donate the bikes so that residents who needed them could have them and we quickly agreed.  So the proposed amendment would allow the impounded bicycles to be donated to a tax-exempt organization. Common Cycle is the one that comes to mind, even though it could be any in the ordinance. This is a community-based organization that's dedicated to empowering Ann Arbor to ride bicycles.

I'm excited that this is moving forward. I'd like to thank particularly Council Member Dish for her work on planning commission up and down the line. It is, you know, we all leave here at whatever time we leave here on Monday nights and Council Member Dish rolls back in and does it again on Tuesday. It is a tremendous amount of work and is excellent work and I'm just grateful for what she does and with what our other planning commissioners do.  We ask them to do a lot, and we rely upon them for their expertise and their initiative, and it is of great benefit to the community when they work together with us and help move us all forward.

I'd like to proceed that by saying thanks to Councilmember Song as well because I thought I was just answering questions so I had not prepared any kind of presentation so I appreciate your background. It's interesting because the $124,000 area median income  It does reflect the actual conditions of the marketplace in the competition for housing, but it also under-reflects it because of, and I've talked about this many times in the past, because of students who appear to be in poverty and low income.  may or may not be from a, you know, from their family situation, whether they came from poverty or not, or low income or not. So it's actually under representing what's happening in the marketplace. And even in particularly, not just even, but particularly low income students are having a really hard time even finding housing in Ann Arbor now as well. And we're hearing both anecdotal and real stories about our voucher tenants getting displaced from  the city of Ypsi and Ypsi Township and Pittsfield Township because of the students that are continuing to get pushed farther and farther outside the community. In an odd way, the $124,000 increase in median income is attractive to, maybe this is an odd, but to for-profit developers because the area median income doesn't  exactly ride the same way up and down over time as rents, but it's pretty close. So as income goes up, rent goes up. And so the various programs that we have to apply to put our capital stack together, the median incomes and the rents are much higher than most communities. So in some senses,  We're an attractive community to build affordable housing. If that's the type of housing that you do because you can charge more rent for like a 60% AMI household than you could in other communities. The problem is that our development costs are also higher on the front end. And so you're constantly  throwing the needle between figuring out how to keep your housing costs at an affordable, manageable level on the development side. Right now, our project on Catherine is running about $478,000 a unit, which exceeds what the state MSHDA limitations are for per unit cost. And so we've already gotten a waiver from them to allow us to exceed their per unit cost.  Um, but on the backside, you can also have higher rents, but that is from a for-profit affordable housing developer perspective. When you're coming from a perspective of a nonprofit mission driven, uh, housing developer, even though we could charge $1,600 a month in rent, um, to reach that 60% AMI or 50% AMI household.  that is not the rent that we desire to charge when unless we have a rent subsidy. And so the type of financing that we put together doesn't provide a rent subsidy. The only way you can do that is with a with a some kind of an actual voucher type program. So we will have units that we bring online  that will be affordable, but we are not pricing them at the maximum amount that can be generated, because we know that our households that we're targeting in the community, even at 60% AMI, $1,600 a month is a lot. So we're trying to get units priced at more in the $800 to $1,000 range, which still feels very high. So there's a lot of different factors. The market is  constantly changing you know record low interest a couple years ago and now we're it's definitely not record high interest just in our past decade or so the interest rates both on construction loans on permanent financing are extremely high compared to what they were even four or five years ago it's just making it really challenging to put your capital stack together which for us so far we have 12 different  funding sources right now just on one one project. And I'm sorry if I did I answer all of your questions?", "reasons": "The council member is initiating a discussion on a new agenda item, marking the start of the second public hearings segment."}, "end": {"numbering": 174, "text": "Councilor watson I want to offer my profound. Thanks to mrs. Hall for  brilliantly answering all my questions and really how many conversations that she's made herself available to for me and Councilmember Song working together. There's also the work from the I just want to express a little bit I think the takeaway from Ms. Hall's answer for me is just how hard this is and how  creative we have to be to try to get publicly financed affordable housing built here. Everybody knows we've made a promise on trying to build affordable units. We've made a promise. Our community has affirmed that promise by voting for the housing millage. But this is 12 funding sources. You hear this used on a project.  It just shows there is no when we say there's no silver bullet. There really is no silver bullet because we've been looking for it Um, I want to thank council member rodina as well as a representative of renters commission council member briggs Who has provided some support and some help to write through? Uh housing commission and also I want to thank uh community member zachariah farrah, uh chair of the renters commission because  And he's coming at this angle of a person who wants to rent and wants to be able to stay in Ann Arbor. And so I hear this everywhere. Where's the affordable housing? Why aren't you guys building it?  The answer, if you take the time and listen to Mrs. Hall's thoughtful answer, the answers are there. It's time-consuming, it takes creativity, and it's hamstrung by bureaucracy and older organizations that aren't fitting the new economic context that we, and the constantly changing economic context that we find ourselves in. So thank you again, Mrs. Hall. Thank you to everyone who's aided in this.", "reasons": "The chairperson is initiating a discussion on a new agenda item, marking the end of the second public hearings segment."}}}}
