I do note that on your agenda today, you have approval, second reading, for three new commissioners for ICPOC.  And we believe they will make excellent commissioners. We've gone out and grabbed people and said, the people that we thought would be helpful. We have another one coming probably at your next meeting. So hopefully we will be at a full complement very soon. We are still looking for a youth member. So if there's any one student, we're looking for a student, U of M, EMU, Washtenaw Community College, to fill that spot. We have a lot of work.  to begin doing this fall. I have spoken before, and I'm going to speak again about our public forum that is coming up. It's going to be Wednesday, September 27th. I've heard from a couple of you, and I hope that you will accept our invitation to attend. You know, our ordinance  charges that we are to create an environment which allows for better communication, understanding, and relations between the department and the community. So we're hoping that we have police officers come out. We have asked Dr. Karpiak to come and give a more extended presentation than he did here. And there will be a time for questions if anyone does have questions about that traffic study.  We've asked Councilwoman Harrison to come and give a few words about the driving ordinance, driving disparity ordinance.  Equality Ordinance. And again, there'll be time for questions and answers and discussion. And we're gonna ask the community, we may get five community members, we may get 55. We don't know, we haven't tried this before. But it is an opportunity for folks to come out, talk with us, not just ask questions, but tell us what they want. As I've said before, we are your only commission with the word community in our title. And so we do intend to try and involve the community.  That is basically all that I have. I hope to see some of you on the 27th. We're going to be at the Peace Neighborhood Center. And we are grateful to Commissioner Billups for allowing us to meet at that venue.

Briefly, as Chairman of the Commission on Disability Issues, I stand before you today to also express my unwavering support of the resolution to eliminate sub-minimum wage here in the City of Ann Arbor. And it is time for us to take a stand for fairness and equality and the rights of all individuals, including those with disabilities. You see, sub-minimum wage is often referred to  as the practice of paying individuals with disabilities less than the federal minimum wage. And it is not discriminatory, but perpetuates a system of inequality. And it undermines the dignity and worth of those individuals working hard with a disability and denying them the opportunity to fully participate in the workforce and contribute to their communities.  So I encourage you this evening by abolishing the subminimum wage, you stand as a powerful message to all individuals regardless of their abilities and their equal treatment and respect to have a fair and equitable wage here in the city.

I am both the wheelchair user and the founding director of an organization called Detroit disability power and I want to thank the clerk and the city council for inviting me today.  It is a great honor to be in the company of folks like Zach Damon and Councilwoman Aisha Ghazi-Edwin to support the Disability Voting Rights Week proclamation. This is something that is important for raising awareness and I want to give you a real brief story about why that is. I mentioned I'm a wheelchair user and that I started the Disability Justice Organization.  And a lot of that has to do with my experience as a regular, excited, enthusiastic voter. Many times when I have gone to vote in my wheelchair, I have struggled to do so. I actually live in Detroit, not in Ann Arbor. But what I have learned over the years is that the challenges around accessible voting are not in a singular place, but very common throughout the country.  So back in 2018, I went to vote in my wheelchair. I was very pleased to get into the building to get my ballot. And then I turned around to figure out where I would go fill it out. And there was absolutely nowhere that I could reach from my wheelchair. All of the booths were standing height, and there was nowhere for me to vote. And when I turned around to ask the woman who had signed me in where I should go, she didn't have an answer. And while she was very kind,  She clearly, no one there, had clearly thought about, oh, what do we do if a wheelchair-using voter comes in today? How do we accommodate someone who moves through this world differently? And so after a few minutes of consulting each other, they cleared off the table in the back. I was able to vote privately and independently. That night, I happened to have an advisory meeting of my organization, all of whom were other people with various disabilities.  And as I shared the story of what happened, each of them shared similar stories. These are blind people, people with cognitive disabilities, other people with mobility disabilities. But every single one of us had a story of a challenge voting. Fast forward, very important election of 2020. I showed up to vote. I wanted to use the accessible voting machine. I apparently was the first person that day to ask to do it.  No one there at the precinct knew how to turn it on or what the code was. I waited about 45 minutes while they played phone tag with the others in the headquarters of the clerk's office. And at the end of the day, I was able to vote on the voting machine, but they couldn't tabulate my vote because the paper was a different size than what normally goes in the tabulator from a paper ballot. So I actually left that election not knowing if my vote counted.  And again, it just reinforced that there are lots of different ways that problems can come up on election day, but none of them are unpreventable. Both stories I just told you could easily be solved with a little more training and preparation. And so in 2022, my organization, Detroit Disability Power, worked with the Carter Center down in Atlanta to do a massive audit of Metro Detroit polling sites.  to determine where the accessibility problems were. And while we didn't come to Ann Arbor, we focused on 15 jurisdictions in Southeast Michigan, and the results that came back were very troubling, although not surprising. Of those 261 polling sites that we audited on election day in November of 2022, only 16% were fully accessible.  And so when we look at this data, we know that that means that voter turnout of disabled residents is lower than it should be. We know that people aren't able to vote like they should and are entitled to, and that we have some work to do. And so we are working with very cooperative clerks like yours to ensure that we're  fixing the problems, especially the low hanging fruit problems. There's many of these problems that don't cost money to fix, but also tackling the harder problems like the infrastructure that needs to be altered to make sure that people can get in the building and vote.  So this report is available. It's also, we have lots of briefings and workshops to learn how to make these polling places accessible. There's a lot more I could say about that, but what I'm really here to say today is that I'm very excited for this proclamation. Disability Voting Rights Week is a great way to raise awareness about these things, and I appreciate the time and attention that you're putting towards it."}, {"start": 1106.402, "end": 1127.93, "speaker": "SPEAKER_28", "text": "Thank you, Ms. Cosma.

My name is Elliot Carter. I am a limited license social worker who graduated with my MSW from University of Michigan 2020. I work for disability network Washington member Livingston and I and my organization  Support the passing of Resolution 23-14-69, directing the city administrators to advocate for the Michigan legislature to end the use of 14C certificates in the state of Michigan. Disability Network originally formed as the Ann Arbor Center for Independent Living almost 50 years ago, making us the fourth oldest center for independent living in the country. So much has changed for people with disabilities since 1976.  For starters, lifelong institutionalization is no longer the ever-present threat to people with disabilities that it was, and Americans are much more accustomed to the idea of people with disabilities living full, independent, fulfilling lives, including working the same jobs that non-disabled folks do. Employment opportunities for people with disabilities have increased exponentially with the help of technology and state, federal, and workplace policies.  but an 85-year-old policy is still holding people with disabilities back from full inclusion in the workplace. And this is Section 14C of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. I'm sure it's becoming increasingly clear to the honorable members of this council that the state minimum wage of $10.10 an hour is not enough to get by in the city of Ann Arbor anymore, but it is still legal for some people to be paid less than $1 an hour in Michigan thanks to this policy.  A business, community vocational organization, or educational institution can apply for a federal waiver which allows them to use a convoluted formula with virtually no oversight to pay people with disabilities based on their observed productivity on the job. People without disabilities do not need to have their productivity measured to determine their wages, so why is this still the case for people with disabilities?  The arguments for keeping sub-minimum wage are often effervescent of the shortcomings of other government policies designed to keep people with disabilities out of poverty. And it is true that these policies often require people with disabilities to monitor and report their earnings and assets in order to keep receiving assistance. But organizations like ours, Disability Network, that provide benefits  such as services, such as benefits counseling, excuse me, which allows a person with a disability to see how much they can work at a competitively compensated job. 30 seconds. All right. Several advocates with intellectual and developmental disabilities in Michigan are currently pushing for a state law that includes a phase-out plan that involves connecting from a minimum wage earners to local resources that already exist.  I hope that Michigan joins the 13 states that have currently banned the use of 14 CWOA certificates and support the passing of this resolution.

I'm calling in support of D.C. 's three resolutions to improve data transparency and performance management. I want to thank the authors and sponsors and make honorable mention to John Murphy, who would never want credit for it, but has been years championing city goals that are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound, otherwise known as SMART goals. I appreciate that this resolution highlights the importance of transparency and performance management,  and direct federal implementation process begins. And for people following along as home performance management, according to the Society for Human Resource Management, it's defined as the process of maintaining or improving employee job performance through the use of performance assessment tools, coaching, and counseling, as well as providing continuous feedback.  The last time I addressed Council in person was exactly a year and a half ago on the night that the City Administrator was hired. At that time, I encouraged you to start working on your most important job, evaluating the City Administrator. I recommended doing so intramurally on a quarterly basis with perhaps a more formal evaluation on an annual basis. To my knowledge, in the intervening time, not one Administrator or City Attorney evaluation has been done.  I hope that adopting this resolution sets Council and staff on a path toward accountability and achievement. In order to be effective, though, I believe this resolution must be expanded. I have three suggestions. One is to agree on goals. The resolution makes reference to key performance indicators, but lacks the suggestion of what the key ones are or how to determine them. This should not be left up to staff. Only Council can answer this question, and you should begin a process to determine which ones you really care about. What success looks like  and a time frame that's achievable. For example, are there any outcomes that you care about so much that you would give the city administrator a poor performance review if he didn't achieve it? I hope each of you can think of at least some, and then you can come to consensus on many of them. I want to know what those are, and I'm sure many of the people in the community do too. I hope that in the next budget cycle, it will be clear where money and staffing should be allocated. Number two, start basic evaluations now.  Performance management is critical and it's something that shouldn't wait until this process is complete. Please begin evaluating the administrator or at least the general criteria that have been used in the past. Direct the administrator to begin quarterly reviews of senior staff and reboot council working sessions to get updates from senior staff and give you and the public the opportunity to ask questions. Three, finally set a timeline. I find it ironic that this resolution repeatedly emphasizes accountability but itself fails to mention any timeline.  Please give staff a deadline to pull together a one-pager on current versus best practices in performance management and data transparency, and work out a rough timeline for achieving the rest of the steps in your resolution. Please start the accountability now. I want to add that putting the prioritization and dashboard process in place, which will take several months, is not an excuse for continuing the lack of progress on critical issues like zoning and housing, and the backsliding on loan safety.

I'm calling in today with mixed feelings about DC2, the traffic calming program. On the one hand, this is a good start. And I really appreciate that it really is a good start. But on the other hand, it reads to me as quite timid and honestly insufficient.  First, I'd like to see the inclusion of an explicit mention of life-saving pedestrian and bicycle safety devices followed in the list of speed control elements. As despite being a part of NACTO guidelines, the city appears entirely unwilling to do the trade-off of  some potential damage to a car that has left the roadway in return for the enormous benefit of not killing someone. Frankly, I don't see how this is a hard decision. Bullets are all over the rest of the world, and within the US alone, I have personally seen them in Los Angeles, San Diego, Chicago, Nashville,  and even in our own backyard in Detroit. In fact, I looked on Google Maps and double-checked with some articles, and as it turns out, our city's number one rival, Columbus, Ohio, has real bollards, not just flex posts, at their OSU sports complex. We're really gonna let Columbus beat us? One such location, where bollards, especially removable ones, would be a huge improvement  is the new State Street. If we aren't willing to make this area the permanent pedestrian plaza that it really should be for the safety of everyone, we should be, at minimum, be willing to protect people, be they on foot, in wheelchairs, on bikes, on roller skates, from multi-thousand pound metal devices hurtling  Additionally, this resolution should be a bit more authoritative when removing the requirements of Council approval for traffic calming projects. That's a great start, but any street maintenance that includes vertical elements or resurfacing should be required to include traffic calming and safety measures. 30 seconds. And not to include elements  like sidewalk level crosswalks, pedestrian-protecting by-laws, and protected by-cans should require staff to report why they have chosen not to include them.

I was dreading coming out today. I just returned from 10 days in Incline Village, Nevada, but  I found the speakers both entertaining, informative, and I agreed with most of what they said. So this is great. It seems like young people are starting to agree with me or I'm starting to agree with them. Anyway, the theme of my talk tonight is unintended consequences. Sometimes unintended consequences are just inconvenient. But as a prior speaker mentioned, sometimes they result in death in a roadway.  Regarding traffic calming, I think it's absolutely critical that we look at the unintended consequences. If we are putting traffic calming on one street, we need to look at the parallel streets. And that is something that Sam Schwartz recommends, Sam Schwartz, a consultant who did Vision Zero,  There's an excellent example of what they did with the busway on 14th Street in New York City. So we need to be more methodical in our implementation and consider those unintended consequences. Next, we need to look at school crosswalks. I brought this forward at the last meeting, and I was really concerned about overgrown vegetation, because that's one of my pet peeves. But the first three people I showed it to said  Why isn't the crosswalk marked? It's like, I don't know. And then I checked and the crosswalk design guidelines, which we spent considerable time on, definitely specifies that it should be marked. And so, again,  and unintended consequences, we overlook this. And when I went down there today, I counted over 50 cars that were parked along this area, including right through the crosswalks, because I don't think parents even knew it was a crosswalk because it wasn't marked. My last area is that we are wrongly charging people and endangering pedestrians. And one example is the corner of Beaks  Kingsley and Main Street. There was a greyhound bus driver who hit a pedestrian. I've gone down there, I've looked at it, other engineers have looked at it also. It is humanly impossible to see a pedestrian in that crosswalk because there is inadequate lighting at the crosswalk and there are bright globes that the DDA put in just beyond that. So you're looking at a glare  and you can't even see a pedestrian there. So I hope that you will implement safer crosswalks.

And like other people, I'll pick a theme. My theme will be expectations. And I talked about this last time this was a council, that the citizens when they  voted for the affordable housing millage had certain expectations. And some of that expectation was based on the language of the millage. Some of that expectation was based on things like putting affordable housing units on the old Y lot, which has been talked about for a long time. One of the key reasons that we were gonna have city-owned lots that we already own made available for affordable housing  to keep the cost down. So the expectations were not necessarily met when we had to find out how much money had to be spent to buy the lot that we already own. This is all covered the last time. So I understand where we're at with that now. And there may be good uses for the rest of the money. But again, expectations. Citizens should have a discussion of why the rest of the money is going where it's going, even if it's a good reason.  Because we voted on a village, we have certain expectations of that. While we're talking about affordable housing, we have certain expectations. There's 93 people that we are not housing because our citizens had our expectations broken when the city improperly, illegally approved the lower town plan. 93 units or $9 million of affordable housing that was lost.  And a PUD in disguise, the exact same plan. It's built as a PUD, and there's no reason it wasn't built as a PUD except to avoid 93 units of affordable housing. There's 93 people or more, because it could be more than one person per unit, that are not going to get that affordable housing. Later on tonight, we're going to talk about 33 people, 33 units of affordable housing that you're ready to give away, benefiting private interests,  and not following the law, yet again. When we vote the affordable housing bill, we also had discussion about 415 West Washington and not using Miller's money there because that site didn't qualify well for affordable housing in terms of tax credit and other federal reasons, because slugs laying next to the tracks, et cetera. 30 seconds.

We'll use a PUD there to put money into a payment in lieu, and then that payment in lieu is just going to get taken off the top, and we're going to get net zero money for affordable housing at 415 West Washington, in part because we didn't follow the expectations that were set.

This is Brandon Dimchuk from West Larrytown and Fourth Ward. I'm calling tonight to thank the sponsors of DC2 and to request that you approve this resolution. Our neighborhood has been frustrated by speeding drivers for years, and while some of our streets have received traffic calming, the existing process for having your road calmed is incredibly cumbersome. Streamlining this process and making it automatic during major road work is a great improvement. Furthermore, this model of choosing safety by default should be applied to other road work as well.  I noticed, for example, the recent Packard resurfacing left the lanes excessively wide, didn't buffer the bike lanes, and actually decreased safety by removing the gateway treatments at crosswalks and the green paint in bike conflict zones. It would have been nearly free to make safety improvements during this project simply by painting slightly different lines on the road. We should not leave opportunities like this on the table. DC2 will help fix this in neighborhood streets, but we definitely need some better defaults elsewhere too.  So, once again, please approve DC2 and consider expanding this to the safety by default concept to major roads in a future resolution.

Nearby residents should be receiving a postcard soon if they haven't already and information will be posted shortly to the project website.  Also wanted to use my time here tonight to say a few words about minimum lot sizes and its role in land use reform This is on my mind for two key reasons, you know at our last meeting we approved zoning annex township parcels to a single-family zoning category with a minimum lot size of 5,000 square feet and Then last week councilmember iron I had the chance to meet with the team the consultants that are helping us with the comprehensive land use plan  So I think land use reform is one of the most impactful tools that a city government has to influence housing availability, housing prices, as well as the livability and sustainability of our communities. And minimum lot sizes as a regulatory tool  sets a floor for land costs. So large minimum lot sizes of 5,000 feet became pretty standard in post-war suburbs. They've resulted in driving up housing prices and mandating a spread out development and sprawl, because fewer homes can literally be built in a space. Not to mention excluding residents that cannot afford the amount of square footage that is required.  This might make sense in rural township environment, because there's an argument made that you need a large lot to accommodate septic fields and wells for drinking water. But for Ann Arbor, where housing prices continue to skyrocket and we can't meet our housing needs, I think we really need to apply a critical eye to mandates that basically force lot sizes much higher than 5,000 square feet.  So the recent annexing decision, you know that provided a small opportunity to look critically at this regulation and I hope that we continue to look at this as You know, we'll embark on the comprehensive land-use process."}, {"start": 2802.923, "end": 2806.266, "speaker": "SPEAKER_28", "text": "Thank you Councilman"}, {"start": 2809.333, "end": 2865.455, "speaker": "SPEAKER_05", "text": "Thank you, Mayor.

My name is Tom Renker, and I'm representing the Ann Arbor Area Board of Realtors. And I'd like to just kind of start out and thank you for letting me speak and kind of voice our concerns. We talked a couple of weeks ago, we talked a lot about the time that's been spent on this, that the Energy Commission has spent many years working on this. We shouldn't be doing this for the Energy Commission. We should be doing this because it's the right thing to do. Realtors have been working on this for a long time.  Our first meeting with the Energy Commission was in June 2018, more than five years ago. And out of that, two members, two realtors became members of the subcommittee of the Energy Commission, Jack Brown of Howard Hanna and Chrissy George of Trillium Real Estate.  They worked with the subcommittee many times. They did research work. They contacted other municipalities. They contacted other association of realtors. And the findings of that subcommittee were that, yes, great things come out of this. There's some wonderful statistics and data that comes out of these reports that are very valuable to the city itself. But in the end, there was truly no measurable results.  that the buyers, after they received these reports, did nothing with them simply because they couldn't afford it. Like here in Ann Arbor, we talked about this last time, average sales price year-to-date, $630,000. Buyers are tapped out. They've spent it. And true, there are incentives available. They can get $1,000, $2,000, $3,000, $4,000, but to get those incentives, what do they have to spend? Buyers are not going to go further into debt to actually make this happen.  So we're sitting here today saying that we're going to force sellers to do something they don't need and will never use by doing the audit. And we're going to have the sellers give it to the buyer. And true, the buyer will have some use for it up front. They'll see another estimate of what it might cost. They may be able to use that number to say, you know, is this good or bad? If I'm looking at a house that's a one and one that's a five, it gives me some negotiation power. Maybe I choose the five. Who knows where that five's going to be.  But the point is, is that we're forcing someone to do something that they don't really need to do, giving it to someone that won't use it. It just seems like a real waste of some considerable funds that we're going to spend $200,000 to $300,000 a year with the way that this is currently structured. We look at staffing, all in expenses. This is a big expense.  Let's find someone that will actually use these reports. You have thousands of people every year that are putting together building permits, they're hiring contractors, they're a perfect source for an audience for whether it be a forced or whether it be an offering to actually use this type of an ordinance or use this type of report for some real value.  So I would ask you to really think about this, that, you know, what we're planning to do is not going to help us reach our 820 goals. I mean, Jack and Chrissy, ultimately, they were never asked to come back. They were told they would. They weren't because they basically were told that what they were saying wasn't really in their best interest.

One of the hats that I wear in the real estate business as a buyer's broker, I do not ever represent sellers, only buyers. So my clients would not be paying for this report. They'd be the recipients of this report. My clients now get  a home inspection. The vast majority of the home inspections that I have had experience with would call out the low-hanging fruit, best thing for your buck, energy efficiency items when inspecting the home for my clients. If my clients are doing work after they've made the purchase, they're most likely to do  the most cost-effective, lowest-paying food, best bang for your buck improvements. They've already been told what those are. A comprehensive report might have some impact for the people who would be more aggressive about the improvements that they would make in their home after they buy it, and that would be a good thing indeed. But the vast majority  in my personal opinion, in my professional opinion, the vast majority of the items that would actually get done are already being identified. I would much rather see this amount of money from our climate action millage be spent in achieving reductions in carbon rather than producing reports that may not be adding any value.  or the value may be greater low compared to what value is already out there. I would like to see people who aren't necessarily selling their home, but who would be a good beneficiary of our climate action or energy improvements to their homes, get the money to actually make those improvements instead of  the money going to inspections and reports based solely on the sale of homes. I don't think we're identifying and targeting the best bang for our buck on our limited funds for our climate action millage. In terms of equity and the tax money. Again, expectation. We have a climate action millage and we expect to be able to reduce the carbon  with this, not just produce reports that are essentially redundant in terms of what will actually get done, even though they would be very valuable and know what could be done.

The motivation behind this use was simple, to create a place where this cohort could create a foothold in Ann Arbor as they launched a new job, a new enterprise, or the next stage of their professional education. A great deal of research supported this strategy.  830 Henry passed its certification of occupancy in early 2021. While COVID was the justification for many businesses to completely change their course of direction, especially those that required people to be in close quarters, this use plan was not abandoned. Having made the commitment at Planning Commission to house young professionals, graduate students, and recent grads, this continued to be the 830 Henry occupancy focus.  Sometimes these occupants stay for weeks and many times they stay for months. This commitment included digital tools to attract and invite individuals and startups that fit the use plan. At the end of the day, we realized because of consumer habits that the best method to attract occupants was through the Airbnb booking platform. Simply put, this platform is used for far more than vacation rentals.  and people are using it more and more for longer term rentals. 830 Henry still uses its own digital tools to book occupancy. The vast majority of occupants are U of M graduate students, professors, athletes, and coaches, as well as new startup teams. I don't believe that at the 2018 Planning Commission meeting, there was a great deal of concern about what technology would be used to fill the units.  I think the concern was, would this development support the housing needs of Ann Arborites? Per current regulation, this means people who live in Ann Arbor for 31 days or more. Some 830 Henry occupants stay for less than 31 days, and many stay for far longer. I would ask council members not to get caught up in hot button terminology, for example, Airbnb, used by people who are trying to run council from the outside.

My name's Heidi Posher. The South Town Sustainable Energy System will set a benchmark  for sustainable building construction and ongoing clean energy production at a state, regional, and national level. Sustainable benefits of the Southtown project relate to a built environment constructed to optimize energy efficiency and the activation of occupant participation in programs to reduce and preserve energy.  The project incorporates renewable on-site energy generation, as well as a microgrid designed to coordinate all of these components into a holistic, sustainable energy system. Southtown is designed with enhanced carbon lifecycle building materials that include mass timber, a building envelope that accounts for solar and heating patterns across four seasons, a geothermal system that exchanges heat between the building and the site to greatly diversify the impact of HVAC load,  and green rooftops to avoid the creation of heat islands. The bedrock of the sustainable energy system is Southtown's microgrid control system, which will manage and reduce campus load and optimize the integration of the sustainable energy resources to targeted objectives. This is so, so important because it provides a level of control that almost every building doesn't have.  These objectives, these targeted objectives include reliability, as in the ability to disconnect from the grid when necessary and allow the occupants to shelter in place, as well as net zero emissions. Under this design, it will actually be possible to run the entire development as a carbon negative footprint. I really want to emphasize that. The objective of the Southtown microgrid design is 100% uptime and carbon negative operation  completely eliminating the 3,600 pounds of CO2 emissions that pollute our environment with every megawatt hour of electricity that's delivered. We can do this while still preserving an all-electric campus. Ann Arbor's a clear leader in municipality-driven  sustainability in the United States. Southtown presents a unique opportunity for area residents to live their strong commitment to curbing climate change in the most meaningful way possible. I'd respectfully ask council to make sure that we're not distracted by other issues and we're focusing on what really matters here.

I'm an assistant professor. I submitted my tenure package on Friday. So I'm in campus. And below campus, I just think that Lower Burns Park I think of as residential. And I worry that by allowing campus business to expand, to start at that bottom edge, it will just tip over everything to become campus business district all the way south of us.  And particularly one aspect of the new zoning that I was concerned about is the offsets of zero, there's a zero.  No inches of offset is required under the new zoning. The home that I owned prior to moving to Ann Arbor that I owned, I lived in Boston before coming here, but I owned a property and lived in Manhattan before then in a neighborhood called Turtle Bay. And in Turtle Bay, there was development just as much concrete as possible up to the edge everywhere that you could go. And it had a really different feel to that neighborhood.

This property is not near the campus business district and should not be zoned as such. The energy advantages touted by the developer could be accomplished under the current zoning.

I'm sorry if the developers object to us talking about those things, but it's true. Okay. As we know, our city is in dire need of affordable long-term rentals for our residents, not short-term rentals for visitors.  The current zoning would not allow these short-term rentals because the city has ruled that non-principal residence short-term rentals are not allowed in residential neighborhoods. The developer is trying to use rezoning to put in short-term rentals, of which they already own many in our city. They say they will limit the number of short-term rentals in South Town,  But this rezoning would open the gates to more short-term rentals in the area. Please do not approve this zoning, this rezoning. Speaking of zoning, the consultant for the comprehensive land use plan was to start on June 1st. And yet I have heard nothing about it and nothing about any public engagement regarding the comprehensive plan. There is no current information on the city's website.

Hi. Yeah, I'm really excited about  more housing being built. I'm excited to see the energy efficiency be part of this. I think, though, that we should remember that larger housing construction is automatically going to be more energy efficient than single-family homes, just because of their nature. It's easier to heat and cool them.  It's easier to provide water and power to them than it is to the single family homes per person on a per person basis. Also, I am not concerned about the fact that some of these are going to be used for  Shorter term rentals because the. I couldn't find the exact number, but it's going to be something like 250 new apartments are going to be built there. And if some of those. You know, even if some of those were. Left totally empty with a, with a middle finger sign on the window, like.  That would still be more housing than is there right now. So if we're worried that there's not enough housing in there, well, then we should let somebody build a big old apartment building with lots of housing in it.  And this is what's going to do it. This project is going to do it. Even if some of those people don't stay in those apartments for their entire lives, they're still people and they can still be neighbors.

I am going to borrow some words from a former planning commissioner to say that in my opinion, rezoning the proposed South Town development from R4C to C1AR is exactly the opposite of what we want.  Why is this so? For a rather simple reason. R4C, the current zoning of Southtown, does not allow short-term rental non-principal residence as a primary use. I'll say that sentence again. R4C, the current zoning of Southtown, does not allow short-term rental non-principal residence as a primary use. But C1AR does.  In fact, as one of the conditions of rezoning, the developer has offered that Southtown will contain no more than 30% short-term rental. Furthermore, if Southtown is rezoned to C1AR, it is likely to set a precedent. That means that the city would risk a lawsuit if they were to deny the petitions of future developers seeking a C1AR rezoning in this area.  All of this could lead to the South Town areas becoming a sort of air bed and breakfast land. Is this what we want for our city? No, it isn't. So I would ask City Council, instead of protecting the interests of those who would bring us more short-term rentals, why not protect the interests of prospective long-term renters who would like to make Ann Arbor their full-time home?

I have written you at length about some of the legal issues here. I want to echo what one of the gentlemen who spoke in person said, that the sustainability aspects of this project are laudable.  However, that really is not the zoning issue at hand here. C1AR is not appropriate. It was designed for the campus. It was this distance, not nearly anywhere near anything called campus. The words are getting butchered a little bit. But C1AR is designed as a downtown zero setback type of zoning. It's the most intense zoning at the D1.  We have what's before, I'm sorry, there's another development called Five Corners that's from State, Packard, and Art Street. That is in the Campus Business District. There's a map that shows what the Campus Business District is, and that's in it. And they're asking for a PUD. So now we have a few blocks of R4C south of there, down to South Town, which is asking not for a PUD, but for CBOE and AR. PUD would solve all the problems  that I identified in the legal issues here for Southtown without creating legal jeopardy for the city and creating a very hard, the city was very hard-pressed to turn down a C1AR application along State Street across from, not the campus business district, you know, where McKinley and Dewey are, but the athletic complex.  With all those athletic buildings, would that not be a natural place for short-term rentals to pop up? Well, the nature of conditional zoning is, if you approve it for one person down at South Town, it has to be voluntary. So the next person wants to see where they are, and they don't have to ask for the limits at 30%. They can stand mute on any limits of height or any limits on the number of short-term rental units.  It has to be voluntary. You can't make them add those on. So if their application is otherwise valid for CWIN AI,  If you turn them down, you're going to get sued, and you're going to lose. That's the real-world situation. So you know at this moment in time right now, you're opening yourself up to that legal jeopardy. Now, you said when it came to by-right developments that you didn't even want to hear them. You wanted the site plans to be heard at planning positions and not come to you because of a similar issue of you turned them down, and they were by-right, you'd get sued, and you'd lose.

If the proposed site plan falls through,  It's still appropriate for this to be rezoned. And I hope that someone else would develop the parcel into a mixed-use development.

First of all, I just want to echo what several other people said. I think the C1AR zoning is totally appropriate on the site and I think it's also worth noting that the staff report unequivocally said the same thing.  So I want to talk about short-term rentals for a second. I think this whole short-term rental versus long-term rental thing is a false dichotomy. We have demand for both in our community. There are a lot of people who come to Ann Arbor for very laudable reasons, and they need a place to stay while they're here. Sometimes they need a space to stay while they are searching for long-term housing because our housing market is so problematic. The truth is that  We actually need on the scale of tens of thousands of new housing units in our city to meet the demand that we have. While what we're talking about, last I heard we have maybe a few hundred short-term rentals. So short-term rentals aren't having a massive impact on our housing needs. But also, I've long been pretty frustrated by the city's habit of putting all of our hotels out on the periphery of town in extremely car-dependent areas. I think that people visiting our city should have the opportunity to properly experience our walkable community  And, you know, something that we're proud of, rather than feeling obligated to bring even more cars into it. Now, shifting gears a bit, I honestly, I sort of feel it's a little bit problematic that the developer felt obligated to offer all of these zoning conditions at all. I mean, maybe it's good that they did. Maybe that will make your job easier tonight. But  we seem to be in a habit of requiring every development to have a tailor-made and heavily restricted zoning district, either a PUD or by telegraphing that we want all of these voluntary conditions added, which is this really the definition of voluntary? I don't know. In any case, this is no way to achieve the scale of change that our city requires to solve its most urgent problems. Again, like I said, tens of thousands of housing units.  So I don't understand why see when they are is something that we're approaching with such reluctance here, it's a zoning district that could allow this project and could allow others like it to be constructed by right. A suggestion from some folks seems to be that we need more zoning districts that are more persnickety and restrictive about what 30 seconds.  I think that's dead wrong, and I hope that this is something that will get addressed in the future in the comprehensive planning exercise. But in the meantime, this conditional rezoning is what's before you. I think it's an excellent project, and I hope you'll approve it.

Remaining unaddressed from the conversation so far is the issue that the conditional zoning requested. It's clearly the type of conditional zoning that the courts rule against. And why they do is very important  to both the zoning and the site plan issues. Two of the conditions, one the height and the other the set short-term rental issue, they serve the applicant's private interests because the existing status quo, the current zoning, has a lower height limit than that condition and totally bars non-primary residence short-term rentals. So the comparison that's being done in the analysis here  is incorrect. You need to be comparing it to what the status quo is. No short-term rentals that are non-primary residence. And a height, I believe, what, 30 or 40 feet for R4C. Not comparing those limits to the proposed zoning district that's being requested. So they're actually getting more, not less. These are not limits beyond  what's currently allowed, the limits to what's currently allowed, they're actually more than what's currently allowed. So this is really being measured incorrectly. Now note, the conditional zoning say on electrification, that's high. So in evaluating both the zoning and the site plan, you need to relook. The planning reports are not correct. The comparison is not being done correctly.  And you have to reject this. Now, PUD would resolve those issues. You have a legal remedy available to you. We recall back to the Garnet, which came before council, again, with conditional zoning that was inappropriate. That was turned down.  and came back as a PUD and approved as a PUD with the exact same site plan. So this exact same site plan.

The fact that this building has the ability to be energy negative, thanks to its solar, while on the surface it is a good thing, leaves me with a little bit of a bad taste in my mouth, given how close this is to the center of the city, to downtown, etc.  This is the sort of place where we should be having more density than that, more height than that, et cetera.

Despite what others may say, the site plan should not be developed as a PUD. Assertions of the contrary are simply incorrect. The proposed site plan conforms with C1AR entirely with the minor variance granted by the Zoning Board of Appeals. The variance was granted in order to allow the developers to provide a free public plaza about the size of the library lane surface parking lot.  without going over the allowable building size. A fully conforming site plan here would just be worse because we wouldn't get the plot in space. The conditional zoning from the previous hearing simply restricts the developer and any future developers from hooking the building up to natural gas, adding more parking, or using more than 30 percent of it for short-term rentals. Those conditions are  not bad and do not require an otherwise conforming site plan to be developed as a PUD. PUDs are for out of the ordinary developments that can't be built in an existing zone.

As folks who may be listening but not as familiar with the background of this, we have been in the process of rezoning some of our commercial corridors to TC1. TC1 is a new transit corridor district that we are,  Applying the long existing transit corridors The goal of it is to facilitate encourage and support redevelopment and infill development to realize mixed-use projects and achieve affordable housing enable more housing choices more sustainable forms of development and reduced resource energy needs and Our first quarter to rezone was Stadium and Eisenhower then came Stadium which is  what precipitated these questions around amendments, and then next in line are Plymouth and Washtenaw, hopefully. So along Stadium, obviously we had these, this is a slightly different area where we've got more residents and a nice mix of locally owned businesses.  But one of the things that became clear during that process and one of the reasons we asked for these amendments is became clear that we cannot do things like TC1 currently prohibits car share. It prohibits car rental. So if we're trying to encourage folks to live car light lifestyles or car free lifestyles, it's nice if they choose to do that to be able to  in close proximity of their homes be able to walk over and go to a car share and Check out a car for the day, but currently that is not not permitted. So as folks have rightly noted from callers Unfortunately, the UDC combines car sales and rental in our uses and I think that's something we might want to address moving forward Because at the point of these amendments is not to encourage car dealerships fortunately, the amendments would be by special exception use so everything would go in front of  Planning Commission for review before it would move forward the other piece the other amendment that this brings forward is the ability to do Car repair which folks may say why would you? Want to have car repair and an area where we're trying to do less car centric Become less car centric  What we know is that services in close proximity to where people live allows them to walk and bike more. So even in the case of car repair, this is something that people can, if they own a car, they have the ability to go drop it off and then walk home, bike home. So I'll give the example, for the example of my father. He lives in apartments right behind Stadium. He has  chronic health issues, disability. And when he needs to go to get his car repaired, he's going to take it to a locally owned shop just down the street. And instead of calling one of his family members to then drive, go get him and then take him back home and then have us go back home, which you can imagine all those different car trips, what he's able to do is walk home. And so, you know, even in this situation, what we're doing is actually enabling less car usage. So thank you."}, {"start": 7050.78, "end": 7054.362, "speaker": "SPEAKER_28", "text": "further discussion. Council Member Dish."}, {"start": 7054.362, "end": 7215.364, "speaker": "SPEAKER_35", "text": "Thank you so much for that Council Member Briggs and thank everyone who called in to offer us feedback on these modifications to TC1, so we've heard concern about including sales and we've included sales in these permitted by special exception use on TC1 in recognition that auto repair often even typically is attached to retail.  And in addition to some of the points that Council Member Briggs has just made about people being able to live relatively independently and access services that they need for their automobiles,  during our transition to fewer and fewer automobiles, I would mention that the circular economy is pro-repair. And that does really need to include automobile repair. So this is partly, I think, what we're having is a philosophical discussion. And I think for some of us,  We would like TC1 to be leading the way without cars and with pedestrians and with bicycles. And I love that vision, but I think that we are actually in a transition. And so I think that we have to  recognize that people will be hopefully having one car per household, maybe giving up cars and having car shares, but I don't think that we can legislate cars out of existence next year. And so I am okay with the things that are here. I also think that it's important to say that the existing form-based standards in TC1  make it, I believe, safe to permit limited automobile-related uses there. So we have setbacks, we have other pedestrian-friendly features, we have limitations on surface parking, and surface parking can't be between the road and the storefront. I think those things mean that we may get car-related uses that are more palatable.  And finally, I want to say that without making this change, there are existing auto-related uses on these TC1 corridors. Of course there are, because they're at the periphery, and so that's where auto-related uses have been. If we do not make these amendments to TC1, the existing auto-related uses become non-conforming, which means that they are frozen the way they are, because they will not be significantly updated until they pass out of service.  So we would rather it is possible. I don't know how likely but it is possible that these places could be renovated before they pass out of service to be more aligned with our TC1 goals. We rule that out if we render them non-conforming."}, {"start": 7219.781, "end": 7331.717, "speaker": "SPEAKER_07", "text": "Thank you, and thank you to my two colleagues who've already spoke about this. I, too, when I read this, it hurt my heart to read car sales as part of this because I think our minds immediately go to exactly what we don't want to see in this corridor. But I see this as very much reflective of growing pains. This is something we want to encourage, and we want to be a model for the city in terms of how these transit corridors work.  And I do think, you know, one, to underscore what Councilmember Briggs said, that currently the UDC doesn't distinguish between car sales, car share, you know, and we do want people who want to have a car light lifestyle to have access to a vehicle when they need it. There are times when you need to drive.  and making that easy for people to do and to wrap their head around and to remove the fear around being in an area where biking and walking is encouraged. I think that's an important part of our infrastructure and acknowledging what Council Member Dish said as well is we have to accept that as part of reality, but we also need to encourage the behavior that we want as well by building that infrastructure.  I think the second part of it around the circular economy is that allowing people to repair their cars and not have to hop into a car or take three different cars or get multiple cars to go and drop off their car, that just seems silly to me as well. And so the ability for people to maintain their vehicles for as long as possible I think is really important. And I think it's a financial consideration as well. If you can fix your car versus having to buy a new one.  I think that's an important thing for us to think about when we when we go through this Do I think that as this is stated right now is the end-all be-all? No, but do I think it's a step in the right direction? Yes, and that's why I'll be supporting it Councilor Ackman"}, {"start": 7333.236, "end": 7476.792, "speaker": "SPEAKER_33", "text": "Thank you, Mayor, and thanks to my colleagues who commented so far. As I said in the last meeting, I'm one of the people that co-sponsored the initial resolution that got this work going, so I wanted to acknowledge that and also say that I still support addressing the existing narrow rights of way, even though I won't be supporting the addition of auto sales and rental.  I saw a perfect example of the narrow rights-of-way today on Stadium that drive-through bank is going up and it is right up to the narrow sidewalk and it just was a reminder to me of once again of like how oppressive feeling that is especially as we want to allow  other modes of transportation in that corridor. But I digress. Like I said, I won't be supporting this. I think our primary aim in these corridors is increasing mixed uses, encouraging high density, encouraging alternative transportation like bus, walking, biking, et cetera, and discouraging auto-dependent and auto-oriented uses.  I understand the argument that's being made about having things in a walk's reach of where people live. I personally depend on my bike to get around. My husband has the car all day in East Lansing, so when I need a car, I have to rent one, and I do have to go to a distance to get a rental.  But I still think that number one, there's absolutely no reason that we need auto sales in these districts. And number two, if the aim is to encourage folks to travel by bus, which I didn't hear anybody say, bike or foot by building more density in these corridors. And I think we need to make way for those uses that are more consistent with the same. And that includes housing, grocery stores, cafes, workplaces.  I also noted the response that we got from staff in a memo in response to questions that they said that the form-based requirements and the parking maximums would be challenging for the construction of new automobile sales and rental facilities.  But the uses could be viable if granted a special exception use in an existing building or site. And we know that we have plenty of these sprawling sites. So if we don't want them, and I think that the transit corridor is a deliberate policy, move not to, then why are we allowing a special use exception? I also looked at other transit-oriented development policies in other cities and  It's pretty standard to exclude these uses. So personally, I'm comfortable taking a dive and Excluding them here."}, {"start": 7476.792, "end": 7483.497, "speaker": "SPEAKER_28", "text": "Thank you further discussion I'm sorry counselor.

Well, I did some reading into a number of studies that have been done in the cities that have had these for a while, cities like Austin and Portland and Minneapolis and others.  A 2021 study of Austin, which has had its energy score ordinance for 10 years, found that new home buyers are a motivated audience for these scores, and they typically spend an additional $4,000 on home improvement projects in the first year of ownership, compared to the annual spending of existing homeowners on energy, that is.  In Portland, Energy Trust recently conducted an analysis on homes which had received a score between 2017 and 2019 through its, you know, home sales disclosure program. And of these homes, over 2,000 applied for incentives for energy efficiency measures, and these upgrades resulted in almost 1 million kilowatt hours of electricity savings.  and over 60,000 therms in natural gas savings. The city of Ann Arbor, so our homeowners may well use these reports. The city of Ann Arbor will certainly use these reports just as the aforementioned cities have used them to identify the kinds of repairs they should be recommending that all residents undertake. Such recommendations are important for cities like ours where the housing stock is older.  The city will also use these reports, as these other cities do, to address and remedy energy inequities. The data we will gather through the home energy scores will help us determine which households have greater need and can benefit the most from city-sponsored grants to make energy improvements. Some of you may have also heard a suggestion that we link the home energy score to building permits pulled at the time of a renovation.  I see this as a both and because we are talking about different populations, people buying versus people renovating. I also agree that we do need to find a way to bring existing homeowners into this program. And I'm not a lawyer, but I worry that it may not be legal to do so via the building permits, given that the state of Michigan does not give cities autonomy over the building code.  possibly we could offer free home energy scores for people doing certain smaller scale renovations. As for those doing larger scale renovations, we expect and hope the state legislature will pass energy efficient updates to the building code, which will mean that larger scale renovations will make buildings significantly more energy efficient. So I will be voting for this and I am pleased to see it coming before us after the work that has gone into it."}, {"start": 7771.248, "end": 7893.047, "speaker": "SPEAKER_05", "text": "Thank you, Mayor. So, you know, as I previously shared, I am in full support of the intended goals I've heard. You know, I agree that we need to do everything that we possibly can in our fight against climate change. My concern with this ordinance has always been its potential to increase racial and economic disparities in the home buying market.  among those who are more likely to have low energy efficiency scores and who are less likely to have the money to make upgrades. These individuals are likely to be our neighbors who are low income, on a fixed income, people of color, people with disabilities, and those with other marginalized identities.  My concerns are supported by the A20 plan itself. On page 52 of our A20 plan, under equity impact, I've heard, I quote, lower income homeowners may suffer lower sales prices for their homes if they have inefficient homes. Rents may rise for highly efficient rental units, which may further exacerbate race and economic and income disparities in the community.  So I believe tracking data is essential in the implementation of HERD, as is prioritizing those with the highest need for funding assistance to make energy upgrades. I will be voting yes on this tonight, but I also will be working with OSI and my council colleagues to create a resolution  that I hope will address proactive targeting of residents who are low income now, before a herd goes into place, encouraging them to undergo a free assessment, and providing them with the financial assistance that is available to them. Prioritizing these type of homeowners in general once the program launches,  And that a plan be developed for comprehensive monitoring, evaluation, and tracking of low energy efficiency scores, where they are overrepresented, the demographics of these areas, and other criteria which will help us assess potential unintended consequences.

I, too, just want to echo that I think having this information as a home buyer is important. It's something that  You know, when I purchased my home, I did an inspection, and I got a list of things that, while passing the inspection, would likely need to be upgraded in the next couple of years, or things that could be improved now, but didn't necessarily provide a failed inspection. Having that information on things that are specifically related to the  to energy and to the savings that I could have if I made my home more energy efficient. As I looked at the list of things that could be updated in my existing inspection, I looked at the ways that over the next few years I could continue to implement some of those. I prioritized some of them as things that I knew would be coming. And knowing that there are things that could impact  how energy efficient my home is, how that may reduce my electric bill, how that may help to contribute to our goals of becoming carbon neutral would rank on my list of priorities.

We are asked to rezone 10 lots that total 1.66 acres, which are located south of East Stadium Boulevard between South State Street and South Industrial Boulevard in the central part of the city.  The rezoning will be from R4C to C1AR with conditions. This rezoning will allow considerable greater density on this parcels. The parcels are currently multifamily residential and they currently provide 38 rental units.  Rezoning will allow construction of two multi-story towers for a mixed-use building totaling 22,000 square feet that will provide approximately 215 apartments, where currently there are 38. And it will include ground floor retail, office, and child care space.  Now, I would like to clear up an unfortunate misunderstanding that has raised some unnecessary fear about this project in the community, some of which we have heard expressed tonight. Council's improvement of Southtown would not obligate us to approve future applications for C1AR zoning in the area of Southtown or in any other area of the city.  and it would not open the gate for a flood of STRs in that area or in any other. There is no such thing as an application that is otherwise valid for a zoning change. Zoning changes are considered on a per-petition basis, and any decision we make tonight is not automatically precedent-setting for other parcels.  I am not a lawyer and neither is the caller who spoke to this point, but I do not believe that our vote opens the city to legal jeopardy, and I believe that I have been well advised on this point. We are not asking, we do not believe that a PUD would be appropriate for this project because PUDs should not be used.  when there is an appropriate zoning category. And in this case, there is one, C1AR. This project is across from the University of Michigan golf course, in the neighborhood of the stadium, and across from a business district. The developer offered four conditions. One, limiting the maximum height for the property to 100 feet. C1AR has no limit. The maximum number of vehicle parking spaces for residential use on the property will be one per dwelling unit.  The principal use of the property shall be multiple-family residential, and no more than 30% of the units may be short-term rentals. The property shall have no natural gas connection except for emergency backup power. All but the provision-limiting STRs were part of the site plan that the developers brought to the Planning Commission, so they were very happy to offer these conditions, and they were happy to offer the one about STRs as well. Now I am going to do some math, and this is a little dangerous, but  If the development maxes out the 30% ST STR's that will be 64 to 65 out of 218 units 218 minus 65 gives us total residential 153 I don't have total confidence in that number, but I think it's pretty close which is a net gain of roughly 115 units over what is currently on the site which is as I've said three times now 38 Councilmember I am done"}, {"start": 8562.457, "end": 8570.121, "speaker": "SPEAKER_28", "text": "Further discussion?

Will it be sustainable?  will it meet with our goals? And not all of that is built into C1AR. In fact, it doesn't require housing. So to remove 38 units of housing and have no guarantee of housing being built there should something  happen and the site plan doesn't move forward it makes it really easy for me tonight to be able to vote on this because conditions have been placed on this and so as Councilmember Dish already read them for me it is it's wonderful to be able to see that there's not this property  regardless of who develop it, will not have natural gas connections, that the principal use of the property shall be multifamily residential, and no more than 30% of the dwelling units may be short-term rental, and that there is a maximum number of vehicle parking spaces for the residential uses.

Thank you, Mayor. So this is in the fourth ward, and I wanted to thank everyone that spoke about this. Someone brought up us, you know, I guess I'll just speak for myself, running on affordable housing. And, you know, I ran on a platform of providing more housing of all types. People who work in affordable housing will be the first to tell you that we need more housing of all types to meet our affordability crisis.  And in fact, I recall several months ago when the topic of this development came up, I'm pretty sure that City Council got a letter of support from Avalon, who is the next door neighbor to this development. So all that is to say that I think this is in alignment with our desires to provide more housing. Councilmember Dish already went through the numbers, which I was prepared to speak. You know, this is a net gain in housing.  The needs that they plan to provide for in the shorter realm, and I think it's probably important to specify that short-term rental is defined as 30 days or less, but we do have a lot of people that come into our community that need a longer-term but shorter-than-a-year stay.  Personally, I housed a postdoc in my house at one point when I was a graduate student. We have visiting scholars. We have people that are making use of our hospital. We have people that are having extensive repairs done to their house that need a place to stay. Not to speak of all of the, you know, startup development people that I think that these developers are interested.  So I think, you know, this is a need that needs to be met. I think this development's exciting. You know, I'm a little dismayed at some of the comments about, I think that there's been a lot of fear mongering. And I think as a result, you're hearing people react to that about this being a slippery slope.  And I certainly understand that people don't want to be surrounded by transient residents in the neighborhood that they've put roots down in. But again, you know, we're deciding on this parcel, the set of parcels. This isn't a decision for all of Lower Burns Park.

The difference is that many will be housed in hotels and a few rentals that could be found for families. Another difference is that American families are not welcoming them into their own homes during a pandemic.  So we know Southtown might not meet refugees immediate needs either unless say they employ refugees and other low-income residents. So what's the connection? The connection is that we cannot truly be a welcoming community without addressing housing supply, all types of housing. Our housing crisis has become a game of musical chairs. We do not have enough chairs. No one moves when the music plays.  Nonetheless, they are paid above market rate, and no one is giving up their chairs for below market rate or what they originally paid. And when the university snatches those chairs, we invite builders to build benches next to a stadium that nearly doubles our city's population with every football game, next to a stadium that has been in place in some form since 1927 or for the past 96 years.  Thankfully, that work will also bring additional taxes as investments to our affordable housing millage. Let me also add that I'm extremely grateful that this site will include child care. Federal pandemic child care funding expires on September 30th. By one projection, 70,000 child care centers will close around the country, but to know that a center will be opening here,  When schools still struggle to bring back pre-pandemic before and after care, that's community building in a state that is supposed to be growing our population.

So and as I mentioned before there will be one auto parking space for every four apartments which is a ratio we really like because it's not a high ratio, and one bicycle space for every apartment which is another ratio that is great.  One of the speakers at the public hearing raised a concern about setbacks. The building will have front setbacks along its four street sides, ranging from 5 to 10 feet at a minimum. The front setbacks are greater than that in many locations because of the variations in the building design.  The building will also meet Ann Arbor's downtown street design manual guidelines for destination streets. And if that sounds abstract to you, let me put it differently. We use this design to ensure a hospitable environment for pedestrians and cyclists and leave room for other things that make pedestrians cool and happy, such as street trees.  This building will provide at least 19 feet from the back of the curb and the building face. It also, as has been mentioned, has a public pedestrian plaza and green roofs. The site plan provides for sustainability in three major ways. It is an all-electric project, which, as we heard earlier, will be achieved by geothermal and solar.  It uses mass timber and cross-laminated timber sourced from sustainably managed forests. This is a building structure that continuously stores carbon and may remove approximately 1,700 metric tons of carbon from the air, which is equivalent to over 4 million miles driven by gas-powered cars.

So this comes to us from a resolution that was passed at the last Transportation Commission meeting in August. And this is one of the first things that I started to work on early in my term on council. I think it's work that began before.  I was on when Councilmember Briggs was the liaison on the Transportation Commission. So this is the work of a subcommittee that was tasked with looking at how we might improve the neighborhood traffic calming program. And it was kind of the perfect thing for me to get involved in because I ran, you know, on a commitment to prioritize safe roads for all.  So we have a long list of traffic calming projects and requests and I know that personally my inbox fills with a lot of complaints about speeding a neighborhood streets and other dangerous behaviors like not stopping at stop stop signs Using streets as cutthroughs to avoid traffic lights is a recent one that I heard about And so we know that the demand for this is high and  Also, community engagement around capital improvement projects indicates a high demand for slowing vehicle speeds and improving the comfort on our local streets. But where the problem exists is that the process as it exists now is pretty onerous, and it doesn't allow staff to incorporate well-established tools for traffic calming in road construction projects where calming is needed unless and until residents engage in a separate petition-led process.  So one example of this is the Greenview Project. Greenview is very close to my house. It's a street that runs between Sio Church and Stadium, so it's used as a cut-through. It's also extremely wide. It runs straight. It has no stops between one side and the other, and so speeding has long been a problem on that road.  So when they were engaging the neighborhood process of engagement, they came to the residents and said, we know that there's a speeding problem on here. We have these goals in our transportation plan to make the road safe. So we need to slow the traffic.  However, there's this whole set of tools that we cannot use, including speed humps, any vertical elements basically, raised crosswalks, speed tables, because that is exclusively the domain of the Neighborhood Traffic Calming Program, and that is a separate process led by petition. So this is an issue, you know, that doesn't make a lot of sense to residents that there's a whole set of tools that are basically effectively put off to the side and not available except through a separate process.  So the whole goal with this resolution is to simplify the approval of projects that are part of the petition process. So we're maintaining that process, but we're also empowering staff to include the full range of established calming elements that come from NACTO and other respected organizations. For any projects that significantly disturb the road service and paying particular attention to roads that are part of the All Ages All Abilities Network that are identified in the transportation plan,  Roads that are in a school walk zone roads where a record of crashes speeding or resident complaint exists or otherwise suggest a need for calming to enhance the comfort and safety of Folks in on the street regardless of petition status Sorry, I'll stop Further discussion Councilmember breaks"}, {"start": 10538.362, "end": 10682.785, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "text": "Yeah, so I'm happy to answer any questions that may come up. This, as Council Member Ackman mentioned, has been a process that's been going on for quite some time. The Transportation Commission approved starting the subcommittee in August of 22, and the subcommittee started meeting in November.  and I think we anticipated that it might be a little bit of a quicker review than it turned out to be. I would really like to thank staff for engaging so thoughtfully with us on this and how many staff members actually participated in this process.  There was a lot of back and forth and a lot of making sure that we really understood kind of what the implications might be of making certain tweaks, making sure we're not overextending certain programs to  achieve other goals. So anyway, this is taking neighborhood traffic calming, putting it more as an administrative function as it should be. Traffic calming projects will still, of course, the contracts will still come to council for council approval, just like other contracts. But what we don't need to be doing is having staff have to come to us every time there's a tweak in the program that they want to make.  And we know that this is a highly popular program in our city of other things that I get calls on and request for more of it is traffic calming and I have to tell folks to wait in a long queue. And so this.  We're sort of addressing that piece of things But we're also making sure that we begin integrating it with the other capital improvement projects that we're doing so that when we go in We assess that Street and identify. What are the appropriate staff identifies? What are the appropriate tools for being able to? address concerns that have come up in that neighborhood before and instead of directing them to a program that's gonna you know, maybe not be something that happens for three years or more  So I think that this is something that is very much in line with the goals of our transportation plan.

This resolution is aimed at making it easier for everyone to monitor Annapurna's progress towards adopted goals, compare ourselves to peer cities, and find relevant data and reports. Many city departments are clearly quite committed to sharing data, but it's often scattered across the website and hidden under project subpages or different city initiatives, and our approach to performance monitoring isn't consistent across the organization, and we're often missing critical information that helps us monitor progress towards adopted goals.  So since we're in the process of redoing our website right now, it's an ideal time to address this. We just received the equitable community engagement report. This resolution directs the administrator to do four things. One, review municipal best practices and performance management and open data. Evaluate the city's current approach to data access and performance management. Develop an exemplary centralized dashboard that provides residents with an easy access to key performance indicators, community indicators, and open data.  And then finally, develop an accessible and standardized approach to performance data reporting across all city departments to enhance the visibility, accessibility, and monitoring of policy goals and key performance metrics. Department websites should include standardized public dashboards as well as an access to open data, maps, and more detailed regularly published reports as relevant.

Elected in 1974 as a member of the Human Rights Party,  Kathy Kozichenko is a trailblazer in queer history, and more broadly, the history of our city and our nation. I have had the incredible privilege of connecting with Kathy several times now. And while she remains an incredibly humble person who has generally shied away from the spotlight since leaving council,  She acknowledged her historic accomplishment in her 1974 victory speech when she said, quote, this is the first time in the history of the US that someone has run openly as a gay person and been elected to public office. Gay liberation was not a major issue in the campaign. Both candidates in this ward said they supported gay rights. But 10 years ago, or even three years ago, lesbianism would have meant automatic defeat.  This year, we talked about rent control, we talked about the city's budget, we talked about police priorities, and we had a record of action to run on. Many people's attitudes about gayness are still far from healthy, but my campaign forced some people to at least re-examine their prejudices and their stereotypes.  Kathy's election helped pave the way for thousands of openly LGBTQ elected officials in the decades that followed her election, including my own and those of at least 1,185 LGBTQ plus out elected officials currently serving in the United States today. Until recently, with the help of increased visibility from national organizations like Victory Institute and the Human Rights Campaign, Kathy's story was not well known. And historically, we as a city have not done a very good job of telling it.  Next year is Ann Arbor's bicentennial, and because it conveniently coincides with the 50th anniversary of Kathy's election to this council, it is a perfect opportunity for us to rectify this. This resolution, to begin the process of erecting a statue of Kathy Kozyrchenko on City Hall grounds in partnership with Statues of Equality and seeking a complementary state historical marker, is, in my view, an exceptional and long overdue way for us to formally recognize Kathy's place in history,  and to celebrate the impact her election had on the broader LGBTQ civil rights movement.

She was the first openly gay candidate to be elected to office in the United States, elected by the people to represent the second ward on Ann Arbor City Council in 1974 as a member of the Human Rights Party. Her story is incredibly powerful and it is an instruction in courage.  Though her work remains unfinished, it is right that during our bicentennial, we honor her and we express our righteous civic pride in the fact that Ann Arbor is the home of her incredibly important accomplishment. In addition to that fact, the fact that we look to recognize an historic Ann Arborite, an historic individual, I'm delighted that we are poised to contribute to the increase of public statuary that honors women.  By some counts, less than 3% of public statues depict women. This condition denigrates the experience and contribution of women over the generations, and we as a culture need to remedy it. I look forward to working with Statues for Equality, a well-known organization of artists devoted to this purpose, to work with them to right this wrong here in Ann Arbor and to effect a glorious good, and that is to say to honor an accomplishment of a great Ann Arborite on our bicentennial.

So, you know, this is an appropriate resolution to bring right after Labor Day. For those of you who don't know, subminimum wage is basically an inhumane labor practice that was originally developed in the 1930s to give people with disabilities jobs to keep them out of institutions. It's the ability for employers to gain a waiver from the state through the Department of Labor called 14C waivers to legally pay employees with disabilities less than minimum wage.  It should be noted that it's not legal to pay underperforming employees under minimum wage. And it rests on the assumption that people with disabilities will perform inadequate work.  There is quite literally no limit to how little a 14C employer can pay an employee. As outlined in the resolution, more than 60% of 14C employees make less than $3 an hour, and 23% of those employees are paid less than $1 an hour. In Michigan, there are currently 16 employers with 14C certificates, and nearly 700 individuals being paid subminimum wage. Currently in Ann Arbor, there are no registered 14C certificate holders.  which is great, and this resolution is our statement that we strongly discourage employers from seeking these waivers in the future due to our city's commitment to fair labor practices and human rights. This practice also has real economic consequences for our state, considering people with disabilities have already experienced the highest rates of unemployment and poverty.  So this resolution is essentially seeking that our city administrator advocate to the state legislature to do what 22 other states in the nation, as well as dozens of others,  We're also beginning this process to phase out the use of 14C waivers by exploring and utilizing various programs called Competitive Integrative Employment Programs, also known as CIE. So I welcome any questions that anyone might have. And that's it. Hope you support."}, {"start": 11467.153, "end": 11471.176, "speaker": "SPEAKER_28", "text": "Further discussion of the resolution?

The person who's probably best equipped to speak about it is our city clerk, Jackie Boudry. She has spent a great deal of time educating me, so I'll try to do her justice. With the adoption of reforms in the state of Michigan that allowed an expansion to ballot access to  absentee voting and to early voting. The logistical challenges of administering an election in a city like Ann Arbor and across the street have become extremely complex. The majority of our voters vote by absentee ballot now. Before the reforms of 2018, most, if not all certainly, but the vast majority of ballots were cast at a polling place on election day.  and the counting and sorting occurred in those individual precincts. Now, the majority of our ballots are cast as absentee ballots, which requires a, like I said, very complex logistical operation to keep voter registration forms, which can now be filled out up to and on election day.  absentee ballot request forms, absentee ballots themselves, voted absentee ballots, all of the workflows and physical processes to administer these forms have to be physically separated from each other to keep these flows from intermingling with each other and getting mixed up. And they have to be separated by ward and precinct as well. And so it creates,  There's a need for an immense amount of physical space to properly administer an election in the state of Michigan now. Before 2018, all of that administration happened right here, actually, the clerk's office behind you and in this council chamber.  And it was easily managed. Over the last several elections, we've had to commandeer space outside of City Hall. In 2020, when the public schools were closed, we used the Huron High School gym as an absentee ballot count board space, 4,500 square feet.  It was a wonderful place for us to hold an absentee ballot count board, but once the schools reopened, we don't have access to a space like that in City Hall. So we are constantly kind of bubble gumming space together to make sure that we have a secure facility to process these ballots.  We've also had to commandeer city facilities to create high security ballot storage, which is not something we've had to do in the past. Every election, we have to change where that location is, which means moving a lot of cameras and re-keying doors and things of that nature. It would be ideal if we could have that in one space. We also have high precision, very sensitive ballot counting equipment, which is meant to be stationary.  But with our current operation, it has to be moved into storage and out of storage to ballot counting locations every election. And so it's important for us to really solidify a space for our election administration. As our elections have changed, as, you know, threats to our elections have changed over the last eight years, it's become very important for us to  change how we interface with our election processes as well and kind of modernize how we do things and bring them up to a you know 2024 standard."}, {"start": 11967.981, "end": 11968.542, "speaker": "SPEAKER_28", "text": "Councilor Song."}, {"start": 11971.486, "end": 12121.596, "speaker": "SPEAKER_06", "text": "I was actually on the Executive Committee for Prop 3 back in 2018, so for folks who want to travel back in time a little bit, Prop 3 basically authorized automatic Election Day voter registration, no reason absentee voting, straight ticket voting.  and allow basically what our military and overseas voting folks experience when they vote here. And it was so timely given that the pandemic followed shortly after.  And just lowering those barriers to access to vote is supposed to ensure a stronger democracy. And then with Prop 2 passing this past fall, we know that voter turnout, well, we hope, and I hope I think all of us will try to help increase voter turnout with this upcoming election. So I'm excited to see this project come forward.  We can follow what the governor had announced last week as part of her initiative for what's next I was at that speech and she spoke to Strengthening democracy as being part of her next plans and that includes supporting prop 2 last year with more early voting options and decreasing barriers but securing elections shoring up elections security is is her plan of action, so  The stars are aligning so that we can strengthen our democracy in Ann Arbor in a building.

So as we began identifying facilities for an election center, one of the physical attributes you need in a building is large open space. As I said, the absentee ballot count board we had in 2020 was a 4,500 square foot basketball court.  You know, in total, the space we need for the election center, I think we estimated it to be between 12,000 and 14,000 square feet, depending on the configuration. But it was difficult to find buildings of that size that also had large open spaces and didn't need a lot of structural work to open them up. And we realized that if we wanted a building with those open spaces, we need to think a little bigger.  and started thinking about other city operations that could potentially partner into this building, and CTN is a natural partner. You know, something the community may be aware of is a lot of people are cutting their cable cord, and our CTN, Community Television Network operation, is funded with PEG fees, which are fees that individual cable subscribers pay into our CTN fund.  As those revenues are declining, we need to find ways to operate CTN in a more economical way. Right now, we lease space. We believe that moving them into this building in a new studio that is purpose-built for maybe a different production future and different operational future for CTN also has the opportunity to save them operating expenses on their facility, potentially more than 50% savings in annual operating expenses.

Moving forward with threats to our democracy, with threats to election integrity, intentional threats to election integrity, and the increased administration cost of a welcome cost of increased absentee voting, increased early voting. The purchase of a structure for the purpose of, supporting our elections as a necessity. And I'm delighted that we are able tonight to move that forward. We're able to do so because we have a staff that has had the vision to note the need and to present it to us and to work incredibly hard to accomplish it. It also must be said that we were dealing with a partner on the other side who was not out to bring the last dollar out of a buyer. They were there understanding that the building was being purchased for a civic purpose and in a manner consistent with that they were approaching it with a civic good as an important factor of how they were approaching the issue on the other side as well. And I think it's important and proper that we express gratitude and appreciation on that as well. And so I do so. Further discussion? All in favor? Opposed?
