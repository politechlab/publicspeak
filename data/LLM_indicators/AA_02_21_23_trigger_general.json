I was a vendor at the street fair last year, and I'm here to speak in support of granting the street fair permit. I think it's important to remember the history of the street fair. The street fair started about 20 years ago to address a very real issue, and that issue was the lack of infrastructure at the Hash Bash. Specifically,  the ability to wash your hands, cleaning up afterwards, subsidizing the police and fire response, as well as just, you know, kind of generally cleaning up at the end, because they clean it up every single year. And that is something that  You know, I think the hash bash needs. The hash bash is going to happen regardless if the street fair happens. The hash bash and the street fair, in most people's minds, there's no distinction. It is one in the same. You take away the street fair, those 10, 15,000 people are still going to show up to the hash bash. Then the question becomes, if they're at the hash bash, they got to use the bathroom, where are they going to go?  And the answer is twofold. One, they go to the local restaurants and they cause a nuisance. And we know because there's a lot of complaints before the street fair about that. Or number two, I mean, they use the city as a sewer. And they go wherever it is convenient for them. And I don't think that's good for anyone involved.  I do want to also address the public safety concern. Because that was brought by the police and it was brought by fire. And I believe it's unfounded. I believe not having the street fair is actually going to cause public safety concerns. Because you have 10,000, 15,000, 20,000 highly intoxicated 20-somethings. And if we don't close off those streets,  I'd rather have them in the streets without cars than in a street with cars because these people are not, you know, sober and they may not make great decisions. And I think it would be a lot better for everyone if we did close off those streets. So what I'm saying is, if you deny the street fare permit,  I believe it's going to cause the very issues that the city and fire are saying are going to happen if you actually grant it. It's going to cause public safety concerns. It's going to cause nuisances to nearby residents. It's going to cause a big mess that the street fair isn't going to be around to clean up this year. And, you know,  It's bad for the community. I mean, it's something where people are going to need these services, and they're going to go to hash bash. So then the question for you is, are you going to allow them to have it, or are you going to deny the permit, and people won't have a place to go to the bathroom, wash their hands? And so for those reasons, I'd suggest you grant the permit."}, {"start": 679.143, "end": 832.325, "speaker": "SPEAKER_03", "text": "Hello. So the people of the cannabis culture community, whether it's medical or recreational, have spent and lost too much time in their homes hiding, in a car, behind a building. There isn't many events besides the hash bash over the years leading up to legalization.  This is one of the places where it's like a family reunion. We all meet family, friends, we talk about what's going on in the community, what are we gonna do for the next year, and how are we gonna structure the legalization, the recreational, and the medical all together to come together. A lot of the cannabis money that's given to the state of Michigan and to Ann Arbor  is from these stores. These stores are going to be on the Monroe Street Fair. They're the ones there supporting and giving them, the people, the community, education, the knowledge. I come from a place where I had a family member hurt in a car accident, filled him with drugs from the hospital.  If it wasn't for cannabis, this person wouldn't walk. So we need to be able to have a place where we can all meet and rejoice and, shoot, have a place to get together. Ann Arbor has always been the structured place. I've lived here for 40 years. This has been the place. Whether there's a permit or not, like this gentleman said, the people are coming. And there's nowhere for them to use the bathroom. Simple things that have to happen, except for on the Monroe Street Fair.  And boy, I've been there every year. The crew comes out, cleans up everything, and it's in perfect condition. I, over the years, have never seen where the police had more than good interaction with people at both events, which really, truly is the same people walking from one to the other.  the police are very friendly and really don't have anything to do besides watch all of us. So I don't believe the conflict of this football game in April in the mud is gonna be a conflict with this problem that we're having here. It should be a no-brainer that Ann Arbor was the one.

Everybody heard of the thing about  If you don't remember the past, you're bound to repeat it. And I would like to explain a little bit about what happened to us about 50 years ago in Ann Arbor and in the Ann Arbor City Council. When my husband, my ex-husband, John Sinclair, got out of jail after two and a half years, he started  back where he left off before he went to jail, and that's promoting music, managing bands, and he organized the 1972 and the 1973 Blues and Jazz Festivals in Ann Arbor, which were a great success and set the standard for festivals all in the country in terms of booking. And comes 1974,  The composition of the city council changed and there were people in the city council who denied us the permit to have the next festival in Detroit.  which was devastating because we had already contracted for the musicians to appear and had invested a lot of money. At the last minute, Windsor, University of Windsor, allowed us to have the festival in Windsor, which was a great disaster.  and led to us having to declare bankruptcy and having to move out of Ann Arbor and move to Detroit. That was in 1972, 51 years ago. So I just want to say that please, city council, don't cancel this culture on us.  That is our culture. We've been fighting for it and now it's legal. And now you want to cancel it? No, please don't. Thank you very much."}, {"start": 975.741, "end": 987.011, "speaker": "SPEAKER_09", "text": "Thank you.

First of all, best wishes for better health for some of your colleagues who aren't able to be here this evening.  I'm here, though, because of the East Medical Center Bridge. I've ridden over the East Medical Center Bridge for decades now to get to my job, to get to meetings on North Campus, to get to the pool when my kids were smaller, to get to robotics practice, and yes, to get to the Songbird Cafe to meet with city council candidates. I ride my bike across that bridge, but nobody else I know does. I don't know if any of you all have ever ridden your bikes across that bridge, but it's  Not good. I don't blame anyone who doesn't do it today because it wasn't built for people like me to ride a bike across it. It was built by your long ago colleagues for people to drive in cars and buses across it.  And so, of course, that's what people do today, because the decision they made 40 years ago that we were going to ride in vehicles across that bridge has haunted us for 40 years. And I say haunted, because I do ride my bike across it. And it's not safe today. It's not safe to cross across the lanes. It's not safe to ride in the lanes of 35 mile per hour traffic. But I've never come and complained to any of you about that, because I know that we can really only afford to rebuild bridges at end of life.  end of life, like Broadway and Stadium once were, where when we rebuilt them, we made sure they met multimodal needs. So I, you know, sucked it up, told my family I'd be careful, not to worry, that I would come home at the end of the day and gone out day after day over that bridge.  And now, the bridge is at end of life, and so you all get to rebuild it. And now is the time. Now is your time to make a change. It's the time to make that choke point welcoming for cyclists, especially those who, unlike me, are too intimidated today to ride across it. Perhaps some of you feel that way.  It's 12 minutes to North Campus. Not one of my U of M colleagues that I know of has ever ridden their bike to North Campus. Besides me, I'm sure there are some. They're just not common, at least in the offices I've worked in. I know that fixing this bridge won't fix the whole route, but you can't fix the whole route today. But this is your only chance to fix this choke point. Because now is the time, and it's the only chance in what's left of my lifetime.  So I'm frustrated to hear that the plan for it is no dedicated cycling infrastructure. Let me repeat that. No cycling infrastructure.  The current plan is for cyclists, like me, to ride in the road. Or to dismount in the center of the road with the traffic around us and haul our bikes up onto that sidewalk. A sidewalk where there is no room for us, even as guests under our policy, because the pedestrian traffic is so heavy.  There's no way that the new e-bikes that I'm sure you all are excited to hear may be coming to Ann Arbor can safely ride in that sort of traffic of the sidewalk today without endangering the pedestrians. I hope that means I have 30 seconds left. Okay, I have old closure. It was really great. Thank you everyone.

Wow, we have lots of people really dedicated to cannabis. My vote is cancel this ugly orgy. This town does not need cannabis orgy. Cancel it. It's a source of embarrassment. But there's other things that are sources of embarrassment for people in Ann Arbor, and that is that our city council  has for a very long time, while pretending to be anti-violence, they have been allowing murder of Palestinian people in the hands of a racist apartheid state that is Israel.  I have come here for 20 years and I will continue to come because it is an embarrassment to this community, to this town, when every human rights organization in the world has declared Israel to be a violent, apartheid state. This city council continues to refuse to listen to the thousands who have been coming here since 1980s.  to say at the very least, pass the resolution, that we are against military aid to Israel.  This city council wants you to believe they're against violence. Wants you believe they are against gun violence. We have come here all these years with gun violence across the United States, happening almost every day. And we have said, if you are against gun violence inside the United States, you should be against gun violence outside the United States, especially when United States funds it.  United States gives Israel $4 billion a year, and guess where that money goes? To the slaughter of Palestinian people, particularly children. This poster depicts Ms. Iyer, who received  support from friends of Israeli Defense Forces. And now she makes faces at me, and she refuses to hand out this poster, which I handed out. And she says, we don't want your racist cartoon. This cartoon is not racist. It's depicting racists in Ann Arbor, which is Ms. Ayer, along with everyone else here, who refuses to take one step  to protect Palestinian people from the violence that the United States, with your tax dollar, is unleashing on them day in and day out. If you think police violence in America is bad, if you think mass murder  on the scale that you see in the United States, which is large and very, very sad, is bad.

You've heard me before, and you may recall from our previous communications, speaking on behalf of Bike Washtenaw, that we'd like to see two things on the bridge. Widening the west sidewalk to about 15 feet to make room for bi-directional bike lanes and a pedestrian lane, which would also serve as part of a campus-to-campus bikeway, and building the planned trail loop under the bridge, which would also be a part of that bikeway. We think it should be straightforward to resolve MDOT's concerns about that.  Now the proposal before you, as I understand it, would call for restoring some or all of the sidewalk space that was taken away in the earlier plan. I have some questions about that, and I'm not sure what the answers are. Is most of the cost of that due to an added beam being needed underneath and abutment support for that? And if so, how many feet of added sidewalk space could we get for an added beam?  If I understand the engineering drawings correctly, both about our current bridge and the planned future bridge, the current beams are about just under six feet apart, five feet, 11 inches, and a little bit more. If that's the case, then we could get approximately six feet of additional sidewalk space by adding a beam. So it'd be good, if this is true, it'd be good to verify that, both council and staff, to find out if that's true, and that may open an opportunity to widen that west sidewalk.  As you know, the city and university have carbon neutrality plans. The university's plan calls for a bikeway between North Campus and Central Campus. This facility could serve as a part of that bikeway.  Ann Arbor's A20 plan calls for a reduction of vehicle miles traveled by 2030 of 50% in Ann Arbor and 25% of trips by walking and biking in Ann Arbor by 2030. Now whether or not you think these goals are achievable, at least it would be good to work towards these goals.  This bridge gives us an opportunity to make progress towards these goals and an opportunity in one of the parts of town with some of the heaviest bicycle and pedestrian traffic. This bridge is a major long-term investment. It's important, we think, to do it right and not to make a $10 million mistake.

My immediate family has taken five degrees from the University of Michigan, so we're familiar with the surroundings. When my wife and I were married here in 1953, do the math,  We went to Hawaii to raise our family. And when we retired from Hawaii in 1993, 30 years ago, we thought about California and Oregon as places to retire.  But we came to Ann Arbor. We found that we had been spending our off time in the summers trading houses with people in Ann Arbor. And they loved to trade houses with somebody who lived in Honolulu. So we settled in Ann Arbor 30 years ago, and we bought a house on the west side. And we have really enjoyed living here.  But in the recent years, we have had some misgivings about that. And I'd just like to raise a couple of issues. Our quality of life seems to have been declining here.  And one of the reasons we found was that there is traffic congestion now. There are more potholes as a result. There are high-rises going up, and there are vintage houses and vintage trees coming down to accommodate them. We find that the city council is really instrumental in this because they're offering gift  well, gift offerings of numerous sorts, but mainly of rezoning properties so that they can be developed upon. And in the long run, we have a feeling that the city council is really instrumental in this.  We have read recently in the New Yorker magazine that the city of Austin in Texas has made its city council into an instrument of profit making for developers and contractors.

So to start off, I found it interesting that at the last meeting, former council member Griswold spoke at public comment, among other things, expressing concern that reworking the plans for East Medical Center Drive Bridge to include adequate pedestrian and bike accommodations might add $2 million to the project cost.  And in some ways, I find this concerning too. But let's take a moment and consider why this is and how we got here. Nearly half of the estimated cost, not counting the contingency fund, is for a rework of the engineering plans that were completed over the last year. This means that had the previous council, including Council Member Griswold, as well as a few of you,  actually chosen to aggressively pursue a design that adequately accommodated all transportation modes, much of this additional cost could have been avoided. Or to put it another way, if we had had the current membership of city council a year ago, it might have saved the city and the university hundreds of thousands of dollars in a year of delay on this project. Better not for hypotheticals.  Main point is we should not fall prey to the sunk cost fallacy here. We will, as previous commenters said, have to live with this bridge for generations. So it's important, and it is worth paying the cost to get it right to the greatest extent we possibly can.  So I do want to offer sincere thanks to some of the folks on council and to Mr. DeHoney for this time standing up for the state of values of the city and getting us this far. Speaking before you in December, I characterized the previous bridge design as a capitulation. Now at least we can say it's a compromise. But it really is just that, a compromise.  We are compromising our city's goals and values by allowing a roadway to be widened to increase traffic volumes, speeds and potential conflicts. When we have adopted plans and objectives to do the opposite, we have objectives to reduce fatalities and serious injuries to zero and to cut our city's total vehicle miles traveled in half. We cannot do this. We cannot achieve any of this if we're going to keep on widening roads.  So in case you can't tell, I'm not exactly happy with the plan that's before you tonight. But I also recognize that this might be it, right? So my ask for you is first, please continue to keep a careful eye on transportation needs in the wider vicinity of this bridge, in the Fuller East Medical Center intersection. It's a critical linchpin in multiple biking and walking routes through the city.  There's a redesign of this intersection potentially coming down the road, so to speak, one which could be even more disastrous for these safety and sustainability goals if we do it wrong.

What you're deliberating tonight has been characterized as a bridge project, but at its core, it is a road widening. Widening a road, whether or not it adds lanes, increases the speed of the road. Faster driving means exponentially more human injuries. And of course, inviting more injuries contradicts your Vision Zero commitment to zero deaths and serious injuries by 2025. The discussion highlights three things that should be worrisome to anyone concerned about road safety.  One, you're debating among choices that will increase car speeds. Two, these choices made their way through staff to your packet in the first place. And three, this is just the latest in a series of examples of how your Vision Zero commitment is somehow not being communicated to or carried out by staff. Recent examples include the Lower Town Mobility Study, a tremendously expensive study that, despite referencing Vision Zero and carbon neutrality, was described by staff as addressing car congestion and was largely car-focused.  Platt Road. The plan to resurface Platt was going to leave it as a dangerous four-lane road. Thankfully, you directed staff to correct this. Huron Parkway. Staff recommended and you approved the resurfacing of Huron Parkway that also keeps it four lanes, maintaining highway speeds through a high school crosswalk where children have been injured. Just like with Platt, please direct staff to correct this. The Fuller and Maiden intersection. Designs were circulated last year that showed adding turn lanes and slip lanes.  How is it that any staff or consultant resources are being used for this? A Vision Zero approach might start by questioning why Polar Road has four dedicated car lanes in the first place, not how to widen it. And now the bridge. So we see a pattern. Why does this keep happening? Why wasn't staff's first instinct to remove lanes on this bridge or add cycling infrastructure? The traffic volume on the bridge is about half of that of South Main Street, where we removed lanes and saw dramatically reduced speeding. Was it U of M's money?  Is any amount of money worth endangering everyone using a road or its sidewalks? What if U of M offered $5 million for a redesign of Fuller and Maiden Lane so they can ram through thousands more cars to their new parking structure? Despite what U of M wants, the Cars First mentality in City Hall needs to end now so we can move forward. My request tonight with the bridge, specifically, is for you to direct staff to create a new design that removes the car lanes and increases the bike and pedestrian infrastructure.  In the broader picture, I ask four things. One, reaffirm your commitment to literally zero deaths and serious injuries by 2025, not fewer deaths and injuries than most of Michigan. Two, direct staff to do road diets by default, so proposals like this never come before you again. Three, remove regressive policies like the so-called neighborhood feedback veto process for sidewalks, traffic calming, and removing parking.  And four, institute other Vision Zero friendly policies like a roundabout first policy and prohibiting the use of car level of service and staff analysis. You're going to spend about a billion dollars over the next two years. Please follow the lead of many cities in the U.S. Thank you. Zero commitment.

I wanted to address some of the concern that had been or some of the concerns that has been raised with these events. This is based on our experience. This is something that we feel there's an obligation as the public safety officials for the city to be bringing this forward. What we want to avoid is and after the fact of  you were aware of concerns, those concerns weren't voiced, and then there's criticisms of police or fire for response times and our ability to respond. And that's principally our concern. It's not so much the matter of staff, it's the ability to deploy staff. Last year, we ran into this same  of the three events with the Spring Game, Hash Bash, and Monroe Street Fair. We had concerns going into it, and those concerns were realized. Speaking for fire alone, we had four incidents specific to this event, and our units from the downtown station, their turnaround time was over an hour for each of these events, which is normally a half hour call, tops, being on scene.  So the principal concern is our ability to get staff in and then staff out, and we struggled with just singular medical events, which are to be expected for any crowd of this size. If there should be something that is of more significant magnitude, either a fire incident, EMS incident, where we need to get numerous resources in,  We would absolutely be struggled with that. Excuse me, that would be an absolute struggle, and there would be rightful criticism of our agencies for that. The other concern, too, is this is something that is a very real issue that we deal with on game days, is our ability to get units from Michigan Stadium to the hospital has to go through a downtown network that is less than ideal. And that is a struggle that we deal with with every fall for home games.  We've had repeated conversations with U of M Public Safety, HVA. That's a known factor. We have some contingencies for that. But at least on the football games, we don't then have this block in between the hospital and the stadium. And this event is pretty much right in that area of the strategic pathway.

I understand the history of this event. I've worked many of these hash-bash events as a much younger officer. And I definitely appreciate the camaraderie that we have with a lot of the people that attend these. It's never the mass, it's a few bad actors.  But what I can say is this is the one event that we do have some control over in this city in terms of granting a permit. And so when we get gridlocked downtown, as Chief Kennedy stated, it is nearly impossible to get in, should we have a large-scale event, or get out, should we have one in another area of the city that we can't get to with enough staffing. So we are not asking for this event to be canceled indefinitely.

And so I understand what you're saying.

So I would first like to thank Ann Arbor Human Rights Commissioner Kida Cohen and also chair of the Washtenaw County ID Task Force for helping to lead us writing this really important change.  And I'd also like to give a little bit of background about why it's so important. The state legislature in 2008, they created a bunch of policies that made it difficult for individuals to obtain both federal and state IDs if they didn't already have one.  And not having one means that you could not also apply for things like housing assistance, to nursing homes, open a bank account. I'm hopeful that the state legislator will be working on this and changing these. But since we've been receiving reports at the Ann Arbor Human Rights Commission that there are some retailers in Ann Arbor who are not recognizing IDs like the Washtenaw County ID.  So essentially this resolution, or I'm sorry, this ordinance would help to ban any of that discrimination from happening to any Ann Arbor resident. So retailers would have to accept any form of a government, a valid government issued ID. And it'll be better for our community as well, because people will be able to access resources they need.

I know that we have had considerable work on this over a period of several months, and they have  put in a lot of work to make sure that this can move forward. And I know that also included talking to some retailers, one in particular, Meijer in the community, who folks had expressed some concern about getting Washtenaw ID accepted. And Meijer actually responded. We reached out trying to see if there was something we were missing, if there was something that perhaps we were unaware of that would prohibit them from taking a local government ID. And they actually responded positively that they were going to train their local employees to make sure that they were accepting it.  And so I think a big piece of this is really just continuing to educate the community. And I think this is that next step. So thank you. And I also encourage support. Any further discussion?

So just to catch people up, we've postponed this item a couple of times so that staff had time to gather information in response to questions from council as we discussed an amended resolution that staff brought forward in January.  The resolution was the result of Administrator DeHoney reopening discussions with the university so that we could collaborate on a new design that creates more space for people walking and biking in this area. In our discussion at the last meeting on this topic, I and others talked about the importance of providing a safe, comfortable experience for people that are going to be making use of both the West and the East pathways.  To provide that sense of separation from the vehicle lanes, I put forth an amendment asking for barrier protection and we postponed the vote in part to get information regarding both the costs as well as the kinds of standards that guide the placement of such a barrier.  So staff looked at two types of barriers. One was a low concrete barrier, similar to what you see on Broadway Bridge today. And the other was a more modest and less expensive handrail barrier. Because of the need to be crash-worthy, the only viable option is the concrete barrier. And due to site distance requirements, that barrier could only go on the east side of the bridge, which is the side that is today least trafficked by people walking and biking.  Additionally, we learned that the cost of installing this barrier on one side next to a sidewalk of 10 1\u20442 feet, the width that we want at a minimum, will cost an estimated $1.04 million.  Lastly in terms of the standards that guide barrier placement we learned that from a safety perspective The barrier is not providing additional safety that is over and above the raised sidewalk and the distance for the length from the lane So for that reason I want to move to amend the resolution Before us by striking from the second resolved clause the phrase barrier protected Has been moved is there a second?"}, {"start": 4665.124, "end": 4684.394, "speaker": "SPEAKER_09", "text": "councilmember ire Any discussion of the amendment?

And to be clear before I finish my remarks, I support infrastructure projects. And I know that projects like this create jobs, especially union jobs.  I want to recognize the tremendous amount of staff time that has gone into this project. I respect Mr. Dehoney and the city's incredible team of professionals. I value U of M and its contributions to our local economy. From jobs creation to investment, the university is an incredible asset to our city. I want to highlight several observations based on the information that I have received and analyzed as a result of the debates and additional information from staff.  The bridge design, in my opinion, is flawed. We know that wider roads are more dangerous for everyone. We know that wider roads result in higher impact speeds when collisions do occur, and as a result, crashes are more severe. This design does not align with Ann Arbor's Vision Zero policy adopted in 2021.  On our own website, the city commits to a Vision Zero goal to eliminate fatalities and serious injuries resulting from traffic crashes by 2025. The Vision Zero plan specifically cites major streets, have more lanes, more travel volume, and higher speeds.  As a result, major streets like East Medical Center Drive are only 25% of the total streets in Ann Arbor, but they witness 89% of severe and fatal traffic crashes. That is significant. While we are maintaining pedestrian infrastructure with this project and are hopeful for the opportunity for an added bike path at some point, we aren't gaining non-motorized infrastructure to keep bicyclists and pedestrians safer with this design.  There is no question that the bridge needs to be rehabbed, but a lot of questions around why it needs to be widened to only meaningfully accommodate more car traffic. I can join my colleagues in appreciating that the university and the city have shown a willingness to both contribute to this process. This is a project that directly benefits the university.  It is my sincere hope that this shift towards working collaboratively with the city is reflective of the university's desire to be a good partner to our government and citizens, and that it will result in long-term better communication and connecting the goals of the universities with those of the city. Working together, we can create opportunities that benefit everyone and advance our collective shared values. I also want to thank all the people who have taken the time to reach out about this project.  Noticeably, the majority of input I received was to urge me to not support this project. This feedback made me reflect on every interaction I had while campaigning, where I promised that I would prioritize infrastructure to make roads safer for everyone and also make our citizens feel more comfortable biking or walking versus hopping in a car out of fear. I think we can all acknowledge that this project is not ideal.  And at the same time, acknowledge that it won't advance our infrastructure to where we aim to be. And if we take Vision Zero into account, that's in just two short years. While I understand compromise is important and necessary in every factor of life, I cannot in good conscience compromise on this issue when I know that it will result in a more dangerous roadway in our city. This decision was incredibly difficult, but I will not be supporting this resolution."}, {"start": 4909.958, "end": 4913.76, "speaker": "SPEAKER_09", "text": "Thank you. Is there further discussion? Council Member Ekman."}, {"start": 4914.473, "end": 5037.397, "speaker": "SPEAKER_21", "text": "Yeah. So I want to start out also by thanking Administrator DeHoney for working with U of M to reopen this conversation. The plan that we had before added car lane while giving no additional space to cyclists and pedestrians, and that just was not acceptable. The result of these conversations with U of M is agreement from them that we'll gain back the space that was going to be removed on the west side of the bridge, while the east side is still being widened to at least 13 feet, and the university is paying the bulk of the additional cost.  a design that will provide safe pathways for people walking, biking, and using other mobility devices through this important gateway from the north to the center of our city. I want to be clear about where we're at today. Unless we go back and accept the original design for the bridge, this project's going to cost an additional $600,000 alone in redesign costs. That was a cost I was completely ready to bear to do a rehab-only project if we could not get the additional non-motorized space.  Rather than paying $600,000 in redesign costs to get zero additional space for people walking and biking,  we now have the opportunity to get pathways that better support non-motorized mobility than we have today, and with the university bearing most of that additional cost. But as I said, and I think that, you know, we're hearing from other people's comments, from the public comments, this piecemeal process around the design of this bridge has been frustrating to say the least, costing time and dollars that could have been saved had we approached this from the start with our shared carbon neutrality goals and the city's transportation policies.  So I think it's critically important that as we begin projects, we have to start with Vision Zero goals, transportation policy, and the A20 policy. From the start, we need to design for the future we have articulated as our city's vision and that residents have been vocal in saying that they want. This is something I've begun working with staff on and plan to continue working on so that our engineering designs and plans and our public engagement centers around the values and goals of our transportation plan, safety, mobility, and accessibility for all."}, {"start": 5040.685, "end": 5044.731, "speaker": "SPEAKER_09", "text": "Thank you.

I'm not a mind reader. But I think this is the final design that we have here is not anybody's ideal. And for me, voting on this tonight, I'm forcing myself to reflect on where we were on this a year ago, which was a very different place.  you know, and not just on the design of the bridge itself, but on our ability to work through some issues with U of M. I think we are in a much better place, both with the design than we were last year, but also with  asserting our goals and values and holding firm to them and coming to a compromise that, while not perfect, is  again, much closer to our stated goals than what we were faced with a year ago. This was not easy to, you know, the easy thing would have been to kind of throw up our hands and say, okay, well, you know, what happened last year happened and we'll just move on with it.

It took a lot of time for several council members to work through these negotiations with the university. I do appreciate that the university came back to the table.

DC3, a resolution in support of common sense gun safety laws to reduce gun violence and gun deaths in Michigan. Moved by Council Member Dish, seconded by Council Member Watson. If I may, I'm going to start us off on this one.  Our resolution is already out of date tonight because as of the start of this meeting, there have already been 81 mass shootings and 6,025 victims of gun violence in the United States since January 1st. I'm sad, I'm frustrated, and I'm angry that we are again discussing the need for meaningful action to prevent gun violence. I was in middle school in 1999 when the horror at Columbine happened.  It was then the deadliest high school shooting in history. I still remember being gathered in our library that year waiting for the all clear when copycat threats were called into our high school just up the street. I remember hearing then that this would lead to a change in our gun laws, but the following year politicians failed to pass even the most modest gun safety measures.  I was in college in 2007 when Virginia Tech happened, and I still remember thinking how this could have been our campus, our classrooms, how it could have been us. But nothing changed.  I was actually working in the legislature when Aurora and then Sandy Hook happened in 2012. And I still remember sitting at my desk, crying, and later thinking that at least finally something was going to change because we couldn't possibly be the country that allows dozens of elementary school children to be massacred in their classrooms and still fail to have the courage or decency to do something about it. And still, nothing.  I remember gathering in Broncourt in 2016 after Pulse, knowing that the only safe havens for many queer people around the country would never feel quite as safe again, and still nothing.  I remember sitting in my hotel on a business trip in Miami just a quick drive away when Parkland happened. Nearly two decades after Columbine, a new deadliest high school shooting and nothing has changed. In fact, the only major national gun laws that had changed since Columbine expanded access to guns and inexplicably shielded gun manufacturers from accountability.  I remember the texts and phone calls I got after Oxford, where one of my high school friends and her husband now teach. Thankfully, she was okay, but the classroom door we kept seeing on CNN with bullet holes in it was hers. And still, the Republican majority in Lansing did nothing. So here we are again.  All of us still shaken and raw after another preventable act of gun violence, this time just up the road at MSU, where all of us have people we love, especially some of our colleagues here at this table. This is not normal. This is not okay. We are not okay, and we have to do something about it.  We've invested more time and energy into training an entire generation of Americans on how to survive a mass shooting than into actually preventing them from happening. We finally have a legislature and a governor who seems willing to act, but because history keeps repeating itself until the bills are signed into law, I am too afraid to hope that this time things will be different.  But it must be different. And that's all this resolution says. It calls on our state government to act, and the modest protections mentioned in this resolution should be a starting point. Because safe storage laws, universal background checks, extreme risk protection orders, protection for domestic violence survivors, and a restoration of local control over firearms are a starting point, but they are not nearly enough.  Michigan has only enacted 12 of the 50 most effective gun safety laws. So we have work to do because every subsequent act of gun violence is a political decision and a policy failure. And it's unacceptable and unconscionable to fail on this.  The time for meaningful action to prevent gun violence was decades ago, but we will settle for now because now may prevent next time. We owe it to the decades of victims and survivors and their loved ones. So I am begging for this time to be different. I ask for your support. Thank you. Is there further discussion?

I don't think it's a secret that I'm a proud Spartan. MSU is not only the first place that I went after leaving home to go to college, but it's also my husband's place of work. And he also instructs a class there. So we've been quite shaken by the shooting that happened there last Monday.  One thing that I've been thinking a lot about this past week is how all gun violence leaves a wake of pain and trauma behind it. The family and the friends of the victims, the community whose sense of safety is shaken. In this case, the thousands of students that spent hours on Monday night locked inside their dorm rooms and classrooms wondering if they were next.  I'm particularly shaken by this event because it's personal, but I'm also really angry that we allow ourselves to live like this, that we have allowed the public health crisis of gun violence to run rampant such that kids don't feel safe in places of learning. We know the reason for the number of shootings in this country.  Numerous studies have shown its access to an astronomical number of guns. More gun ownership corresponds with more gun murders across a number of dimensions, across among developed countries, among American states, among American towns and cities, and when controlling for crime rates. What is more, a recent analysis reveals that gun control legislation tends to reduce gun murders.  So as my colleague said, it's way past time for policymakers and legislators to do something. And I'm honored to support this. I hope that Lansing is listening. And I thank Councilmember Rodina and Councilmember Harrison and everybody that worked on this resolution.

So I believe that when we talk about gun violence, we need to talk about the trauma of systemic poverty and systemic racism in our country. We need to talk about the lack of mental health care, the lack of social service supports, and general lack of a safety net. We need to understand the racial disparities that exist in the criminal legal system and how there's a potential overlap between these disparities.  I also want, you know, and this is not comparable to what many of even my fellow colleagues have experienced in terms of gun violence. But in 2013, I had two gunmen get in my car and put a rifle to my face. And it was very traumatic. It was very painful for me for many years. But I think the most traumatic was I found out that they were later killed by police officers.  And they were young. And I don't know what trauma probably brought them there, but I'm sure it was the trauma of so many things in our society that we don't fix and that create inequity. It probably got them to that place.

I just want to thank you for that amendment, but I also want to look to the methods that we've seen here in our community. In the county, there's been an initiative for violence interrupters that is designed to kind of forge more community connections and help prevent gun violence before it gets to the point of incarceration.  So, hearing Mayor Pro Tem Radina speak, I had something prepared with the exact same touch points. I mean, I remember leaving an exam in 2012 and hearing about the shooting at Newtown and at Sandy Hook Elementary School.  I remember thinking that maybe this would finally shame the nation into acting classes of elementary schoolers killed. And it saddens me that another generation has to go through this, has to have this specter of mass shootings hang over their education. And my heart goes out to the students of Michigan State, the families and friends we have, and those around this table who have deep connections to East Lansing.  Um, you know, it's hard not to feel cynical, and I don't begrudge anyone who says, you know, why would now be the time?  there is a new day in Lansing, there's a new State House and State Senate, and we do have a unique chance to see results. And I just wanted to point people to the many opportunities that you have to raise your voice on gun violence in the coming months. One will be a rally tomorrow at 6 p.m. on the Diag. Another will be a rally at the State Capitol March 15th, where we'll be joined by  Gabby Giffords, and then another, a day of action on gun violence, March 22nd. So if there's any time to get up out of your seat, if there's any time to maybe shake away the feelings of cynicism that, I don't know, sometimes it maybe even makes me feel like not wanting to get out of bed in the morning.  I think now is the time to really act and just find those places to gather, find those places to voice your support and contact your representatives.

In 2018, there was the Stoneman Douglas.

Having to go to school and do those mass shooter drills. I mean, that's traumatizing in and of itself. When Stoneman Douglas happened and I saw the kids on CNN coming out and speaking so eloquently, that was when I thought, okay, this is gonna change someday and it's gonna be those kids that do it.  And the fact that we now have a democratic state legislature is because of that generation, that generation that has said, I've had enough. They came out, they went to the polls, they voted in record numbers in November. And I am cautiously optimistic that it's going to lead to a change in gun safety laws in Michigan.

So I just want to kind of touch on a couple of things. What I think it's really important for us all to understand is that  Gun violence disproportionately affects the black community, largely. And as I'm looking for my notes here. It's very difficult. I apologize.  really I should, I guess, share. I think everybody might know this, but so in 2020, and I think 2020 was mentioned in one of the whereas clauses, there were  45,222 deaths that were a result of gun violence. One of those deaths was that of my oldest son. Monday, November 2nd, 2020, the day before the general election in the state where he resided, so he was not able to vote.  again, was a victim of gun violence. So I really tried to put some notes together for this evening, but I think I just really want to illustrate and sharing that with you all. I think you're aware, but some that are watching may not know that about me. I appreciate you supporting the change.  And I would have liked to have a little bit more time, I guess, to provide meaningful input. But that kind of is illustrative of a bigger problem that I want to talk about, and that is that gun violence kills black people more than anyone else in this country.  gun homicides are on the rise in the United States with young black and brown people experiencing the highest rates. And we can see that in our county, the eastern most part of our county. And for the gun violence that has occurred here in Ann Arbor recently, that has largely been retaliatory of the violence that's happening largely on the eastern most part of our county.  We have to be intentional when we have conversations about policy solutions. We want to make sure to bring black people into discussions about policy solutions around this epidemic. It's very important to me that we have people in the room and at the table. I mean, I've experienced, obviously, losing my oldest in a way that I don't want anyone else to experience, and I'm here at the table, but I'm just one person.  So I just want to make sure that we all understand that it's very important that we have voices like mine and individuals that look like me sitting at the table helping to develop policy. You know, when that death, every time we have a death due to gun violence, it represents a policy failure. And so we need to do better.  Could probably say a lot more but that's what I can think of right now. This was very retraumatizing for me you know over this past week and so I Just it's really important that we bring the voices that are being affected by this most Make sure they have seats at the table Thank you, thank you councilmember any other councilmember dish"}, {"start": 6629.044, "end": 6641.967, "speaker": "SPEAKER_14", "text": "I just want to be added as a co-sponsor and I want to thank my council colleagues for all of their thoughtful words and their hard work to bring those to the table."}, {"start": 6641.967, "end": 6643.908, "speaker": "SPEAKER_09", "text": "Council Member Watson."}, {"start": 6643.908, "end": 6651.89, "speaker": "SPEAKER_17", "text": "I neglected to mention that I too wanted to be added as a co-sponsor, so I'll do that now."}, {"start": 6651.89, "end": 6679.483, "speaker": "SPEAKER_09", "text": "Any further discussion?

Union at A2 would provide 250 affordable homes that would serve households with an average household income at or below 60% of the area median income. And thanks to an earlier item that we passed without discussing, which was, I think, fine that we did that,  this project will be able to serve everyone from the lowest part of the, you know, the lowest AMI range up to 80% as long as the overall income, sorry, level is 60% in the project as a whole.  That's why we didn't want to discuss the previous thing, because it's tongue-tying. Um, I am happy to, to, to be able to say that the Annex Group, which is developing the housing, will apply for low-income housing tax credit from the state of Michigan to finance the mortgage on the property, and that our resolution  exempts the developer from property taxes in lieu of an annual service charge equal to $1 for each eligible housing unit as long as the housing project remains affordable housing and as long as they have a state or federally supported mortgage loan outstanding and unpaid on the project. So we by a previous action enabled this to be passed and we will see an addition of 250 affordable  Housing units and that is great and it's an example of something We want to encourage more of which is the private market to get into this work that we are doing also Ourselves through the Housing Commission and our affordable housing millage.

None of that.  You have exerted so much effort to make sure that there's no debate of this simple seven-word resolution. We are against military aid to Israel. While Israel keeps gunning down Palestinians, Israel keeps bombing Palestinians down to the ground, and it has effects that are felt right here, even in Ann Arbor. You cannot find a Palestinian who isn't terrified to publicly bring up the subject of Palestinian rights. It's because of you.
