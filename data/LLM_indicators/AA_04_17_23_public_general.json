The Council of Commons was created in 2020 to advise this body and help plan the creation of a public park on the library lot. What it's become is a dysfunctional, deeply divided body that's neither advising you nor effectively advancing that project.  The latest example of this is on your agenda tonight. That's a nine-page memo prepared by the city administrator, requested by the Council of the Commons on the viability of permitting food trucks on the library lot. Asking city staff to analyze whether food trucks are viable on the site is, to be clear, a desperation play.  It's the best option among bad options to activate a site that everyone understands to be undesirable. This is something they proposed back in 2021, and to quote one member, they just needed a win. The logic of using food trucks to draw people to gather on an unimproved parking lot has it exactly backwards, and there are a lot of reasons for that.  But it also won't work. A 10-year-old Parks Advisory Commission report explained to us, again, 10 years ago, why. The site doesn't have foot traffic. It's boxed in on three sides. And it needs infrastructure to function properly as a public space. Council Member Briggs, you will recall asking the library director at the Council of the Commons meeting in December about food trucks and activating that site with that activity. And he responded that they've had food trucks on that site.  And they're not profitable. So this isn't a hypothetical. We've tested this. The libraries put food trucks out there. They've had to subsidize that activity. And that's the conclusion reached by the administrator. But the dysfunction of this body goes deeper than that. The last Council of the Commons meeting, the members were discussing a draft design RFP that isn't ready to issue despite two solid years of planning. It's badly overdue. It hasn't been socialized with city park staff. And it was attacked most of the meeting by a member of the council.  who spent an eight-plus-minute diatribe attacking it that survived inexplicably multiple points of order by other members. This council has outlived its utility to the public, and unless it's given a deadline to wrap its work up, it's going to continue to flounder. It's going to bicker about the terms of this RFP that it's never going to issue, and then it's going to attempt to justify its own existence by making work for city staff.  pass a resolution suspending the work of this body effective June 1. Give them a month of runway to wrap up their work. Then let staff and council members who have been supporting this activity patiently focus more of their time on actually meeting pressing resident needs.

Anybody who has been watching him act knows that he has, he is the, he has most hatred for Arabs in this community.  Mayor Christopher Taylor has more hatred for Arabs in this community that can ever be described. For this city council and Mayor Christopher Taylor to pretend they like Arabs is like a gangster boss sending flowers to his victims' funerals.  Mr. Mayor, do you recall a few months ago, January 2023, when Arabs of this community protested and chanted, not a penny, not a dime, no more money for Israel's crimes? Do you remember those Arabs, Mr. Mayor, for whom you have declared your love?  Arabs in this community have for decades come to these chambers, have chanted, stop Israel, boycott Israel, do something about Israel. They are murdering us. They are torturing us. They are killing us.  And you, Mr. Christopher Taylor, have silenced them with the silence that you have created. You have supported Israeli crimes against Arabs. Those are Arabs they are killing in Palestine.  Those are Arabs. And Mr. Mayor, your behavior has exhibited the most outrageous hatred towards Arabs in this community. When you said that you care about community issues, when you were asked about Palestinians, you said this city cares about the community, excluding Arabs from this town. Well, there are many Arabs here, Mr. Mayor.  and you have silenced their voices. By the way, do you remember in 2021 when 3,000 Arabs, do you hear me? 3,000 Arabs showed up outside this building chanting the same slogan we have here, no more military aid to Israel. They were right outside of this building, Mr. Mayor, and they were Arabs.  those that you claim to love. And you have choked them. You have silenced them year after year, year after year.

Last October, I addressed council about the Ann Arbor School's compliance with Public Act 170, which mandates teaching of the Holocaust.  Since then, the school board was kind enough to provide me the requested information. I addressed the board last week and hoped that we were molding Ann Arbor students to become independent thinkers. I addressed council tonight with the same concern. The textbook used in our schools is World History Patterns of Interaction.  In the section on the Holocaust, our student first reads, the Nazis proclaimed that the Germanic peoples were a, quote, master race, end quote. I think we're all accustomed to that phrase. But I note that there's no attribution to that quote, no reference. Which Nazi leader said those words? There's no way for the student to know.  If the student were equipped with books that challenged that claim, such as Benton Bradbury's The Myth of German Villainy, he could read that no Nazi ever said those words. And if the student were encouraged to do so, he could download a copy of Mein Kampf by Adolf Hitler and could scan for Master Race. He won't find it, and he may be puzzled by the claim.  He may even conclude that master race was merely wartime propaganda in which all sides took part. On the same page, our student reads that the beginning of the Holocaust targeted Jews due to German failures. Some Germans even blamed Jews for their country's defeat in World War I, as if nothing could be further from the truth. But Alice and Weir's book, Against Our Better Judgment,  documents clearly that during that war, when Germany was about to defeat Britain, and had actually offered a negotiated peace, Zionist Jews engaged in the process of getting the U.S. into the war on Britain's side.  Prominent American Jews like Louis Brandeis and Felix Frankfurter worked behind the scenes to accomplish this task and were in fact successful at getting the Americans into the war, which ensured Germany's defeat. So what is ridiculed in the text our student reads is actually the true historic accounting of events.  I encourage the board, as I do counsel tonight, to provide our student with enough information to make up his mind independently and critically about historical events, and that he be provided with an array of viewpoints, not just one. Thank you."}, {"start": 5003.348, "speaker": "SPEAKER_19", "text": "Hi, my name is Eric Ivanovic and I live in the Third Ward. I appreciate this opportunity to speak before you tonight to talk about the center of the city. It's now approaching five years since Proposal A was passed and the sad truth is that we have very little to show for it. The request for proposals is still being worked on. The space has still not been activated in any meaningful sense.  City staff's analysis of what it would take to activate the space with food trucks and mobile vendors is damning, and the director of the Ann Arbor District Library has been very clear about the inherent challenges of using that space for library events. If and when the results of the RFP come in, any project approaching the drawing shared by Proposal A supporters will come at a cost of millions, or more likely tens of millions of dollars, and there is no source for that funding.  The ballot proposal included no funding component, and when Proposal A was on the ballot, the key supporters and organizers of the initiative assured us that city taxpayer money would not be required and that private money would flow in. Yet, it's taken us five years to finally put together the comparatively little funding just for the RFP.  I am therefore asking City Council members to take a hard and honest look at where the project currently stands in contrast to what the public was led to believe and the opportunity costs of allowing this process to continue. The people of Ann Arbor deserve better.  It's painful to think of what might have been. We could have had much needed housing. We could have had one or two floors of retail behind the plaza to create traffic flowing through it, making the space a space where people feel safe and relaxed.  In other words, we could have activated that space. We could have had a public closet that was privately maintained, and our city could have had revenue from the 100-year lease, from new property taxes, and from running a portion of the parking structure beneath. And our city's kids might have even had a seasonal splash pad and outdoor ice skating.  Please, take that hard and honest look and act boldly and realistically and find a new path beyond Proposal A to reinvent and activate this space. I believe the public would appreciate the chance to weigh in again, this time five years wiser. Thank you."}, {"start": 5154.825, "speaker": "SPEAKER_15", "text": "Thank you, Council.  My name is Greg Woodring. I'm the president of Ann Arbor for Public Power, and I live at 1012 West Cross. I'm here today to ask for one small addition to the budget that was just proposed by City Administrator DeHoney. Very much appreciate your excellent presentation on that.  The council may remember that back in January of 2022, the council approved a feasibility study into municipalization as well as some other energy options. That study was funded in September of 22, and it's going to be finishing here in about June of this year. We do not know the results of that study yet. However, if that study is positive, the next step would be to get a valuation of DTE's assets.  Ann Arbor for Public Power is suggesting that we reserve some amount of money in the budget to pay for that study should we decide to do it. We originally proposed $500,000 for that study. However, after talking to other communities that have done this study, they believe that it'd be considerably cheaper than that. So we're amending our proposal to $250,000 reserved to get a hard valuation of the assets.  What that valuation will do is it will help with the city's legal proceedings to be able to go to DTE with a good offer for the price of their assets should we decide to go through with the acquisition process. Mayor Taylor actually just gave an excellent interview where he outlined the process for moving forward with municipalization on state side. I'd definitely recommend all of you go and listen to that.

I've been a resident in Ward four since I moved here.  And I'm here today to talk about the so-called center of the city. The election where Prop A appeared on the ballot was the first election in Michigan that I was eligible to participate in. My parents raised me to be an active citizen, and I registered to vote as soon as I moved here and was eligible. I read all about, you know, the various elections happening. I read up about Prop A.  And I remember thinking, well, this is silly. It's obviously not going to pass. In particular, I remember reading a story, I think in the Observer, where they interviewed proponents and opponents of Prop A. And of the proponents picked were a couple who said that any building on the lot would block the view from their $500,000 condo. And I was really surprised when it passed.  However, I have sadly not been surprised by the complete lack of progress that the so-called Center of the City Commission has made. I recently saw a number of tweets about the work that wasn't being done at this commission.  people smoking and drinking during public meetings. Just last week, I was walking down Division downtown to meet a friend, and the only people I saw anywhere near that lot using it were people, were a couple of teenagers on skateboards, who were actually on their way to Liberty Plaza, because that seemed like a better place to be able to try and do, you know, kickflips or whatever.  City Administrator Dahomey's recent report outlining the many ways that quote unquote activating the center of the city as a place for  food trucks, was thorough, honest, and, you know, as a previous commenter said, damning. I would like to join several other commenters, both at this meeting and I think at others in the past, to ask Council to step in. I think that we would all, as Ann Arborites, love to have places to gather.  Senator, City Administrator Dahomey's description of a potential splash pad and community garden at the currently named Fuller Park, I'm sure has been met with lots and lots of enthusiasm. 30 seconds. But it's also backed up by actual planning and expertise, which the center of the city doesn't have. We need to put our money where our mouths are and use them for things that are important.

I sent this to Council as an email, but I wanted to call in and read it into the record. I read this astoundingly brutal, I might add, memo last night and was struck by three things. First, Proposal A was passed in 2018, and we're only now looking at options such as food trucks.  We're coming up on five years. Everything about the center of the city and Council of the Commons or whatever the correct style to refer to this is has had a lack of urgency. We are coming up on the bicentennial with nothing to show for it. The Council of the Commons is still working on putting together a design RFP after nearly five years. I watched the most recent meeting and it was a disaster with one member interrupting and monopolizing much of the discussion time with a list of 18 vague amendments.  Towards the end of the meeting, he appeared to, as our elders would say, toke up. Looking back on the minutes from previous meetings, it doesn't seem as if they report much back to council, and it isn't clear to me what they've been doing all this time. Second, $130,000 a year for food trucks, if we can even do food trucks with the poorly worded charter language Proposal A saddled us with, and if we can find operators willing to take us up on it.  And I'll just use the proposed ballot explainer text for this, quote, four, the charter amendment does not provide a funding source for the development, maintenance, or programming of a park and commons, unquote. We don't have money to put food trucks here.  Please put an end to this charade. Don't let it drag on for another year or five. Dissolve the Council of the Commons so they stop wasting staff time and the time of the two council members sitting on that body. They aren't seeming to act as an advisory body to council anyway, so I don't think we would be losing anything without their input.  Pass a ballot initiative that allows voters to fix the mistake of Proposal A. Either strike the language entirely or, preferably, modify it so that the space can be developed to provide a public plaza, housing, and money for city priorities, which could include affordable housing, climate, active transportation, unarmed response, debt service, et cetera.  I don't want this issue to still be hanging over our heads while we are supposed to be celebrating the bicentennial. It's time to move on.

I just like to add my name to the folks who've already speak and spoken about the center of the city tonight. I really think that it's time to re examine this and put a valid initiative to the voters to let us decide.  Once and for all, after everything that we've seen over the past four plus years, whether it's worth putting any more time, effort, and money into this broken initiative that we embarked on, ostensibly for a public plaza, but really to stop a development downtown. A lot of the supporters who remain after the development was stopped are still divided in purpose and scope.  Other than a small flower bed, maybe a handful of events over the four-plus years, this parking lot is much as it was, with no real plans to change it anytime soon. I think the city administrator's memo is correct, and I think his plans for the rest of the city sound really well thought out and wonderful, and in stark contrast to what this group has come up with. It's time to cut bait. There's a dawning recognition in our city  that we must adapt and change to meet the growing crises of climate housing. And if we're going to devote time and energy into something, then let it be that, not window dressing on a parking lot.  The only way to change the use for this lot now is by amending the city charter and putting it to the voters. And it's within your scope as our city's elected leaders to do just that. And I urge you to do it. Do it this year. Put a ballot proposal forward and let the voters decide. Either to maintain the status quo as it is now, or come up with a new, progressive use of this plot that is right next to  the bus depot near the library. Something better than a parking lot.

We've already done quite a bit for public construction with our new best value contracting policy. But in terms of private construction, the only avenues that we have are through the building permit process.
