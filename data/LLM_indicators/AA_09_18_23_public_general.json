I represent two creative companies, Treetown Murals and Brush Monkeys. We have been serving Washtenaw County and the southeastern Michigan for over 20 years, bringing public art and window art to different neighborhoods and cities. Today I'm here to talk about consent agenda number six for all of you. It's the murals that bridge project.  We are identifying two major gateways to our community, one being the Huron underpass over here and then North Main Street. North Main Street is actually where I got my start as a public artist. The painting there still exists. It's very much in need of repair. But we've used this foothold to bring this new project to the residents and visitors of Ann Arbor.  This project is not only going to restore the wing walls, but also the fascia beam. So this is the first time actually the metal overpass that goes over the roads will be identified for public art. And because of that, we need a right-of-way permit. We will be closing the lanes one at a time in order to access the fascia beam.  We have hired Northstar Painting to do the restoration of the overpass. And it wasn't until recently that MDOT told us that Treetown Murals, Watco, and Northstar are actually not eligible to file the road permit.  So we have had to lean on the city of Ann Arbor to represent this project for us. And thank you to those who have already cooperated immensely on city staff to get us even on this agenda today. This project was slated to start in July and here we are in September. So it goes without saying that we're kind of moving this as fast as possible, hopefully at least getting the restoration done and maybe the wing walls painted and hopefully the whole project before the end of 2023.  free.  Now this is a twofold project. So tying into the bicentennial of next year, we hope to do the restoration and new murals on the North Main. And again, creating welcoming messaging to people coming into our community is kind of the big overhaul here. So today with consent agenda number six, we're looking for approval from the city to kind of go through with this project that the city would file the row on our behalf.  And that we could just kind of get going with the MDOT approvals now. I also serve as a public art commissioner Here in Ann Arbor and we've never had to deal with this aesthetic enhancement criteria that MDOT is putting for us But it's also just a great kind of learning curve for future public art projects So this is probably not the first time you will see this on your agenda given that 2024 we want to do this again so we are looking to  have the city support us and moving forward with this project. So."}, {"start": 1117.055, "speaker": "SPEAKER_19", "text": "Thank you."}, {"start": 1127.214, "speaker": "SPEAKER_05", "text": "Hello, everyone. My name is Laura Russello, and I am working with Mary on the Murals of Bridge project. I have acted as the main fundraiser for this project as of now, and we have, through over 50 financial backers, raised enough money to complete the entire Huron underpass and overpass project. So we are ready to go.  I'm also a ward five resident, so I can see that underpass and overpass from my house. So I'm very excited about having a colorful mural there and for the people coming in and out of town to experience that as well. So we really hope that you will back consent agenda six tonight and in 2024 for the bicentennial that you will back the main street one as well. So thank you very much."}, {"start": 1200.479, "speaker": "SPEAKER_06", "text": "Hi, this is Alex Lowe calling in from Ward 3. A quick note on CO2 and Bicentennial Park. This is absolutely fantastic.  But I'd love to see some city funding going to improving the park and its non-car connectivity too. Many people come to that park from the other side of I-94, meaning they either have to take the pedestrian bridge from Mary Beth Doyle Park and then walk along Ellsworth, or they have to use the Platt Road Bridge, which has five lanes of speeding traffic on it, narrow, unbuffeted, and unprotected bike lanes, and narrow sidewalks.  Even just a lane re-striping to remove the turning lane from the bridge itself and provide buffers for the bike lanes would improve it tremendously, and there is even more improvement that I'm sure our engineers could come up with at the same time. I'd also like to continue pointing out that as a city, we're still underperforming on our goals.  Our progress on an all-ages and abilities bike network has been poor. Fully a quarter of our total planned sidewalks in the city remain unbuilt, and at our current pace it will take us another century to build them. We continue to wait for years for traffic calming projects, with the petitions for both CA4 and CA5 having been submitted all the way back in 2020.  We continue to have empty lots where it's not even legal to build a duplex because of outdated zoning laws and setbacks. And we continue to allow new construction with even more space dedicated to cars than to human beings. We continue to subsidize parking with underpriced or free government-funded parking provided all over streets all across town.  All of this contributes to automobile emissions, which are one of the largest forms of greenhouse gas emissions, not just in the city where it's even larger than the portions set aside nationwide, but in fact in the country and the world. If we're going to be serious about climate, if we're going to be serious about safety, we really need to focus  on getting our transportation. Thank you."}, {"start": 1362.836, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "text": "The resolution passed by Council two weeks ago to raise money for a statue of former City Councilwoman Kathy Kozuchenko is one of the more ill-conceived measures that I've seen approved in the 50-plus years that I've observed this Council.  I'm almost certain that among the members of council and me, I'm the only one who actually knew Kathy and witnessed the political events that took place at that time. As far as I know, there are no statues of any person in public view anywhere in the city of Ann Arbor. This is not a good time to start and this is not the right person to start with.  Kathy is to be honored for being the first openly gay or lesbian candidate to be elected to public office in this country. Note, Kathy wasn't the first person to be out while in office. That distinction is believed to belong to two members of this council who preceded her, Jerry DeGreek and Nancy Wexler, who came out while on council. She also wasn't the first openly gay or lesbian candidate for public office. That distinction probably belongs to the legendary San Francisco gay activist Harvey Milk.  Milk was elected to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in 1977. He was assassinated by a conservative member of that body within a year of his election.  Milk had run also as an openly gay man in 1973, before Cathy ran, but lost. He had the disadvantage of having to run and win citywide, while Cathy had only to prevail in the predominantly student and decidedly gay-friendly Second Ward, which is already represented by Nancy Wexler.  The resolution describes Kathy as a beacon of courage, but she disagrees. She said, I don't think I was brave because I was in a college town and it was cool to be who I was.  Nancy Wexler agrees. She said, in Ann Arbor in 1974, we had pretty much gotten everything we wanted for gay people by then. There wasn't really a debate over gay rights in her ward. So what were Cathy's contributions to the city of Ann Arbor besides this historical footnote? The resolution doesn't cite anything else that Cathy did except that she was an activist student at the University of Michigan. That covers many tens of thousands of people.  There are many other Ann Arborites who actually made major and lasting contributions to the life and history of the city who would be more deserving of such an honor. But in its 200th year as a city, Ann Arbor doesn't really need to start erecting bronze monuments to people. And if it did, choosing Kathy Kosychenko to be the first one isn't sound governance. It's pandering and virtue signaling. This action should be reversed."}], "public_comments_2": [{"start": 1778.733, "speaker": "SPEAKER_13", "text": "First, I want to address myself to the asshole who is fighting so hard to stop the statue of Kathy Kozachenko. Asshole. Kathy Kozachenko was a great woman.  Still is, although she's been out of politics for many years. Not only great because she stood for gay and lesbian rights when that was harder than it is now, but great because she stood loudly in this room, in this city council, stood loudly for Palestinian human rights. Bless her for that.  So yeah, I want to see the statute of her, even though this city council is airbrushing out her Palestinian rights activism, even though this city council is reducing her to a one-dimensional cardboard character. She was multi-dimensional and a human rights fighter. The one thing that this city council has fought for uninterruptedly from January of 1984 until now  has been to kill Palestinians. This city council has stood hard and fast against any Palestinian rights resolution, against any Palestinian rights resolution since January of 1984, right up to now, right up to now. This city council domestically has a policy  Domestic policy is to build on every available inch of land so much luxury housing for the filthy rich in Ann Arbor that everyone else is driven out because they cannot afford the rent. That's their domestic policy. Their domestic policy also is proclaiming themselves to be all about equity as they're turning Ann Arbor more and more lily white and more and more filthy rich.  It's a twin policy. Their foreign policy, and you can see they have a foreign policy, their foreign policy is to fight like hell to protect Israel as it keeps massacring Palestinians. That is their unchanging foreign policy.  This city council has fought. And there goes Jen Eyre. Of course, she's running out of the room. She took campaign money. Jen Eyre took campaign money from old friends of the Israel Defense Forces. And guess who just got appointed by this city council to oversee the police of Ann Arbor? An old honcho of the Friends of the Israel Defense Forces.  That shows, and city council was warned that that's a bad idea. Yet they did it without hesitation. This is a racist city council through and through."}, {"start": 1972.402, "speaker": "SPEAKER_14", "text": "Thank you. Good evening. This is Tom Stolbrick calling from Lower Town in Ann Arbor.

I'd like to talk about conditional zoning. I've written you  And spoken, the conditional zoning is complicated and counterintuitive. And I really wish we would have addressed it more publicly when we spoke about Southtown, where there was a conditional zoning. Unfortunately, council members, not all of you, some of you, chose to make disparaging comments about your constituents rather than addressing the meat of the arguments and the issues that were raised by those speakers at that meeting about Southtown.  That was unseemly. Unseemly. Where have we heard that word recently? When we were talking about conditional zoning at Lowertown, Lisa Dish used that word. After making some comments that were completely incorrect about conditional zoning regarding the third phase of Lowertown, she criticized people who were  proposing things for that project that they were hoping the developer might deliver on as unseemly things to ask for. Things like, oh, affordable housing, or sustainability in the form of further electrification. Maybe retail instead of a second pool, only half mile from Fuller Pool. I don't think those things were unseemly. You may differ in your opinion about it. But certainly, you were incorrect, Lisa, in your statements about conditional zoning.  because it was not the case that this was somebody applying for a project with conditional zoning. It was a developer who had already had conditional zoning put upon their property, asking for it to be removed. Very different. Let's get back to Southtown. There were a lot of meaty issues that could have been discussed, and most of them were not discussed. For example, we could have debated, discussed at the council table,  the non-primary residence short-term rental issue. Not too long ago, the city passed an ordinance banning those in residential zoning. Recently, more recently than that, in crafting the TC1 zoning, they were banned in TC1 as well. So we have residential zoning being converted to non-residential zoning, and in this case, Southtown, giving them up to 60 units  Are we giving a monopoly to this particular developer, or are we opening the door for more? That would have been a good point for discussion, rather than spending your time disparaging your constituents. I hope we have a better discussion next time.

My office is at 301 North Main proud member of the mighty 5th Ward I'm the attorney representing Andy and Julie Reif who own the property We're here today to request a rezoning from our 1c to office Andy and his family have owned that property since the 70s. There's a  Two lots involved. There's a small house and some storage buildings. Over the years, the ability to rent that for residential has become less and less attractive. And a few years ago, Andy moved his small commercial cleaning business in to the house. He has two to three employees.  And however, in 2022, the zoning administrator dropped by and said, hey, this is zoned residential. You can't have an office in this small house. So we've been working since then to address this particular issue. A key thing to remember, Andy,  and intends to continue using the building for his office. He has no plans to change the site at all. If there were ever to be a change in the future, there would need to be a site plan where issues of lighting, noise, traffic, et cetera, et cetera, would be addressed through the appropriate planning process. But he has no plans to change anything now and just continue running his very, very small business. The rezoning to office makes sense.  Both for Andy's use and also because in the zoning area it would act as an appropriate buffer between The residential uses to the west and the north and the very very busy commercial activity on the other side of Ann Arbor Sleen Road  particularly the gas station, which is immediately across the street and which has become increasingly busy over the years. We held the citizens participation meeting, addressed questions, we went to the planning commission, it recommended approval eight to nothing. And I'll just say there are two particular reasons why this rezoning makes sense. First, the city council's entitled to rezone property when there's been a change in conditions.  Number one, and then also number two, this change is consistent with the master plan. As has been noted, the change in conditions on why it's no longer appropriate for single family fronting on Ann Arbor-Saline Road, as opposed to the houses to the north, which all gain access from the back. They don't gain access. If you think about Ann Arbor-Saline Road in that area, all the houses to the, what should that be, northeast, they all,  their backyards front Ann Arbor Saline. They do not gain access from Ann Arbor Saline. In any event, there's been a change, a dramatic increase in traffic along that road created by the huge retail activity on the south side of 94 there. Again, I noted across the street an increase in commercial activity. It's really just no longer appropriate for single family housing.  Secondly, this change would be consistent with the master plan. As I mentioned, office is a zoning designation intended to be a buffer between conflicting land uses. And in this particular case, it would make a great deal of sense to shield the multifamily to the west and the residential to the north in a way from the more active commercial to the east.  It also is consistent with the sustainability element of the master plan, which envisions a higher level of density. The particular or activity, I should say, it's right on a bus line. It would be very appropriate for if it were to ever be developed, it would make more sense of the scarce urban land that we have in the city. And so we request that you support the request for rezoning.  And we're happy to answer any questions later. Thanks."}, {"start": 3950.865, "speaker": "SPEAKER_06", "text": "Hi, this is Alex Lowe again, Third Ward.  I don't find any issues with this. I would like to point out to the people who are here at the public hearing in opposition that there was time for people to speak during the planning commission for this as well.  So perhaps that would have been a better moment to speak about it and perhaps gain some opposition since they approved it 8-0. I would also like to say I'm not a fan of the office district in general. It would be really preferable if this were zoned according to  what we would like to see the city able to do with the space rather than, oh, this is an old zoning district that sort of meets our quick short-term desires.
