But, in fact, I am a cranky old woman who drives cranky old Volvos. One of which is cranky enough and old enough to have a headlight that is consistently out. I went to repair it. It went out again. I gave up at some point. It's been like that for a while. But you know what? I never get stopped. You know why?  First of all, I'm a cranky old lady. Second of all, they are kind of late-ish model Volvos. Third of all, there is a Harvard alumni plate on each of them that I very intentionally put there because my mama didn't raise no fool. I am black. I rarely get stopped.  But let's talk about the numbers because other people aren't so lucky. So the Michigan State Police itself studied itself in 2021. That data revealed that traffic stops conducted in daylight were 18% more likely to have Latinos and 11% more likely to have blacks as the subject of those stops.  A study in a neighboring state found that one-third of the stops for minor traffic offenses were stops of black and Latino drivers. They were stopped twice as often as white drivers and far overrepresented in searches in being handcuffs and in being detained. But the incidence of contraband or evidence was lower than that of white drivers.  So Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Seattle, Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, and Berkeley in California have all implemented policies to limit or eliminate traffic stops for minor violations. And I encourage the city of Ann Arbor to join them.  We can go down a list, you know, there are numbers and then there are names, right? Ty Nichols was pulled over and beaten to death for reckless driving. Daunte Wright was pulled over for an expired registration tag. Rayshard Brooks was shot to death for falling asleep in his car at a Wendy's. Gabriel Navarro was shot 17 times while driving. Sandra Bland killed because an officer said she failed to signal a turn.  And of course, Philando Castile, who, before the police finally killed him in 2016, had been pulled over a staggering 49 times for minor traffic violations. Between 2016 and 21, police killed over 400 drivers or passengers who were unarmed and were not being pursued for a violent crime. And an outside proportion of them, as we know, were black and Latino. And that's an average of one person per week.  Right? So a busted taillight is not impacting public safety, neither is loud music, or an expired tag, or a window tint. The overall crime rate for these municipalities who implemented policies...

My name is Brian Gerringer. I'm here to speak deeply in favor of the proposal to stop executing traffic violations, stops by police in the city, the Pre-Tax stops. Decades of research have shown that traffic stops have an extremely disproportionate impact on black and brown and poor drivers, while white people driving fancy cars are subjected to an entirely different reality.  In some cases, like we have read about in Ferguson, Missouri, this leads to an outright cycle of terror for young, often poor, black men. We must soberly recognize that while Ann Arbor is not Ferguson, Ann Arbor is not not Ferguson, either. In fact, a recent report from the Citizens for Racial Equity in Washtenaw County, the crew report is damning, and I quote, the breadth of the racial disparities crew documented and the impact in terms of punishment on people of color are so stark  that CREW presents this report to our community with a call for immediate action by those institutions responsible for funding, administering, and overseeing the criminal legal system in Washtenaw County. The report found that in the county, prosecutors charge POC dramatically more than white people and that POC get worse treatment in the court system. The blatant reality is that the more contact that black people have with police, the more this racial disparity and punishment will widen.  And although that sounds bad, these are in fact life-ruining sentences, and the ramifications of these decisions are extremely serious. Nothing would be a racist and evil thing to do in this case. I'm looking forward to seeing how crows will begin to peel back the layers of policing in this county, finding, I hope, more and more instances in which the harsh punishment of imprisonment, as well as more minor retributions, are increasingly unnecessary. While we're at it, I would love to see Ann Arbor use its significant power in the county to encourage all municipalities to stop pretext stops  And I deeply encourage you to open a line of communication with the county prosecutor's office as well. The prosecutor's website states that they will, quote, no longer prosecute contraband cases that arise in pretext stops. Specifically, the prosecutor's office will no longer prosecute possession of contraband crimes that arise from a factual scenario, indicating that a police officer stopped a person for a minor infraction, but where their real goal was to uncover evidence that a civilian possessed drugs or other contraband. Unfortunately, the current reality is that the SABOT office is still prosecuting pretext stops,  It's their opinion that this policy stated on their own website only applies in scenarios in which the stop individual goes on specifically to give consent to the stopping officer to search their vehicle. This further specification of that policy renders it utterly unaware of the scope of this problem. Let us all be clear in our demand from the prosecutor to execute the pretext policy as stated. Stop prosecuting contraband from pretext stops immediately. And while I'm here, I'd quickly like to mention that if I were an Ann Arbor City Council member,  I'm just starting to worry about the city's biggest landlord and client, the University of Michigan, being under investigation by its accreditor for faking thousands of grades. You all might want to check on that and encourage them to make some confessions to GEO. Thank you all very much."}, {"start": 2649.335, "speaker": "SPEAKER_45", "text": "Good evening. I'm Dr. Lisa Jackson, the former chair of Ann Arbor's Independent Community Police Oversight Commission. For years, I advocated for transparency and accountability in policing in Ann Arbor. I'm here today in support of the Driving Equity Ordinance sponsored by Councilmember Cynthia Harrison and others. I've been stopped for not taking my handicapped placard down soon enough after leaving a grocery store when my daughter was in a wheelchair. I've had colleagues who've been stopped for having a child's graduation tassel hanging with pride from their rearview mirror.  I don't believe that the police or anyone feel that either of these were a threat to public safety. I perceive them, however, to be a pretext by which to stop and interrogate people who look like me. When I discussed these issues with Chief Cox, and specifically the claim that some people are concerned about that tinted windows make police less safe, he reminded me that in Florida, Arizona, Nevada, and California, tinted windows are in regular use and they have not posed a threat to police.  maybe we can do an exchange program and send some AAPD to these summer climbs. I saw Amy here, so maybe we can do like a trade-off thing. After much advocacy and my working for over 14 months, as you guys know, to get accurate traffic stop data from AAPD, the Southeast Michigan Criminal Justice Policy Research Project, called SMART, has finalized a report of traffic stops in Ann Arbor from 2017 to 2019.  Data on 2020, which is the first COVID year, are being analyzed separately. I worked very hard, as you know, upstream on this issue because traffic stops are the number one way in which people come in contact with the police. Just as Michigan State Police found when they had researchers at Michigan State analyze their data, the SMART team at Eastern has found significant disparities in the way drivers are policed in Ann Arbor at every single dimension examined.  Non-white motorists are stopped and searched more frequently than white motorists. The largest disparities should surprise no one. African-American male drivers were stopped for equipment violations, such as a hanging tassel, over 200% more than would be expected by the data, and they were searched after such stops between 365% and 500% more than would be expected by the data.  Middle Eastern male drivers were stopped 81% more often, while white female drivers were stopped less than should be expected by the data. There are certainly other statistically significant findings. Overall, the antiquated processes by which police are allowed to stop motorists do not keep us safer.  Allowing, supporting, and turning a blind eye to police with the discretion to search people who look like me, Lisa Jackson, while letting people who look like Lisa Dish off with a warning, or more significantly, not stopping her in the first place, do not keep us safer. The city of Ann Arbor needs to live up to its progressive image and join Philadelphia, Los Angeles, and other cities who have relied on data to bring their cities into the 21st century and to decrease the disparities with which people come into contact with police by way of traffic stops.

A few years ago,  Our son was a student at Pioneer High School. He played on the basketball team. One Friday evening, as was our custom, his father and I went to the basketball game. We sat there and watched him play. After the game, we all got up and we left together. In the parking lot, we stopped and spoke with some other parents. Our son got into his old raggedy car and started home ahead of us down stadium.  Within 10 minutes or so, we also proceeded down stadium on our way home. When traffic light, I'm sorry, lights of a police car drew our attention, we looked over. Now this was a cold, dark night. And we looked over to see our son's car and our son with his coat unzipped and hands up like this standing on the sidewalk.  We walked over, we parked and walked over. At that time, by the way, I was working for the city of Ann Arbor in the city attorney's office. No, I take, yeah, or was I in the prosecutor's office? One or the other. In any case, I walked over, I said, what's going on? They said, who are you? I said, we're his parents. They said, we stopped him because he fits the description of someone who just robbed a store over on Broadway.  I said, what was the description? Young black man with a knit cap on. Did I tell you it was cold out? We said, we just left him at Pioneer High School. The officer looked at me and said, well, when we pulled him over, we smelled marijuana.  I'm not one to believe my children never did anything wrong. I went to the car. I said, you didn't smell marijuana. The officer says, oh, you're going to tell me my job? I said, yeah, I was trying marijuana cases when you were in high school. I almost said that. But I held back. Then they said,  Well, we found a weapon in the car. Weapon in the car? My son, because of the age of his car, had a rock. He would start the car up in the morning and it would cut off if he just left it. So he'd start up, put the rock on the gas pedal, and go inside to finish getting ready for school. Absolute everything wrong, not true. This is what happens.  It didn't matter to the police that night that my son, our son, was a National Honor Society two-time letter winner, an all-around good guy. That evening, he was a black man with a knit cap on. We strongly support the ordinance for equity in driving. Thank you."}], "public_comments_3": [{"start": 3513.399, "speaker": "SPEAKER_08", "text": "Thanks.  My name is Molly Kleinman, and I live in the fourth ward. I served for three years as chair of the Ann Arbor Transportation Commission, and I still sit on the commission, but I'm speaking tonight only for myself. I'm calling in support of C2, the driving equality ordinance. As an advocate for road safety and a transportation system that serves everyone, I'm strongly in favor of policies that reduce interactions with the police on our roads. I realize that might seem incongruous,  but consider that the American Public Health Association has declared police violence to be a public health crisis. There is extensive evidence that police and policing cause harm to black, immigrant, indigenous, queer people and other people of color, as does involvement in the criminal legal system. If we want our roads to be safe for everyone, that means we have to consider not only safety from traffic violence, but also safety from state violence.  Secondary traffic stops for things like a broken taillight, tinted windows, and loud exhaust do not make our roads safer. But tonight, we've heard a lot about the extensive evidence that they do disproportionately harm people of color. And we've also heard personal testimony about our Black neighbors' experiences with excessive traffic stops in Ann Arbor. Ending this practice will move us a step closer to the safe, equitable, and just transportation system Ann Arbor aspires to.  While I'm here, I also want to express support for DC6, the resolution in support of an RFP issuance for the unarmed response program. This resolution recognizes the importance of creating an unarmed response program that is run independently by a third party. This is a structure that is widely supported by both established best practices in these programs around the country and by members of our local community. I strongly encourage city council to pass both the driving equality ordinance and the unarmed response RFP issuance resolution. Thank you."}, {"start": 3718.472, "speaker": "SPEAKER_25", "text": "Hello. This is Adam Driskevich calling from the Fourth Ward. I'd like to talk to you tonight about two items on your agenda, DC2 and C2. First, I'd like to talk about C2, the Driving Equality Ordinance. I am delighted to see this on the agenda tonight, and I hope to see it passed into the second reading unanimously and without being watered down. Thank you to Councilmember Harrison for bringing this forward, and for those of you who have already signed on as co-sponsors.  As we have seen in many cases around the country, interactions with police can be dangerous, particularly for people of color. We are not immune to that here, and we have seen the data showing that even we have disparities in how often people are pulled over and the outcomes of those stops.  This ordinance change will reduce these interactions with police, eliminating many that are, frankly, unnecessary anyway. Traffic enforcement can and should be limited to driving behaviors that are actually relevant to traffic safety, speeding, running red lights, road rage, failing to yield to pedestrians, and so on.  I hope the Driving Equality Ordinance will be uncontroversial among Councilmembers, as some other important ordinance changes have been, and I would love to see everyone jump on board to co-sponsor this tonight and at second reading. I would also like to mention that I am glad to see us continue to move forward with the RFP for an unarmed response program. I am following this with a lot of hope for what we can accomplish here in Ann Arbor with this and other reforms like the Driving Equality Ordinance.  I would also like to support DC2, the federal building plaza on Liberty Street. From my reading of this, it appears that the feds are going to be moving forward with redeveloping this plaza, whatever council has to say about it. I think it's great that we might be able to influence what these changes look like, and I like the ideas presented in the resolution. Pedestrianized streets are great, and I really enjoy our summer open streets over on Main Street.  If we can get a pedestrianized block of liberty out of the deal, it would certainly make that block more pleasant to visit. And what better place to put it than on the same block as the Blake Transit Center near the William and Division Bikeways? While I rarely bother to bring my car with me when I visit downtown, I know many people do. So the fact that it is only a block or so away from three large parking garages should alleviate that concern. Please also pass DC2 tonight.

There is no difference than what happens on the West Bank when a mother or a father or a son or a daughter or a grandparent in their own country have to have a work pass to go past a certain point. There's no difference from what went on in South Africa before their racial reconciliation with apartheid. There's no difference.  for you to take and pretend or any of us to take and pretend that this was a long time ago. Whereas here, right now, it's still happening today. Right now, not yesterday.

My name is Alicia Dyer. For anyone who doesn't know, I served in law enforcement for many years. So I'll be speaking from that perspective about the traffic stop ordinance. I want to say thank you all that have worked on this, especially Cynthia Harrison, who  I know has put a lot of effort in this. Thank you, Jen Cornell, for co-sponsoring. And this issue is really important for law enforcement in a lot of ways. When I worked as a deputy on patrol in Washtenaw County, I remember pulling somebody over as a new recruit because their exhaust was loud. And in training, that was one of the stops that they told us that we could pull people over for.  I remember going up to the car and I remember seeing how scared they were of me because of this situation. And I asked him, I said, hey, I just pulled you over for your exhaust being loud. And then they went on very quickly to tell me how hard they were trying to fix their car and how they just did not have the money.  I remember walking back to my patrol car and sitting there wondering, why are we pulling people over for this? And then the hard pill to swallow of causing the trauma I did and pulling this person over for this offense. And I think that I now have a social work degree. And I think when we think about traffic enforcement, what we need to realize is it is a traumatic interaction for a lot of people in our community.  For law enforcement, when we pull someone over, that can be a dangerous interaction. And so we should minimize those interactions whenever possible. We should make them for safety reasons, but we should not be making them because of a registration sticker that got put in the wrong spot, or an air freshener, or a crack in the windshield. These things really hurt the trust that we are trying to build in communities.  And so the more that we can do ordinances like this I think are a step in the right direction to start reducing the unnecessary contact that doesn't really need to take place if it's not a safety risk or a safety hazard. I think that this will also help protect younger officers so they won't have to go through that situation I did on patrol and have to live with that trauma knowing that I caused harm.  And so the more that we can start restructuring our laws and our ordinances and what we have law enforcement do, the better we can actually have a community where people are not being harmed, not being killed, and not being injured because of our practices. And so I just want to thank you all for your work. I especially want to thank Cynthia Harrison. I know that you put a lot of work into this.

But their intentions here for this plaza redevelopment are clear. The resource is at the ready, and we should catch that wave and ensure that we get the best possible outcome for the city and its residents.  Specifically, I want to support the intent to use all of the adjacent right-of-way on Liberty Street for inclusion in this plaza. Unlike some more challenging public sites downtown, this site has the ingredients for successful and vibrant public plaza space. It has active uses facing multiple sides. It has terra firma for sustaining trees and other vegetation. It is open and transparent to the surrounding streets.  There will be logistical trade-offs and complications for the adjacent parcels and for those traveling through downtown, but those are small costs relative to the potential benefits this kind of space will bring. While I'm here, I also want to support passing CT2 to limit pretextual stops by the police and encourage your ongoing support for creating and funding an unarmed response program by passing DC6.  Whenever we use armed police to respond to community needs, we inevitably risk that resolution will come at the end of the barrel of a gun or other violent force. And it is marginalized people, as we've heard tonight, multiple stripes that suffer an unequal burden, and this is an avoidable outcome. So thank you for all of your work on this.  And lastly, I also support the passage of C1 at first reading tonight. We're in a housing crisis. We need more housing of all kinds. It's a high demand area to live. It's a site that sat vacant for far too long. The developer's plan comports with the zoning ordinance that applies to the site. There's no reason not to say no. There's no reason to say no to 200 additional homes, especially since it's coming with almost no parking. So thank you."}, {"start": 4403.529, "speaker": "SPEAKER_06", "text": "Thank you. Hi, Council. I'm the Reverend Donnell White and I live in the 500 block of Silo Church Road in the 4th Ward. I'm calling in to speak in support of the Driving Equity Ordinance C2. The majority of policing and police interactions with civilians nationwide occur during traffic stops. These are often civil infractions. But racial inequity is endemic in our criminal justice system.  And one key driver of those inequities is the so-called pretext or pretextual stop. These stops are made by police officers as a result of an observed traffic or ordinance infraction.  but they are really about an officer wanting to uncover evidence or to conduct a search. The data shows that black motorists are significantly more likely to be subjected to pretextual stops than white people, and pretextual stops are heavily associated with racial profiling.  As you know, your own Independent Police Oversight Committee noted during their update to Council on June 5th that this data isn't just coming from out there, nationwide. It's actually right here in Ann Arbor. According to the research conducted by the SMART Center at EMU,  that evaluated AAPD stop data from 2017 to 2019, it found significant disparities across every dimension examined. Black motorists are being stopped and searched in Ann Arbor more frequently than white residents. It makes it unsafe for me, a black resident, who is male, to drive in our city.  Now, what I've noted is you cannot train away racial bias. You actually have to change the underlying systems that allow racial bias to harm people like myself and other residents.  Anything else is a policy decision. It's a policy decision to support the ongoing racial bias that's embedded in our existing system. So I am incredibly grateful to Councilmember Harrison for taking on this important issue to ensure that I can move about the city freely. In addition, I want to offer my support for DC6, and I'm grateful that Unarmed Public Safety is moving forward in Ann Arbor.  I was heartbroken when I heard about Scott Fitzpatrick's experience when he called for a mental health wellness check, but instead watched his wife get arrested. They then incurred over $10,000 in fees and fines, and they have to live with the trauma of that experience for the rest of their lives.  This was a categorical failure of our community to care for each other. And so I'm grateful that the PSC Community Engagement Report affirms with the coalition re-envisioning our safety has already proposed over a year ago that public unarmed safety should be...

Thank you. My name is Glenn Wazorek. I'm the engineer at the Water Treatment Plant. I will be introducing CA-18 and responding to two questions. By way of introduction, sorry, thought you'd want to look at my face maybe.  By way of introduction, this resolution requests acceptance of a grant for PFAS treatment upgrades at the water treatment plant. More specifically, the grant program is called the Consolidation and Contamination Risk Reduction Grant Program, which will be administered by EGLE, Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy.  The grant amount is $491,122, to which we are proposing the design and construction of two filter upgrades to strengthen PFAS removal performance. The two questions proposed to me, CA18 question one,  It reads, since we're replacing only two of the lower profile underdrains, I'm assuming we still need to eventually fund the replacement of the 14 other underdrains that need more clearance to more efficiently filter PFAS. In the meantime, how are we addressing this issue? Are we actually running the water plant at a lower capacity, or do we have another way to remove the PFAS?  A response to question one, our current flows at the water plant are well below the plant's design capacity of 50 MGD. So the filters are operating well below their maximum capacity, but we don't want to restrict the flow as demand increases over time. It's important to note that we are meeting all PFAS  regulations under all current conditions. We are constructing these two filters to take advantage of the grant and to validate performance prior to investing in the remainder. But due to excess capacity, we have additional time where we'll likely be incorporating the remaining filters in a future capital project.  CA18 question number two reads, regarding the project budget, the memo says $1 million of the required $1.291 million for this project is included in the approved fiscal year 24 water supply capital budget. The EGLE grant is providing $491,000  Why does another $291,000 need to be appropriated? Wouldn't this grant bring us to $1,491,000 in available funding? There's a lot of numbers.

The water fund must front the full project cost. This is a financial accounting practice requirement. The water fund will be reimbursed the full grant amount of $491,000 when it becomes available.

Since its first reading two weeks ago, dozens of Ann Arbor residents have reached out in support of a potential humane pet sale ordinance in the city. As stated in the first reading, this ordinance is not unprecedented, as hundreds of other cities, along with some states, have similar restrictions on the sale of animals.  The main purpose of this ordinance is to prohibit irresponsible sourcing of animals from inhumane facilities and to encourage pet acquisition directly from reputable breeders or other responsible sources like shelters and rescues. These actions are proven to protect consumers, promote humane business practices, and contribute the overall health of pets in our community.

I will just let you know that these organizations have the heart of the commercial pet industry at heart.  They work from a monetary basis. They don't consider animal welfare at the source of what they do. And with that, I hope all of our city council members will make a decision that's in favor of animal welfare and not this pet industry.

I'm a third ward resident on Brooklyn.  No one condones the animal abuse, substandard kennels, irresponsible breeders. This ordinance does not address those issues. That being said, I have concerns with this ordinance. Seemingly, the Humane Pet Acquisition Ordinance has been a working process for quite a period of time before it was presented to council last session. As of Thursday when I visited several pet shops,  none of the stores had heard of the proposed ordinance. The three stores visited that sell live animals are all impacted by this ordinance. The point being all stakeholders should have been brought in early into the discussion, not just in this past week or two.  The ordinance erodes consumer protection. Under Michigan compiled law, MCL 281.3358, section 5, pet stores are required to have current pet health care certificates valid within 30 days from the sale of a dog or cat at retail. Shelters do not have the same requirement.  Pet stores also have certificates of origin for all their animals. The consumer will know what qualified breeder or qualified licensed kennel the dog or cat came from.  The ordinance shrinks consumer options with the goal of matching families' lifestyle with the dog's temperament. Random source dogs do not fulfill that goal. A 2017 study by the ASPCA and the study by the American Pet Products Association showed that 3.3 million dogs entered shelter. Meanwhile, close to 90 million pet dogs are in the United States.  The average lifespan of a dog is 11 years. The annual rate of death of dogs is close to 9 million pet dogs a year.  The ordinance plan is unsustainable. Over the past several years, shelters intakes have been going down. The demand for dogs have been going up. An MSU study showed that the proportion of households owning dogs is expected to grow from 38% of all US households to 45% in 2030. Shelters will not be able to come close  to the close to 6 million dog gap between shelter intake, getting a new family dog, and growing demand for dogs. Even now, some shelters are importing dogs from out of state to fill their kennels."}], "public_hearings_2": [{"start": 7205.5, "speaker": "SPEAKER_20", "text": "My name is Brad Moore. I'm with J.

The rezoning will provide for the reuse of an existing underutilized parcel and redevelopment of an antiquated building, a highly energy inefficient building, that is currently consistent with city policies to find more ways of accommodating more Ann Arbor residents.  Rezoning will provide for the redevelopment of the parcel with an all-electric building, an all-electric high-rise, first one in the city, that is also consistent with the current city desires for more all-electric projects.

I have lived at 1321 Forest Court for over 40 years. I am strenuously opposed to the application for a PUD project at 721 South Forest. I strongly support the thoughtful analyses of Matt Kowalski and the Planning Department staff to reject  this project. The proposed luxury student apartment building is totally inconsistent with the zoning of this site and the land use goals of the city's master plan. It significantly exceeds any density and building size permitted for this zoning district. It disregards the existing buildings around it on and adjacent to South Forest between Forest Court and Hill, a diverse and pleasant area of well-maintained residences, small apartment buildings, fraternity and sorority houses, and a child care center.  It contravenes the central area land use recommendations that seek to encourage appropriate development and transitions and to protect the existing character of neighborhoods. This project clearly does none of this, unlike the recently constructed small apartment buildings at 727 South Forest and adjacent to it at 1315 Hill, as well as the Towsley Children's House.  The proposal is in complete violation and makes a mockery of the zoning created by the City Council in recent past, establishing D1 and D2 zones with transitional step-downs to preserve the character and integrity of the R4C area surrounding.  It seeks to do via a PUD what the established zoning will not allow. Ignoring the city master plan and central area plans for this PUD is not how city planning is done, nor should Ann Arbor be remade through single-site spot zoning.  like this. This is precisely the only purpose of this request for a PUD for this project to circumvent the existing zoning of this site. I strongly urge you to reject this PUD proposal that is in total violation of the zoning and of the purposes of the Planning and Developments  Approval will only open the way for other such PUD proposals in the R4C zoned area between Willard and Hill and beyond, no doubt. I could support a newer apartment building of similar size to the current one on this site if this one is antiquated. I would encourage that it require affordable housing in this building, not just a one-time fee.  There are still D1 and D2 parcels on Southview, on Church, on Willard that have not been developed into student high-rise housing. They're still there, they're still available. There's all of the transit corridor TC1 rezoning that you've passed and that is being speeded along and has not yet been subject to dense development.

I am here to speak in favor of it here tonight. The site is immediately next door to another previously contentious high-density development proposal, Forest Plaza.  which nearly 100 years ago, was originally proposed as a luxury nine-story building on the street. This proposal triggered anti-development backlash, forcing the reduction of a building by four stories and forcing the building back from the edge of the lot. And it also led to further restrictions in our zoning ordinance that limited dense development near campus.  One of a few series of backlashes that happened through the history of the city that has limited housing. This PUD is a symptom of a problem that we began creating for ourselves 100 years ago. We have had the good fortune to live in a city that is home to one of the premier public universities on the planet, created and supported by the people of the state of Michigan. The significant public investment creates a natural demand for housing as closely as possible to campus.  This was true 100 years ago, and it remains true today. Our efforts to limit the ability to build and to meet this demand has created the reality that we live in now with scarce, expensive, often extremely low-quality housing to anyone who wants to live in our city. If we had allowed many more forest plazas as originally proposed 100 years ago, we would have avoided digging our housing hole yet deeper, putting further barriers up to substantial new housing  for subjective preferences or to reach goals that can't practically actually be realized right now, will contribute to our history of exclusion, contribute to our ongoing case of housing scarcity. So I please encourage you to approve this proposal tonight.  And I did describe this PUD as a symptom. There's other PUDs coming in the same area. I agree with the previous speaker. We're probably going to see more of these. And it's a symptom that something's wrong. I still think we should approve it because the housing situation is desperate. But I think we really need to be rethinking our zoning much more broadly. But we don't have time to wait five years for a comprehensive plan rewrite, ordinance rewrites, just to provide enough housing for the people who want to live here now.  And we know downtown, nothing new really has been built or approved since the recent ordinance updates a few years ago. We've put up all kinds of barriers. We have an unwritten rule book that we hear at Planning Commission over and over again of things we'd like to see that lead to rejections.  You know, all of which are goals I think we all share, but we're not getting what we want using the tools we've been using forever. And so I think if we want to actually get there, we need to start taking a little bit of risk, allowing some things to happen, and actually letting people meet the demand that is there.

I'd love to refute what Mr. Trudeau just said. If you look around downtown and if you look around South University, there is tons of new development. We have not been slow to develop recently. First of all, I hope that you will consider these things when you consider granting PUD status here. You're planning  staff and your Office of Sustainability both gave reports that asked you to deny the approval of the PUD. This should give you pause. You have experts on your staff who are saying this does not meet the requirements for a PUD. Their reports are well substantiated, and they give ample reason of why this does not have the public benefit for a PUD.  Any proposal to circumvent an existing zoning by use of a POD should give you pause, should make you think about the planning process and whether it's a valuable tool for a city to use.  These comments came up in the planning commission. A planning commissioner was asked, the commissioner asked the developer, if perhaps a change of zoning would be more amenable to the kind of development that he was proposing. And the reply was, it took too long to do that.  Thus the resort to a speedy alternative, a PUD that circumvents the zoning, that does not take into consideration the neighborhood or what the long-term plan for this neighborhood is. Another commissioner said, if not here, where?  Within walking distance of that site are some empty lots. There is an empty lot at Washtenaw and Observatory. There's something that's being used as a parking place across Washtenaw. There are alternative sites that don't require removing a relatively affordable student apartment building and putting in something that will be  both disregarding the nature of the neighborhood and will not be more affordable. So not sustainable, not affordable, not a public benefit. Please think about these things. We're about to embark on a new comprehensive plan, and so shouldn't we take that, take the slow step,  Sorry, but I think that in the long run, the slow step looking at a comprehensive plan is a better idea. I urge you to consider factors beyond adding density. One commissioner, one planning commission indicated that he did not see that this was a neighborhood worth preserving. It is in fact the very definition of a sustainable neighborhood. Thank you."}], "public_hearings_3": [{"start": 8296.505, "speaker": "SPEAKER_61", "text": "Hi, I'm Chad Brummett.

I won't repeat all the important points other than to say it concerns me that city staff, planning staff, had a thoughtful reply to this PUD to say this is not justified. Simply pointing to a housing crisis to say we need more housing and this housing really being intentionally for students, wealthy students.  The small buy-in to the affordable housing, we would be happy to see a more appropriately sized, truly stepped down, appropriately zoned building that was newer, LEED certified, that did all of the environmental things that you're interested in.  also included affordable housing, I would enthusiastically support such a building. Simply saying we need more housing for students isn't going to solve our housing crisis. Does this mean we can just put houses anywhere? I mean, put tall apartment buildings anywhere, right? As an owner, I am not savvy to zoning, right? That's why we have staff in the city who do this.  However, as an owner of a house, I do think that it's important for me to be able to think that the zoning that has been put out by the city as part of a master plan will be followed in cases like this. And I've been on all the meetings, and it was very quiet in the last meeting. I did not hear anything except for, we need more housing for students.

We're here for public comment, really important and thoughtful public comments have been made in opposition to this. And I strongly urge you to think about the fact that once this building goes up, it cannot easily come down, right? It's going to be there forever. It's going to shade homes, it's gonna change a whole neighborhood. And where does it stop?  And why are we ignoring all of the empty lots? There are many empty and open lots. We're ignoring them because we don't have a developer from another city and paid consultants advocating for one of those buildings. Those lots aren't being proposed for development, and we have buildings being finished. I've walked that neighborhood today, as I do most days, and I look at this and it doesn't fit. It's not a step down.  The area, the land is not being underutilized. And this won't really fill a need by itself. We need to be more thoughtful about how we use all of the space and how we think about putting appropriately sized buildings, including high rise apartments in the places where they fit, not simply shoving them into the neighborhoods in the name of a housing crisis. I really encourage you to think this through. This is a big decision. Once it goes up,  It doesn't come down, and there are many more behind it.

It's it's too late for slow steps. We're in a housing crisis. We are in a climate crisis. As I said about this proposal at Planning Commission, I'm confused why staff is recommending denial.  It is appropriate for the surrounding area and has a number of benefits for our city. This building would be within a couple blocks of several other buildings of comparable height and density in an area dominated by student housing and student bars and clubs. It's a block from Rick's.  We are in a housing crisis with a high demand for housing and not enough supply. This would add significant number of units to our local housing supply. That in itself is a benefit to our city. We are also in a climate crisis and again this development ticks a number of boxes. There have been a number of discussions around encouraging electrification or even banning natural gas. Well this development is fully electric.  We are installing solar panels so that some of the energy needs will be generated on site. They're increasing the efficiency of the envelope with extra insulation to eliminate thermal bridging. All of these are great and seem to be above and beyond what we require in the building code. Another benefit.  This location is easily walkable to campus and to local businesses that are frequented by students. It's right in the thick of things in terms of student living, so residents will likely not need to drive much. This is great because we are trying to cut vehicle miles traveled in half. This benefits our Vision Zero goals as well as our A20 goals. Furthermore, this building would pay $4.7 million into our affordable housing fund.  which Jennifer Hall and the Housing Commission can leverage into more wonderful developments like 121 Catherine, the old wide lot at 5th and William, and other projects coming down the pike. These benefits to the city seem substantial to me, hence my confusion. This seems to check all of the boxes. Please approve this rezoning and the site plan tonight.

The city of Ann Arbor is facing a housing affordability crisis. This means that we need more housing at all income levels, both market rate and subsidized.  And this project that is in front of you tonight would do a significant amount to address both of those needs. It would directly provide a significant number of units of market-rate student housing in a location that, frankly, I can't imagine a better one for high-rise student housing. It's two blocks from campus. It's a block from Ricks. Where else are we going to do something like this, right?  But also, as part of this project, there will be a contribution of, I believe the number was something like $4.7 million, the Affordable Housing Fund. This is badly needed. A couple of years ago, residents of Ann Arbor passed a millage to raise money to pursue a lot of very ambitious affordable housing construction projects.  That millage was never going to be enough to meet our ambitions. And this has gotten worse. Because of inflation, supply chain issues, and various other problems, construction costs for affordable housing have skyrocketed. I have seen, and I'm sure you have seen, many discussions, presentations, and memos from city staff speaking to this exact issue.  The city needs a lot more money in the affordable housing fund to achieve the goals that you have set out for it. And I'm not going to claim that this one project will solve all of that, but let me put it in perspective for you. $4.7 million is more than 70% of the money raised from the entire city or the affordable housing fund millage in a year. This would  This would get most of the way towards doubling the amount of revenue you would get for the affordable housing fund in a year. And by increasing the tax base, it would provide a permanent increase to the money raised by that millage and every other millage. So. 30 seconds.

I don't know how that works scientifically, but I just think that the idea that someone can say remove the air and then just get to completely ignore both the housing crisis and the impact on the environment that comes from sprawl, because here's the thing about people. If you don't build homes for them where they want to live, they still got to live somewhere.  And if they can't live where their jobs are, they spread out. And the ways that we get from one place to another, specifically in Michigan, are inadequately environmentally friendly.  I think that it's kind of just absolutely absurd for folks to be making stuff up and then trying to say that we should just flush down $4.7 million that can go for affordable housing down the drain on top of the housing that's super needed.

I live at 1312 Cambridge Road, Ann Arbor.  I would like to echo the others who spoke about denying 721 South Forest PUD. It seems like our zoning laws mean next to nothing now with all these exceptions for high-rises in neighborhoods where they do not belong. As others have said, this building was denied by staff for a number of good reasons. I want you all to think about the dangerous precedence that you are setting by approving these PUD high-rises south of South University.  I live half a block from a number of student rental houses on South Forest, a few blocks south of the 721 South Forest site in North Burns Park. And I wonder all the time, what if a developer purchased those rental houses on South Forest and applied for a PUD to build a high-rise there, just like what just happened on Church Street? My beautiful 1910 half-timbered house, which easily could have been featured in the historic preservation presentation earlier,  has been lovingly maintained at great expense to us over the years. Next door to a high-rise, it would become worthless. So would our quality of life. If my South Forest nightmare comes true, more high-rises will probably follow, destroying a longstanding historic neighborhood through the misguided notion that the city is somehow contractually responsible for creating housing for University of Michigan students. It is not.  I want each and every one of you to think about what you would do if this happened on your block or around the corner from your home. The way that this council prioritizes developers over neighborhoods shows a dismaying lack of respect and short-sightedness. Ann Arbor already has plenty of high-rise zones. That is where they should be building high-rises. It is simply unfair and wrong to grant these exceptions for these luxury private dormitories  that the city seems so obsessed with. They have not solved our housing problems over the last 15 years, and they won't do so now. The more you approve these high-rise PUVs, the more you will embolden developers to propose them in the first place where they do not belong.

And yes, the 733 bedrooms in this building would probably be mostly occupied by wealthy students that are attending the University of Michigan. And so if you say no to this development, you're saying no to those 733 homes, where will those 733 wealthy students go?  As our friend Ottawa County Joe pointed out, people have to live somewhere. And if you don't build the housing that they want to live in where they want to live, they'll live somewhere else. Are those 733 students going to decide, never mind.  University of Michigan is one of the best schools in the country. Maybe it was really hard to get into, but they didn't build this apartment building, so I'm not gonna come here. Of course not. They're gonna find the next best option, and then where do the people who would otherwise be living in those apartments go? And so on. So by saying no to this, we're excluding 733 people from our community that would wanna live here.  I mean, that's just the reality of how the musical chairs of the market goes. And we are also saying no to millions of dollars of affordable housing funding. Now, as Adam Goodman pointed out, that is not only the $5 million, but also the tax money over time.  that will support all kinds of things. What hasn't been pointed out is that money is always leveraged with other grants and funding sources. So every dollar we bring in that's unconditional like this into our fund, we can leverage multiple times over again. So it's not $5 million, it's $25 million or more.  that can be put to good use in all of the ambitious projects that we have lined up. So we'd be saying no to those people.

It can't happen. And if we demand things that can't happen, we get nothing. And if we get nothing, we know what the outcome is. What was the other thing?

I employ a lot of students. I'm a university faculty. I love our students. I care about our students. However, the idea that we should just willy-nilly put buildings anywhere because we need more housing for students, and the idea that a single housing unit is going to somehow solve all of the trickle-down effect,  It is just false.
