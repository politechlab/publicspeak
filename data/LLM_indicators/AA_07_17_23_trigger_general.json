While I'm glad to see that these parcels will be zoned R1D instead of the  ridiculous R1A district that essentially acts as a filter to allow only the ultra wealthy to live in an area. The fact that as a city we're still preventing people from building duplexes on their own property really saddens me. It's an indicator that, as a city, we still aren't taking seriously the goal of allowing anyone, not just the wealthy, to live here. I'm sure the move would be unpopular with our local landlords,  But most of us who live in the present and don't have a vested interest in exacerbating the housing crisis would support you in making it possible for all residential zones to have duplexes on them. Speaking of things that local landlords are likely to oppose, I'm excited to see CA9 come back onto the agenda in August.  I hope that when it does, it doesn't do what is effectively removing $6.2 million from the Affordable Housing Fund, as that seems like a bit of a negative side effect of this. Finally, I want to address sidewalk gaps and bike lane gaps.  especially in light of the recent death of someone who was riding a scooter in the space available to them and got hit and killed by a motorist. We need to make non-motorized transportation more of a priority. At the current rate of buildings, bike lanes,  we're never going to achieve a full network of all ages and abilities bike lanes. We need to start speeding it up and we need to stop accepting cars as the ultimate default all the time and rather allow everyone onto our streets equally. 30 seconds."}, {"start": 592.792, "end": 596.193, "speaker": "SPEAKER_21", "text": "Thank you.

I'm here on behalf of the NLG and the lawyers and legal workers throughout the state who make up our membership to express our outrage concerning the conduct of the Ann Arbor Police Department. Last Wednesday, July 12th, the volunteers of FedUp Ministries were, as they do each week, feeding our community from their free food truck at Liberty Plaza.  Officers from the AAPD used this occasion to arrest a citizen for a minor crime that was alleged to have occurred in another place and on another day. Their protestations to the contrary notwithstanding, this is not the first time the AAPD has carried out arrests at locations set up to serve the hungry and unhoused. We urge this council to take concrete steps to ensure that this is the last. No one should ever have to choose between food and their freedom.  Prosecuting petty theft cannot and must not be held as more important than the basic human right to sustenance. The good people at FedUp Ministries are an important part of the safety net that supports the most marginalized and underserved in our community. Using their work as bait for law enforcement undermines their ability to continue to serve our citizens and is frankly grotesque.  Where are our priorities? What do we value as a community? Are alleged violations of property rights truly more important than the human rights of our most valuable residents, our most vulnerable residents? It shows an utter lack of vision for this city to place law enforcement above all else. In what way was anyone truly protected or served by the Ann Arbor police last Wednesday? In what way did any of us benefit by making it more dangerous to feed or be fed in Ann Arbor?  Finally, let me point out that if we, society at large, citizens of Washtenaw County, or specifically this council, were meeting our obligations to all of our citizens, fed-up ministries would not need to be feeding our neighbors at Liberty Plaza each Wednesday. No one would be resorting to petty theft to survive. And the Ann Arbor police, regardless of their priorities, would have had no one to arrest last week. The police can do better.  This council can do better, both in supervising the police and in serving everyone in our community. And our community can do better. On behalf of the members of the National Lawyers Guild, Detroit and Michigan Chapter, we urge you to do so.

You are invited to keep the river healthy and beautiful. As people are getting outside in record numbers, the need to put leave-no-trace skills and ethics into action is more imperative than ever. I quote there from the permanent leave-no-trace plaque installed adjacent to the Argo Livery office.  Yesterday, the New York Times had an op-ed about the growing importance of  River recreation in our time of global warming, it focused on Munich's Isar River as green infrastructure, serving the needs and desires of thousands of urban residents. Ann Arbor's Huron River could have been included, a site of exponential growth of human activity, the centerpiece being the Cascades.  I love the cascades, the sound of falling water, the lovely walkway on the berm, the grasses on the banks. Sunday early, I watched expert kayakers practicing maneuvers. Recently, I encountered a young woman reading a book at the foot of the cascades amid dozens of tubers.  The city should be proud of the Cascades' amenity in 19- in 2012, converting a murky head race into an intended kayak and canoe playground as part of a costly project to save Argo Dam and Pond. I appreciate this. But the Cascades' plan failed in significant ways.  Three cascades that were planned became nine. Canoeing was considered hazardous, and canoers were redirected to an alternate portage. Not foreseen, tubing became number one. And ever-growing numbers were bringing their own inflatables, bypassing the livery office. So many people from a wide region seeking a blast at a very small site.  Overwhelming the Cascades neighborhood with traffic, parking issues, litter and drinking. Early on, neighbors began speaking up.  In 2012, police stepped up patrols to deal with the Cascades chaos. Parking restrictions were introduced, and council members seemed to be listening, even joining in with us to collect trash. Nevertheless, the issues of the Cascades traffic have grown year by year. I have two questions. Can the city bring a comprehensive approach to the protection of our neighborhood's security and well-being?  Would the city accept this chaos at other parks, facilities, golf courses, ice rinks, swimming pools, softball fields, special events venues?

The reason I wanted to come here tonight is to speak about the reparation initiative that the city council is getting ready to, I guess, initiate. I think that before you initiate a reparation committee, you should meet with some of the people that used to live here, that has been moved out of this community. You should listen to some of the pain and anger that they have regarding how they've been gentrified out of the community.  There are people that are born here that cannot afford to live here. You know, those are the kinds of things that I think when you're looking at reparation, you should include that in the conversation, because that's one of the reasons why we need that. For example, you know, we look at City Hall and the employment ratio here.  There's very few black employees here. If you go out on these construction sites, you don't see any black men. The kind of job that we used to do, the hard stuff, you don't see that anymore because they're good paying jobs. So people that really could benefit from that are not being able to benefit. So I think those are the kinds of things that you should look at when you talk about establishing a recreation task force. Because those are the kinds of things that you need to take into consideration. Because just to create an initiative, just  initiative is not something that is valuable. I would also like to speak to the issue. I think I read in the paper about a month, a month and a half ago, where there was a presentation made by the city administrator to build housing, I guess, attached to the city hall. And I think the statement was that there would be no low-income housing, affordable housing.  And I find that to be contradictory to what the city is about. The city should be looking at taking care of those, especially if we're going to be using city property to build housing. People that can't afford housing otherwise should be given an opportunity to live in the structure. After all, this is the people's house. We pay their taxes. We support this. So I think that to say that these units, whenever they are bound to come about,  would not be open to people with low income. I don't think that's morally right. And I would like to congratulate Sister Cynthia Harrison for being a part of this initiative. I knew her mother, I knew her father, I knew her family, and they would be proud of you for taking the initiative that you're taking.

I'm glad that CA9 has been pulled from the agenda for further consideration. I'll keep my comments brief and maybe back in August once I see what the next iteration will look like.  As a part of Council of 2018 through 2022, I co-sponsored the millage for affordable housing. I also co-sponsored the resolutions to transfer the city-owned property to the Housing Commission for a nominal fee of, I think, $1 to build affordable housing. As we all know, this site has a long history of affordable housing. Affordable housing was there before  Things were torn down and left vacant So it was alarming for me to see that council had thought of essentially reneging on prior commitments While on council I was reminded that promises made our promises kept There was the 40 40 20 resolution which I tried unsuccessfully to overturn I  yet it was vetoed and promises were made and promises were kept. When the millage was passed, we all knew it was not enough money. We were gonna need hundreds of millions of dollars to address affordable housing, not just 120 or 150 million. It was just one tool at our disposal, a big tool to transfer city-owned property to the Housing Commission to build affordable housing.  In 2017 and 2018, we heard the value of leveraging dollars so that we can use housing tax credits to leverage 5 million for it to become 50 million. I am just here today urging this council to reconsider this thought, which I believe is a financial shell game. It is to free up $5 million from the general fund  to then spend on other initiatives and projects. Many of you campaigned, most of you, if not all, some were uncontested. But when you're out there, you hear from folks, affordable housing is the number one issue. And since COVID, it's even become more acute of an issue.  I urge this council to honor past resolutions and transfer this property for next to nothing to the Housing Commission. Do not go ahead with taking $5 million from the Ann Arbor Housing Commission.

At the last city council meeting, we heard from council member Chris Watson about how he is rightfully afraid of the police. He is rightfully afraid of the police. So you might guess that Watson would identify with Palestinians who are rightfully afraid of being kidnapped and killed by the Israeli military, not just pulled over.  But no, unless Watson is the one, and he cannot even make eye contact. There we go, eye contact. But no, unless Watson is the one getting pulled over and killed himself, he simply doesn't care who Israel kills with his money. Doesn't care at all, far as I can tell. Correct me if I'm wrong.  Israel was almost founded in Uganda in 1905, except the white settlers stopped the whole plan. So instead of massacring Africans, Israel went over and established itself in Palestine to massacre Palestinians. It could have been Africans.  Israel tried to give nuclear weapons, the atomic bomb, to apartheid South Africa to kill black people, Chris. To kill black people, Chris. But Councilmember Watson is too busy to care. Too busy crying like a baby over the sufferings of the European Holocaust, which ended in 1945. What a pitiful sissy. What a pitiful sissy.  He knows what white supremacist state violence is. He knows, but don't ask him for a Palestinian human rights resolution, or he's liable, oh, there goes Iyer, running away from the room. We're gonna talk about you in a minute. Don't ask him for a Palestinian human rights resolution, or else he'll get down on his knees and cry over the tragedy of white Europeans.  Over white Europeans. But white Europeans are not afraid of the police today. They don't need your tears, Chris. Palestinians need you. Do you think it's right, Chris, for Palestinians to pay for the Holocaust? Palestinians? Who gave you that sick idea?  Pitiful as Councilmember Watson is, Jen Eyre sitting there is worse. Eyre took campaign money from old friends of the Israel Defense Forces, and you know the IDF is just like the Ku Klux Klan, except you're paying them $3.8 billion every year.  And look, Ayer is now sinking the whole reparations boat for black people, trying to pit black and native people against each other and put them at each other's throats for reparations money.

All right. Hello, Ann Arbor. I'm here to go over what has happened in the past couple of weeks. The last city council meeting, we, the people, managed to put the issue of reparations to black America on the table. These people here and their buddies before them, no one ever did that.  The people of this town put the issue of reparations on the agenda, on the discussion table a couple of weeks ago. And there is an article in the Ann Arbor News. You can go look it up and you can see how all these people are bellyaching about, oh, yeah, how they really want to do it. If they wanted to do it, they would have done it.  Like Blaine said, in the 1800s, black people were asking for reparations. They were saying, give us a mule and 40 acres and we would sustain ourselves. Did they give it to them? No. These people have no intentions of giving anything to blacks or red people or native people or anything, as much as they say they might, and they don't say it much, but anyway, they have no intention. We have to kick their ass into actually doing it.  So I want to ask everyone in Ann Arbor to come here, speak for reparations, and let's push and force these people to do it.  Again, as Blaine said, and as you can see from everyone who speaks here, the population in this town is not happy with the record that this bunch has. This bunch gets pushed into their places by the donations they accept from the ultra wealthy in this town. They take over the seats and they vote all of them.  with Mr. Mayor here, who is the man for, you know, deciding what goes and what doesn't go. So we want a representative city government. This is not representing the people. As you can see, after 20 years of just talking about  affordable housing. We do not have affordable housing, but we have a whole lot of luxury housing that nobody can afford, $800,000 minimum level of houses you can buy in Ann Arbor. That is a shame. That tells you clearly that this city council does not care about  Regular people, it cares about the rich. This city council doesn't care about blacks, but we have to force them to care. If they did care, do you think the university would be accepting 4% black enrollment? No, they would have been bringing it up to 10%, which is what they promised 50 years ago.  Any of these guys ever pushed the university to do it? No, they haven't. Look at the Ann Arbor now. Lefebvre said it. Many, many communities of black have been pushed out of this town because of these guys. So do not be fooled by them when they tell you, yeah, we will have committees, we will talk about reparations. No, they will not.  They will make sure that it gets grind down to the floor.

I would like to thank council members for not only just pulling this from the consent agenda, but pulling it from the agenda in its entirety. I'd ask that you focus on meeting the expectations of the people. We did pass an affordable housing millage.  And we do have certain expectations, and one of those was the development of affordable housing on that site, at the old Y lot. It was identified that that's just an ideal location for affordable housing, right downtown, right next to the Blake Transit Center. And if you recall, there was talk about not even putting any affordable housing units there, and just having a payment loop for non-affordable housing development. That gladly, fortunately, went by the wayside,  And we had an approval for a building that would have a minimum number of affordable housing units. I forget the exact number, but a couple of towers and one would be all affordable housing. But we also approved the possibility of that building going up as high as 275 feet. It should be about 50% more than people's expectations going into that. So again, as we review this whole project and where the money's going, where it's coming from,  Please think about what the people's expectations were when we passed an affordable housing billage and when we supported development or analysis of the city-owned sites for affordable housing. One of those sites was also 415 West Washington. That one's a bit of a shell game. What's going on there is a, I've spoken about it before, but we're gonna, the way it's designed right now, we're gonna have zero dollars for affordable housing on that site. And it's a bit of a bait and twitch over there.  Nice luxury units, but no affordable housing money whatsoever. I would like to thank certain private developers who are doing the right thing in terms of providing affordable housing, providing sustainable building techniques. I want to call out the developer of the PUD at North Maple. I think it's a shining example. They've been lauding it since they first came to the pre-PUD meeting, to the planning commission, of somebody who studied what the city wants  study what the people of the city want, and deliver it on affordable housing and sustainability from the outset, not being dragged tooth and nail, not having to negotiate. They led the right type of development. And I want to ask us, what kind of message do we send when we applaud a developer like that? But then what's on the agenda tonight later on? We'll talk about the details later.  We're the exact opposite. Avoidance of $9 million of affordable housing, a stubbornness to do anything whatsoever of any meaning for sustainable building."}, {"start": 1907.759, "end": 1910.322, "speaker": "SPEAKER_14", "text": "Time."}, {"start": 1910.322, "end": 1912.104, "speaker": "SPEAKER_18", "text": "What message do we want to send?"}, {"start": 1912.104, "end": 1917.25, "speaker": "SPEAKER_21", "text": "Thank you.

This was prior to my election and serving on council. The state awarded smart zone funding  to the smart zone entities across the state that we, our local development finance authority, benefited from with the intention of awarding $400,000 in grants for purposes to promote our entrepreneurial-driven and high-tech economy here locally.  Due to COVID, that money was not awarded for various reasons. And instead of, it was a use it or lose it situation where we would, if not spent according to the grant agreement, would have to return that money to the state. So versus returning that money to the state where it would not directly benefit our local economy, the LADFA board did decide to allocate this funding to Spark, who is our SmartZone partner.  And that extra $400,000, this increase in their budget, will go towards two initiatives specifically designed to meet the city's broader goals. And so the two initiatives that SPARK is looking to implement with that funding is a DEI initiative, which would  work to support and directly encourage entrepreneurial growth within BIPOC and minority communities. And the second half of that $400,000 increase would go to support innovation and entrepreneurship  around circular economy initiatives. And so directly in support of two really important things that we've heard the community wants. So this is in addition to SPARC's regular contract, the LDFA contract that we have with that organization and is a one-time funding. So I wanted to make sure that that was clear that this funding is for a very specific purpose and is a one-time increase in the contract."}, {"start": 2756.858, "end": 2833.003, "speaker": "SPEAKER_21", "text": "Further discussion?

I look at the multi-use aspects. Go back and look at the old Lower Town  commission plan of 2009 with what they thought was a desirable way to use what had been a great Kroger lot, drugstore, so on.

My name is Laura Stroh, 1327 Broadway. I hope you all had time to read my letter. Yes? Good, because I don't want to repeat the letter. And I'm sorry I sent it to you twice that the first letter said January 17th. I don't know what I was doing about that. But we need retail in the neighborhood. I'll be careful to avoid now the catchwords you seem to dislike. Preserve, protect, integrity of the neighborhood, maintain character.  Is it wrong for us to want to maintain and protect the character of our wonderful neighborhood? Well, whatever. Instead, I want to ask you to think about the words that you should like, sustainability, walkability, access. Every developer in this area of Lower Town, and there aren't a lot of chances left, will beg off retail because it is notoriously hard to pull off retail anywhere in the city, as many of you know.  Apartments, even expensive apartments like Beekman, are apparently gold mines. The university provides developers with a hard-to-resist market of either rich students or those willing to go into debt by constantly increasing its enrollment. It is irresistible all over town to service this market and ignore our real needs for affordable housing,  And we all know that the paltry requirements the developers are often forced to make by having a small percentage of lower rent units is just that, paltry. The developer of Beekman will tell you that this third building is neither the best spot for retail nor is it the right time. I've already debunked both of those arguments in my letter to you. Mr. Mucher argues that this area historically can't support retail.  But Kroger's was one of the most popular and successful stores in the city, and it failed, as I pointed out to you. It didn't fail, but it was judged by the corporate people that there should be bigger Kroger's, and so they were moved.  It wasn't true back when Kroger's was there that retail couldn't be supported by the neighborhood, and it surely isn't with at least 800 new apartments in the area, along with new hospital facilities and two U of M parking structures right across the street.  He will point to the north side grill block as a better place for retail, but the old party store that's there just sold for a whopping amount, I forget, something millions, and whoever bought it will no doubt give you the same argument, that retail is too unreliable for investment. A bit of retail in this final morningside building, and I'm only asking you for a bit,  Instead of a few apartments on the ground floor would be good for everyone It will make Morningside's apartments more attractive and serve the neighborhood is serve a bad word.

I live on Division Street just over the bridge from this development. And I've been here before. And I'm here again to continue my support for this project and to sort of provide maybe a different angle. There have been discussions so far on sustainability and green initiatives and with fires in Canada and a number of other things and heat waves. It's never been clearer that we have to be concerned about these things.  What I'd like to sort of bring back up is 20 years ago, we were thinking about this. There was a Green Belt Initiative that we passed in 2003, and the idea that was part and parcel of that was to close off sprawl and development going outward away from the center, which would necessitate more driving and more commuting and more greenhouse gases.  but which would necessarily require denser development in core areas that are closer to major attractions in our city, the hospital being an obvious one. This building does just that. And in the time since the Greenbelt Initiative, the last 20 years, and my numbers are vague because I don't know exact numbers and I apologize, but universities enrollment was somewhere in the mid-30s, 30,000, 34,000.  And now we're coming up on 54. So we've gone up by about 20,000 enrolled students in the last 20 years. It took about five years after the Green Belt Initiative for the momentum of development in town to start responding to that initiative. And by about, I think, 2008, we were seeing the first buildings, 411 Lofts on the corner of Division, Washington, Zaragon on the corner of South U and East U, where I think some of the early  early buildings of this type and in the 15-year sense all of them added together if you count the bedrooms is 11,000 bedrooms. So we've created housing for 11,000 more students where the demand has gone almost two to one up because of enrollment. The 800 pound gorilla in this room is the university. It's why most of us live here. It's why this city exists.  And that fact necessitates everything else. We can argue that there's greed or developers do it because they like it or it's irresistible.  Before you get to that point, it's necessary. Everything we worry about in terms of affordability and price points of housing is being driven by that fact first and foremost. And how we respond to it and how aggressively we respond to it in this area and in other areas will determine how much leeway we have to really address the problems of pricing after that. But first, we have to stop falling behind. We're two to one behind. We have to fix that problem first and then  get to things like how we find places to build subsidized housing so that we can get multiple price points. Is that it? That's it.

The city council should vote no on the rezoning, both because the developer is offering so little mixed use that the site will scarcely resemble the mixed use urban village that has long been recommended by the comprehensive plan.  and because this development will not move us toward one of our current planning initiatives, the 15-minute walkable neighborhood. Neither can it boast bringing us closer to our sustainability goals by significant electrification, as was suggested to the developer by the City Planning Commission. Ann Arbor residents are paying a millage for both climate action  and affordable housing. In my view, developers should be part of the equation too. The Ann Arbor public should not be fooled. The current conditional zoning absolutely gives city council the option to ask for more from this development. In other words, city council has a choice. You can vote yes on the rezoning and likely add to Morningside's profits  or you can vote no on the rezoning, thereby giving the developer the opportunity to propose something better, something that is more in line with Ann Arbor's clearly stated goals of making our city more sustainable, more affordable, and more walkable.

I've written to you talking at length about the discretion that City Council has in this vote. And about what some of that means, in terms of being able to achieve sustainability. I am in favor of  a dense resident, primarily residential building at this location. For those who've been around long enough, you recall that the neighborhood back 2016, 2017 was in favor of a primarily residential, very dense development at this location, and we were hopeful that it would include a mixed-use urban village and some affordable housing. We all supported that, and I do continue to support  additional density, residential density on this third base. Got no problem with that. So I want to ask you if you all understand what this means. If you get rid of the conditions on zoning, you get rid of the discretion you have to ask this developer to build more sustainably, to include more affordable housing, to include more retail instead of a pool, for example. It then becomes more of a buy right as a condition on the height limit.  and the developer can build whatever he wants to go. You can approve the site plan that he's got in front of you right now, but then once you walk away with a yes vote on both of these, tomorrow the developer probably isn't going to, but could, go belly up and sell the property and somebody could build something else that meets C1AR and have that height restriction, but maybe they build all office, no residential whatsoever.  Maybe you want to ask staff if that's a possibility. That's up to you if you want to ask. But I want you to understand, when you take away the conditional zoning, you're not locking in the site plan that you approve afterwards. You're giving an approval to it. But the developer can build anything that meets the CUNAR with the remaining conditions. I don't think you are ready for this. At a minimum, postponement is in order to understand full complexity of what this means.  I prefer an outright rejection because of the arrogance of this developer and not meeting our sustainability requirements that other developers are willing to make. 721 South Forest wants to build all electric except for gas-fired backup generators. I believe Valhalla is offering something similar like that. Other developers are doing even better in terms of full electrification. This developer didn't want to put in electric stoves. I think you need to send a message  to your citizens and to other developers. No, you gotta do better with sustainability. Everybody else is trying. You gotta ask this guy to try.

So, if I had one complaint about this tonight, it's that it's before city council at all.  You know, vehemently disagree with one of the previous commenters that because I think this project should never have had the site plan attached to the zoning as a condition. Now, to be fair, the developer requested that because that is the only way that you can do a conditional zoning, but the developer did this only because of what they perceived the political reality to be.  One of the previous commenters also already brought up the stark numbers of just what university enrollment growth is doing to us in our housing market. And that's not the only thing. I've had similar numbers of staff growth, and there's other drivers of increased demand for housing in Ann Arbor, even besides the university. So fighting over every single site like this will never get us to where we need to be.  to resolve this housing crisis. We need to allow a lot more development by right.

Unfortunately, historical development practices, including the infrastructure we've built that encourages more driving, works against that. The city simply doesn't have the power to magic up more demand for retail in the space. But you know what the city does have the power to do? Approve more density so more people can live in walking distance, and we can create the conditions  that will allow a 15-minute urban village to thrive in lower town.

Awesome, thank you. Hi, so I'm new to these meetings, never been to one before, but been born and raised in this town, 25, and went to University of Michigan as well. And I guess I'm not really familiar with the zoning principles. I'll come to the next meeting more prepared. This is a little bit more impersonal, I'll come in person. But I guess,  The main thing with these zoning concepts that I think I'm a little bit concerned about is just as perceived person who's been in this town for a long time, it seems like everything seems to be going in a very specific direction. And if these zoning principles or whatever, I don't really, frankly, care about developer rights. That's not an important part of this dynamic. I'm seeing dozens of more homeless people on the street every day, and they come up to me regularly asking me for money and having conversations with me.  And it's becoming more and more concerning to me to think about these developments happening when I just don't really understand why. Like I see luxury housing coming up across from my neighborhood, more values of house that are 800,000 to 1.2 million, whereas the housing that's under $1,000 a month. I'm just, I understand there's a lot of folks coming from the East Coast, West Coast who go to school here. I went to school with many of them, but I don't think that that should be where we put the value.  if I'm what I'm hearing is 100 150 units of housing that doesn't sound like quite a lot. I might just be negligent on what the actual zoning policy is here. But it seems like you need to be creating a lot more housing for a specific population and be more creative about how you can get the money for low income housing. I don't know how that works exactly. But my appeal to you all in the city council meeting is if you are to choose to make such an approval or decline  really think about whether this is actually impacting the people actually need it most. I don't, I don't have the answer because I have not even read the policy yet. But that seems integral to this more than is about development. We have enough development here. It's a lovely city, lived here all my whole life. I've been very privileged here my whole life. And I'm concerned about the fact that it's not an actually diversity and that incorporates class.

That if you bought a package of frozen vegetables, and it said mixed vegetables, and you got all carrots and one pea, you wouldn't call it mixed use or mixed vegetables.

We know that single family houses are less efficient than apartment buildings. We know that making people drive in rather than being right here in the middle of the city is more energy intensive.

I sympathize with very much that I have heard. So we are asked to amend the conditions of a C1AR zoning district in order to create more than twice the housing units where a less dense project had originally been envisioned.  When you hear amending or lifting the condition, it might sound like we're freeing the developer to do more of what they want. In this case, we're freeing the developer to do more of what we want. Instead of an 80 condo project for sale, we will get 196 units of rental housing.  at a site that is ideally situated to promote walking and biking. It sits less than a 10 minutes walk from a major employer, the hospital, 15 to 20 minutes from Carytown, from Main Street, and from Central Campus. Now, as one of the callers mentioned, a change like this would normally require no more than a new site plan, which would normally not involve a zoning decision.  It would in fact not even come to Council at all, but would have received final approval at Planning Commission. Council is seeing this only because a condition of the original zoning specified that this project must execute the 1140 Broadway condo project site plan. Because the two are linked, we have to amend the zoning in order for the site plan to change.  Now, I really sympathize with desire for mixed use or more peas with our carrots, as it was so delightfully put. We can affirm it. We can have plans that state a desire for mixed use. And we can zone for it. That's how you translate plans into action. And we've done all of that.  But for mixed use to materialize, financiers, being the people who funded developers, not the developers themselves, have to be willing to invest in it. And many other cities give them the opportunity to make a better return on their dollar than Ann Arbor does. So we have no way of requiring mixed use. We can welcome it, and we can make it possible. But we can't require it.  Folks have mentioned electrification. I wish every project that came before the city were fully electric, but as a city, we have no way of requiring that. And even if we did, in this instance, fossil gas heating infrastructure is already in the ground. It was installed when the first phase of this project was constructed.  But that does not mean that this project is not sustainable. Considerable contaminated groundwater was remediated when this got going. The developer installed EV chargers in the parking deck before the city was requiring them and will install additional ones now. This phase of the project will have electric dryers, and the developer has said he is investigating electric stoves.  And really a great benefit of this project is that it provides one protected bike space per unit Which is well beyond what our code requires and these will be located at the ground level with easy egress to the street councilmember Okay, when we come back for the site plan, I'll tell you more councilmember song"}, {"start": 5362.828, "end": 5551.74, "speaker": "SPEAKER_28", "text": "I was really moved when I heard from folks who remembered the retail that was there at the site before. I mean, I share this memories of Manna, the Korean grocery store there. I celebrated my children's 100-day birthday, first year birthday with mandu, bulgogi. They had fresh tteok, which is rice cakes.  It was very difficult 50 to 20 years ago to find that kind of grocery. Now we have several more Korean grocery stores in town. And it really relied on small family businesses to support this. So in my enthusiasm in responding to some folks who had emailed and I called,  Our commenter tonight I also talked about how we had approved liquor license not too far from this site to just last year and My eagerness in seeing the DTE site being developed but in in talking a little bit more with council members I think another question came up which is financing and  So, who actually pays for these retail spaces and how do we actually occupy these retail spaces? There are reasons why we see new businesses coming in like Taco Bell, Dunkin Donuts, Chick-fil-A coming in. It's because they're financed to come in and they have the funds to do this. To talk about retail in new developments and engage with developers on this end and asking for  the Retail spaces. There's no guarantee that they'll be occupied And the the financial burden is on the developer themselves. So where do And as well as renters, so how do we support? You know Will this be an increase in rent? I mean, it's hard to it's difficult to see it's like a chicken before the egg But I think it's really like the banks  What are the banks willing to finance when it comes to our wishes and dreams and what we see in our community? And it's also a struggle that we see with our own public parcels. As you remember, Jennifer Hall, just a couple meetings ago, said that we're at a point where each unit is at $400,000 in costs, and that's with 11 streams of financing, right? We don't exist out of market conditions.  I'm sorry that we can't somehow capture the good memories and experiences of Ann Arbor from 15 20 years ago where we had small businesses that could thrive and Perhaps this is a question where we can talk about more about small business support and economic development. I'm really happy to hear Councilmember canal speak to this earlier and how we're trying to do that work as well as councilmember Ayers on that particular Commission and  But when it comes to development and planning, it's a different beast And I do hope with the developer here You can understand that sentimental reasons why people would like to welcome mixed use in retail Because it's not just supporting walkable a walkable community But a diverse community with diverse needs and that would rather not see large box retail in our in our downtown corridor  We have a lot of donut shops actually in our city supported by former refugees.

I think councilmember dish spoke to why? That's it's not appropriate for us to be Requiring that in this development at this point and  But I do think that we have opportunities. Council Member Song spoke to the fact that we need to be thinking about small business development, and we obviously are to some degree, but there is work for us to be doing on that. I brought that up during the TC1 discussions as well.  It's something that we actively need to be thinking about as we move forward. But we're also embarking on the update to our comprehensive plan. And it's important to remember that 70% of the land in Ann Arbor resident land is zoned single family only.  And so right now, in our neighborhoods, we don't permit the neighborhood grocery store that used to exist in places like the Old West Side. We've had places like the Knights Market and Jefferson Market, and those are historically areas where we didn't have, it's not a large Kroger, but it's that small little market that existed within neighborhoods that neighbors were able to turn to. We've made that illegal. We have the opportunity to change that in the future, and I hope that folks, when they engage  Planning process will be asking for mixed use in their neighborhoods because I think that is the opportunity for us to bring back affordable retail in To our neighborhoods and across our city. So in terms of this particular project I'm supportive of the zoning changes. I will say for the  Residents that move into this location They are in a 15-minute neighborhood. They are as councilmember dish spoke to a 15-minute walk from Kerrytown You know, they there are Amenities nearby do we want more?

We're not being asked to change the mix of affordable units. We're not being asked to forego sustainability items that they previously committed to and are asking not to now. We're being asked to change from 86 condos to 196 apartments and less parking.

The bottom line is that we have a housing crisis in the city of Ann Arbor and that housing prices are too high. They're too high because of  simply put, supply and demand. We are not in the position to depress demand, and so if the housing crisis, if the affordability crisis is unacceptable to us, we have a number of alternatives. We can build housing. We're in the process of doing that with great rigor. We can  permit housing, which we're doing through rezonings, and when we are offered the opportunity for a requested rezoning that meets our goals, that does expand housing in a way, in a place where it is beneficial, we can approve it. That, I think, is the circumstance we have before us, and I'm glad that it will be moving forward. Further discussion?  All in favour? Opposed? It is approved.

And in doing so, have we just passed up an opportunity to negotiate with the developer? You heard that a lot in the comments. And the answer to that question is no. By law, in a conditional zoning, conditions are offered by the developer.  And the developer looks for things that they think align with city priorities. Conditional zoning is not an opportunity to impose conditions and exact concessions from a developer. And even if we were inclined to do that, doing it at the council table would be unseemly.  if not worse. So I want to, since we are now talking, I know it feels like we're having the same discussion again, but I want to talk about a couple of features of the side plan that we didn't get a chance to mention earlier. The developer for this project originally agreed to set aside a percentage of units for affordable housing.  That agreement resulted in 15 units that are being rented out at max 60% AMI across the first two buildings of the project. The developer has voluntarily committed to extending those same terms, did not have to do this at all, to 999 Maiden Lane. This will increase the count of affordable housing units by approximately six units at max 60% AMI.  And at the pace that we're moving, constructing affordable housing on our city-owned sites, and we are moving, it's just that this pace is slow. 18 units is not a bad deal. The project, in terms of parking, also satisfies the city's current preference to devote more space to housing people than to storing cars.  The developer proposes to add just 15 additional surface parking spaces, which raises the total of spaces at this project overall to 579 spaces, 30 outside surface, 549 in the parking structure.  What is really cool about this project is it was a social science experiment for our lifting mandatory parking minimums. The project was approved under our old rules, which required minimums. The developer would have been required to provide one parking space per dwelling unit. The project received a variance in 2017 to provide 0.9 spaces per dwelling unit.  The rental housing at 1200 Broadway has been in operation for two years and demand for parking has been 0.6 spaces per dwelling unit. Now, I am not saying that that is the magic number for everywhere, but I'm saying that in a site that is located where this one is, close to the hospital, close to Carytown, close to Main Street, close to Central Campus, 0.6 looks really good and there is no evidence of spillover into the surrounding neighborhood."}, {"start": 6052.55, "end": 6176.567, "speaker": "SPEAKER_24", "text": "So councilmember yay for that Councilman Breyer Thank you, I I just want to I thought it was interesting that the word humanitarian was used earlier and That's not one that we often hear here in in chambers and I appreciate the the  the focus on humanitarianism, which of course is the promotion of human welfare. I think there are a number of ways to look at this, and I certainly don't discount the way that the resident was using it. I think another way, and certainly one way that I look at  The promotion of human welfare in our city when it comes to density is Allowing more people to live in our community people who are going to school here people who are working here Giving them a place to live when I see buildings  Do I sometimes lament the architecture? Yeah. But I see them in terms of the people that they house much more so than I see the structure itself. And I think it further helps our current residents when we allow increased density because we  folks are going to end up somewhere. And if they don't end up in new housing, particularly people who are going to the university or who are working at the hospital, that's more existing residential housing units that will be converted into rentals.

A2 STEAM is pretty close by. Ann Arbor Public Schools did a major investment in updating that to a K-8 school, expanding it from a K-6 school. And that is a school that has attracted, has really re-enlivened the neighborhood, brought investment, brought back families who had left the Ann Arbor Public Schools for private and charter schools.  My son finished middle school there, and I feel maybe what we can think about this development is maybe perhaps it's closer to what we see at Valhalla which is across from Pioneer High School at 454 units so this is a fraction of what we see across town, close to public schools, close to employer.  So I think there's a lot of potential to come. Talking about retail is just one part of what we expect in our communities to see in our communities. And perhaps retail will come later on. I feel bad about mentioning donuts. Perhaps that was unseemly. Refugee donuts are actually very delicious. So sorry about that.  I'm not on planning. I am clearly not on planning commission. But I do feel some sort of a level of excitement to think that we'll be addressing the housing crisis. And then Council Member Dish is telling me we'll have 700 units across all three buildings.

We were actually unanimous in this recommendation of rezoning these 11 parcels to R1D. So these parcels come to us through the long path that has been annexation.  And the original recommendation for the parcels was R1A, which is what the context is.  And, I should say and, Planning Commission had an extensive discussion of why should we zone more things R1A when we want, as I just said and we just talked about, greater density. And so we considered whether to align the rezoning of these 11 annexed parcels more closely to A20 goals by assigning a multifamily zoning designation. And we came to the conclusion that  You don't want to fight a four-alarm fire with a garden hose, and so rezoning 11 parcels isn't really a good strategy. And we are about to have a comp plan, and we can talk systematically about what we want to do with single-family zoning. But there was something that we could do.  And that was changed from R1A, which has a minimum lot size of 20,000 square feet, to R1D.  The minimum lot size is 5,000 square feet, and its front and rear setbacks are roughly half, its minimum front and rear setbacks are roughly half that of R1A. So R1D, the front setback is 25 square feet, and the rear is, or rather 25 feet, and the rear is 20 feet.  So that's why it comes to you as R1D and not bigger. In addition, going to R4C, for example, would require different utility specifications, fire hydrant requirements, and other things. So the infrastructure in that area is not in place for that. This is something that we need to think systematically and holistically about as we think through the details of the comp plan of how we achieve densification.  given that it's going to, in places, clash with what we have for utility.

We need more housing. 196 units is not enough. Seven floors is not enough. This project should be exceeding Tower Plaza in  The fact that our tallest building has been tower plaza since 1969 says to me that Ann Arbor is still spending too much time thinking two dimensionally. But quite frankly, we only have so much horizontal space in the city. On climate, I'd love to see this be all electric. I'd love it to be more climate friendly than it is.  But what I don't want to do is make the perfect the enemy of the good. Let's assume that one person lives in each of these 196 units. What's the alternative if it doesn't get built? 196 houses in Whitmore Lake. 196 houses down in the southern part of Pittsfield Township. That seems a whole lot worse to me.  We know that single family houses are less efficient than apartment buildings. We know that making people drive in rather than being right here in the middle of the city is more energy intensive. So the fact that this isn't perfect is disappointing.  But it's better than the alternative. We've got to remember that.

The bottom line is that we have a housing crisis in the city of Ann Arbor and that housing prices are too high. They're too high because of  simply put, supply and demand. We are not in the position to depress demand, and so if the housing crisis, if the affordability crisis is unacceptable to us, we have a number of alternatives. We can build housing. We're in the process of doing that with great rigor. We can  permit housing, which we're doing through rezonings, and when we are offered the opportunity for a requested rezoning that meets our goals, that does expand housing in a way, in a place where it is beneficial, we can approve it. That, I think, is the circumstance we have before us, and I'm glad that it will be moving forward. Further discussion?  All in favour? Opposed?
