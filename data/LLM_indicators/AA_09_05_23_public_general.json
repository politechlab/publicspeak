I am a limited license social worker who graduated with my MSW from University of Michigan 2020. I work for disability network Washington member Livingston and I and my organization  Support the passing of Resolution 23-14-69, directing the city administrators to advocate for the Michigan legislature to end the use of 14C certificates in the state of Michigan. Disability Network originally formed as the Ann Arbor Center for Independent Living almost 50 years ago, making us the fourth oldest center for independent living in the country. So much has changed for people with disabilities since 1976.  For starters, lifelong institutionalization is no longer the ever-present threat to people with disabilities that it was, and Americans are much more accustomed to the idea of people with disabilities living full, independent, fulfilling lives, including working the same jobs that non-disabled folks do. Employment opportunities for people with disabilities have increased exponentially with the help of technology and state, federal, and workplace policies.  but an 85-year-old policy is still holding people with disabilities back from full inclusion in the workplace. And this is Section 14C of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. I'm sure it's becoming increasingly clear to the honorable members of this council that the state minimum wage of $10.10 an hour is not enough to get by in the city of Ann Arbor anymore, but it is still legal for some people to be paid less than $1 an hour in Michigan thanks to this policy.  A business, community vocational organization, or educational institution can apply for a federal waiver which allows them to use a convoluted formula with virtually no oversight to pay people with disabilities based on their observed productivity on the job. People without disabilities do not need to have their productivity measured to determine their wages, so why is this still the case for people with disabilities?  The arguments for keeping sub-minimum wage are often effervescent of the shortcomings of other government policies designed to keep people with disabilities out of poverty. And it is true that these policies often require people with disabilities to monitor and report their earnings and assets in order to keep receiving assistance. But organizations like ours, Disability Network, that provide benefits  such as services, such as benefits counseling, excuse me, which allows a person with a disability to see how much they can work at a competitively compensated job. 30 seconds. All right. Several advocates with intellectual and developmental disabilities in Michigan are currently pushing for a state law that includes a phase-out plan that involves connecting from a minimum wage earners to local resources that already exist.  I hope that Michigan joins the 13 states that have currently banned the use of 14 CWOA certificates and support the passing of this resolution.

I was dreading coming out today. I just returned from 10 days in Incline Village, Nevada, but  I found the speakers both entertaining, informative, and I agreed with most of what they said. So this is great. It seems like young people are starting to agree with me or I'm starting to agree with them. Anyway, the theme of my talk tonight is unintended consequences. Sometimes unintended consequences are just inconvenient. But as a prior speaker mentioned, sometimes they result in death in a roadway.  Regarding traffic calming, I think it's absolutely critical that we look at the unintended consequences. If we are putting traffic calming on one street, we need to look at the parallel streets. And that is something that Sam Schwartz recommends, Sam Schwartz, a consultant who did Vision Zero,  There's an excellent example of what they did with the busway on 14th Street in New York City. So we need to be more methodical in our implementation and consider those unintended consequences. Next, we need to look at school crosswalks. I brought this forward at the last meeting, and I was really concerned about overgrown vegetation, because that's one of my pet peeves. But the first three people I showed it to said  Why isn't the crosswalk marked? It's like, I don't know. And then I checked and the crosswalk design guidelines, which we spent considerable time on, definitely specifies that it should be marked. And so, again,  and unintended consequences, we overlook this. And when I went down there today, I counted over 50 cars that were parked along this area, including right through the crosswalks, because I don't think parents even knew it was a crosswalk because it wasn't marked. My last area is that we are wrongly charging people and endangering pedestrians. And one example is the corner of Beaks  Kingsley and Main Street. There was a greyhound bus driver who hit a pedestrian. I've gone down there, I've looked at it, other engineers have looked at it also. It is humanly impossible to see a pedestrian in that crosswalk because there is inadequate lighting at the crosswalk and there are bright globes that the DDA put in just beyond that. So you're looking at a glare  and you can't even see a pedestrian there. So I hope that you will implement safer crosswalks. Thank you."}], "public_hearings_1": [], "public_hearings_2": [{"start": 3577.933, "speaker": "SPEAKER_10", "text": "Thank you, Mayor and Council. My name is Tom Renker, and I'm representing the Ann Arbor Area Board of Realtors. And I'd like to just kind of start out and thank you for letting me speak and kind of voice our concerns. We talked a couple of weeks ago, we talked a lot about the time that's been spent on this, that the Energy Commission has spent many years working on this. We shouldn't be doing this for the Energy Commission. We should be doing this because it's the right thing to do. Realtors have been working on this for a long time.  Our first meeting with the Energy Commission was in June 2018, more than five years ago. And out of that, two members, two realtors became members of the subcommittee of the Energy Commission, Jack Brown of Howard Hanna and Chrissy George of Trillium Real Estate.  They worked with the subcommittee many times. They did research work. They contacted other municipalities. They contacted other association of realtors. And the findings of that subcommittee were that, yes, great things come out of this. There's some wonderful statistics and data that comes out of these reports that are very valuable to the city itself. But in the end, there was truly no measurable results.  that the buyers, after they received these reports, did nothing with them simply because they couldn't afford it. Like here in Ann Arbor, we talked about this last time, average sales price year-to-date, $630,000. Buyers are tapped out. They've spent it. And true, there are incentives available. They can get $1,000, $2,000, $3,000, $4,000, but to get those incentives, what do they have to spend? Buyers are not going to go further into debt to actually make this happen.  So we're sitting here today saying that we're going to force sellers to do something they don't need and will never use by doing the audit. And we're going to have the sellers give it to the buyer. And true, the buyer will have some use for it up front. They'll see another estimate of what it might cost. They may be able to use that number to say, you know, is this good or bad? If I'm looking at a house that's a one and one that's a five, it gives me some negotiation power. Maybe I choose the five. Who knows where that five's going to be.  But the point is, is that we're forcing someone to do something that they don't really need to do, giving it to someone that won't use it. It just seems like a real waste of some considerable funds that we're going to spend $200,000 to $300,000 a year with the way that this is currently structured. We look at staffing, all in expenses. This is a big expense.  Let's find someone that will actually use these reports. You have thousands of people every year that are putting together building permits, they're hiring contractors, they're a perfect source for an audience for whether it be a forced or whether it be an offering to actually use this type of an ordinance or use this type of report for some real value.  So I would ask you to really think about this, that, you know, what we're planning to do is not going to help us reach our 820 goals. I mean, Jack and Chrissy, ultimately, they were never asked to come back. They were told they would. They weren't because they basically were told that what they were saying wasn't really in their best interest. Thank you for your time."}], "public_hearings_3": [], "public_hearings_4": [{"start": 4307.918, "speaker": "SPEAKER_14", "text": "Good evening. I am Margaret Posher. I'm the managing member of Prentice Partners of Ann Arbor LLC and South Town by Forum LLC. Based on the most recent campaign of misinformation that has found its way into the zoning proceeding, we find it necessary to clarify the ongoing use of 830 Henry Street and the issue of Airbnbs in our developments.  In a planning commission meeting held late in 2018, we described the planned use for 830 Henry as being for, quote, young professionals, graduate students, and recent grads. The motivation behind this use was simple, to create a place where this cohort could create a foothold in Ann Arbor as they launched a new job, a new enterprise, or the next stage of their professional education. A great deal of research supported this strategy.  830 Henry passed its certification of occupancy in early 2021. While COVID was the justification for many businesses to completely change their course of direction, especially those that required people to be in close quarters, this use plan was not abandoned. Having made the commitment at Planning Commission to house young professionals, graduate students, and recent grads, this continued to be the 830 Henry occupancy focus.  Sometimes these occupants stay for weeks and many times they stay for months. This commitment included digital tools to attract and invite individuals and startups that fit the use plan. At the end of the day, we realized because of consumer habits that the best method to attract occupants was through the Airbnb booking platform. Simply put, this platform is used for far more than vacation rentals.  and people are using it more and more for longer term rentals. 830 Henry still uses its own digital tools to book occupancy. The vast majority of occupants are U of M graduate students, professors, athletes, and coaches, as well as new startup teams. I don't believe that at the 2018 Planning Commission meeting, there was a great deal of concern about what technology would be used to fill the units.  I think the concern was, would this development support the housing needs of Ann Arborites? Per current regulation, this means people who live in Ann Arbor for 31 days or more. Some 830 Henry occupants stay for less than 31 days, and many stay for far longer. I would ask council members not to get caught up in hot button terminology, for example, Airbnb, used by people who are trying to run council from the outside. Thank you."}, {"start": 4489.873, "speaker": "SPEAKER_08", "text": "I want to talk about something very positive tonight. My name's Heidi Posher. The South Town Sustainable Energy System will set a benchmark  for sustainable building construction and ongoing clean energy production at a state, regional, and national level. Sustainable benefits of the Southtown project relate to a built environment constructed to optimize energy efficiency and the activation of occupant participation in programs to reduce and preserve energy.  The project incorporates renewable on-site energy generation, as well as a microgrid designed to coordinate all of these components into a holistic, sustainable energy system. Southtown is designed with enhanced carbon lifecycle building materials that include mass timber, a building envelope that accounts for solar and heating patterns across four seasons, a geothermal system that exchanges heat between the building and the site to greatly diversify the impact of HVAC load,  and green rooftops to avoid the creation of heat islands. The bedrock of the sustainable energy system is Southtown's microgrid control system, which will manage and reduce campus load and optimize the integration of the sustainable energy resources to targeted objectives. This is so, so important because it provides a level of control that almost every building doesn't have.  These objectives, these targeted objectives include reliability, as in the ability to disconnect from the grid when necessary and allow the occupants to shelter in place, as well as net zero emissions. Under this design, it will actually be possible to run the entire development as a carbon negative footprint. I really want to emphasize that. The objective of the Southtown microgrid design is 100% uptime and carbon negative operation  completely eliminating the 3,600 pounds of CO2 emissions that pollute our environment with every megawatt hour of electricity that's delivered. We can do this while still preserving an all-electric campus. Ann Arbor's a clear leader in municipality-driven  sustainability in the United States. Southtown presents a unique opportunity for area residents to live their strong commitment to curbing climate change in the most meaningful way possible. I'd respectfully ask council to make sure that we're not distracted by other issues and we're focusing on what really matters here.

There were eight apartments there. They are now all short-term rentals.  And we can surmise then that short-term rentals bring in a lot more money than regular rentals. But it's my position that they take away from housing that is apparently very much needed in Ann Arbor.

And I also live at 1420 and next door to this former apartment building, which as of, I don't know, four or five years ago, became a complete Airbnb thing. It's owned by the people who just spoke to you.  And they created this Airbnb place without consulting with us, without telling us anything. And all of a sudden, the permanent tenants were gone. Many of them were our real neighbors. They stayed years. And now we have no neighbors. It's actually nine units because there's a big, big unit in the basement. So there are nine units sitting there in the middle of a residential area.  that is all Airbnb and it just kind of popped up and nobody said anything. The people in my neighborhood don't even know that it's an Airbnb and so  I know that most of you ran for city council on affordable housing in Ann Arbor, more affordable housing. And now you've got nine units just taken away by these people who I think have treated us quite badly.  And I see them now moving to do something else on the South Park thing. And I noticed that there's 30 percent.  Airbnb built into that proposal. And so I say to you, I mean, all of you ran on more affordable housing, and you're doing things that are counterproductive to more affordable housing in Ann Arbor.

She has spent a great deal of time educating me, so I'll try to do her justice. With the adoption of reforms in the state of Michigan that allowed an expansion to ballot access to  absentee voting and to early voting. The logistical challenges of administering an election in a city like Ann Arbor and across the street have become extremely complex. The majority of our voters vote by absentee ballot now. Before the reforms of 2018, most, if not all certainly, but the vast majority of ballots were cast at a polling place on election day.  and the counting and sorting occurred in those individual precincts. Now, the majority of our ballots are cast as absentee ballots, which requires a, like I said, very complex logistical operation to keep voter registration forms, which can now be filled out up to and on election day.  absentee ballot request forms, absentee ballots themselves, voted absentee ballots, all of the workflows and physical processes to administer these forms have to be physically separated from each other to keep these flows from intermingling with each other and getting mixed up. And they have to be separated by ward and precinct as well. And so it creates,  There's a need for an immense amount of physical space to properly administer an election in the state of Michigan now. Before 2018, all of that administration happened right here, actually, the clerk's office behind you and in this council chamber.  And it was easily managed. Over the last several elections, we've had to commandeer space outside of City Hall. In 2020, when the public schools were closed, we used the Huron High School gym as an absentee ballot count board space, 4,500 square feet.  It was a wonderful place for us to hold an absentee ballot count board, but once the schools reopened, we don't have access to a space like that in City Hall. So we are constantly kind of bubble gumming space together to make sure that we have a secure facility to process these ballots.  We've also had to commandeer city facilities to create high security ballot storage, which is not something we've had to do in the past. Every election, we have to change where that location is, which means moving a lot of cameras and re-keying doors and things of that nature. It would be ideal if we could have that in one space. We also have high precision, very sensitive ballot counting equipment, which is meant to be stationary.  But with our current operation, it has to be moved into storage and out of storage to ballot counting locations every election. And so it's important for us to really solidify a space for our election administration. As our elections have changed, as, you know, threats to our elections have changed over the last eight years, it's become very important for us to  change how we interface with our election processes as well and kind of modernize how we do things and bring them up to a you know 2024 standard."}, {"start": 12133.247, "speaker": "SPEAKER_12", "text": "Sure. So as we began identifying facilities for an election center, one of the physical attributes you need in a building is large open space. As I said, the absentee ballot count board we had in 2020 was a 4,500 square foot basketball court.  You know, in total, the space we need for the election center, I think we estimated it to be between 12,000 and 14,000 square feet, depending on the configuration. But it was difficult to find buildings of that size that also had large open spaces and didn't need a lot of structural work to open them up. And we realized that if we wanted a building with those open spaces, we need to think a little bigger.  and started thinking about other city operations that could potentially partner into this building, and CTN is a natural partner. You know, something the community may be aware of is a lot of people are cutting their cable cord, and our CTN, Community Television Network operation, is funded with PEG fees, which are fees that individual cable subscribers pay into our CTN fund.  As those revenues are declining, we need to find ways to operate CTN in a more economical way. Right now, we lease space. We believe that moving them into this building in a new studio that is purpose-built for maybe a different production future and different operational future for CTN also has the opportunity to save them operating expenses on their facility, potentially more than 50% savings in annual operating expenses.  It's an exciting opportunity for CTN to have new studios and for the CTN fund to be a little more sustainable."}]}
