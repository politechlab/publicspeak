I'm here because energy is really important to me, and I'm really interested in the resolution that's being proposed. I'm really happy to see the enthusiasm, and I feel like as a city, we're moving in the right direction.  But I have a concern about, well, I'd like to say first, I really appreciate being able to talk with Dharma Ackman and Jen Iron, my reps, after the storm about many of the issues that we see in the resolution. But I do have a concern about DTE being invited to the table, that clause being invited to the Energy Commission. And I would hope that somebody could explain to me why that is and what the intent of that is.  I personally don't see that they deserve to have a seat at the table. What I would like to point out is also, and I'll get around to this, but in terms of the resolution, I think it's great to try to work with the state, but we also have an opportunity as a city to create our own municipal utility and bypass dealing with a state. And I'd like to point out the state has not been effective in regulating DTE. If you look at the MPSC,  They said themselves in an October 25th press release, 2022, over the past decades, the MPSC has issued a series of directives in response to widespread outages after storms. While there are important efforts underway, the reality is that we still haven't seen improvements in reliability and safety that Michigan customers deserve.  That's our own commission saying that. When we talk about the legislature, a report from the Energy and Policy Institute reports that 138 out of 148 state senators accept money from DTE. Governor Whitmer accepts more money than any other state elected official. We can bypass the state and work at a city level. And we have the opportunity to do that. We have the legal right to do that.  So I think that's something I'd really like to see us do. The feasibility study will show us what options we have. But I would like the clause about DTE at the table to be removed. I don't think they have acted in good faith with our state and with our city.

I live on Ember Way in Ann Arbor, as I have lived here for the past 40 years. As we've all seen way too clearly the last two weeks, DTE has failed us. Thank you for taking a first step towards demanding accountability for these unacceptable electric outages.  This was completely predictable and largely preventable. DTE can be relied upon to be unreliable, and this is nothing new. Over 40 years ago, then Detroit Edison made a business decision to focus on shareholder value instead of reliability and customer service, and it shows.  One summer in the late 1980s, Detroit lost power. My healthy 93-year-old grandma sergeant became hyperthermic in the heat and humidity of August without air conditioning. She was taken to Sinai Hospital, where she lapsed into a coma and never regained consciousness.  In 2006, we experienced one of our frequent power outages in my neighborhood. My son's buddy's little sister had developed a progressive muscular dystrophy, which left her dependent on breathing equipment at night. I asked the DTE supervisor cruising through our neighborhood, can you get this family some help? Their little girl can't breathe at night without power. The reply? If she can't breathe, she should go to a hospital. That family moved away.  Last week, I found another DTE supervisor driving through a nearby neighborhood and asked, what was causing our four plus day power outage? He said, it is the trees. Tell your neighbors to trim their trees. My neighborhood has underground utilities. Our trees are not guilty.  The callous disregard for the health and safety of the customers cannot be accepted one more day. It is literally a matter of life and death, particularly in winter and summer when babies under six and the elderly cannot regulate their body temperature at a safe level, but any time of year for people who rely on electricity for medical equipment and safe storage of life-sustaining medicine.  I urge you, the council, to join with Washtenaw County and the city of Pontiac to proclaim that this pattern ends here. In 2013, the city of Lansing experienced a catastrophic ice storm with prolonged outages. The citizens called on their municipal utility that is accountable to them, the citizens, to ensure that this would never happen again. Here is the report.  outlining all the changes they made. And no, it is not just the trees. They have not had a major power outage since. These last two storms resulted in fewer than 100 of 100,000 customers out of power briefly. Accountability matters. Either we demand better or we pull the plug on DTE and take the power into our own hands. Thank you."}, {"start": 1142.346, "end": 1145.147, "speaker": "SPEAKER_28", "text": "Thank you.

It spells out the many ways in which we need to hold VTE accountable for its lack of reliability during the recent ice storm and during the snowstorm that followed. Hundreds of residents in Ann Arbor and in Southeast Michigan  lost power during both storms, some for as many as eight days, a few even longer. We should all be outraged at DTE's lack of preparation for these ever more extreme weather conditions. I propose one small amendment to the resolution, and that is to remove the clause stating that DTE should, quote, attend regularly scheduled Energy Commission meetings to provide updates on what DTE is doing  to improve the resilience of its infrastructure with a focus on energy justice and decarbonization.\" The Energy Commission has the power to call on DTE to speak at its meetings and to get updates at any time. To allow DTE to be always present at Energy Commission meetings gives DTE the opportunity to push forward its PR campaign to greenwash what it's doing and not doing.  So I suggest amending the resolution to remove this one clause. But again, I thank council members Ghazi, Edwin, Sung, and Harrison for putting this resolution forward.

I had my power restored on the ninth day of outage, and just five hours later, my power failed once again due to the snowstorm. I'm calling in because I would like to commend Council Member  Ghazi Edwin, Song, and Harrison as well for their resolution calling on greater accountability for DTE within the Michigan Public Service Commission, legislature, and at the city level. I think that it's incredibly important that we all use this tragedy, this mass power outage, to really demand change for something that has been going on for far too long.  DTE has made the strategic decision to invest in our politics rather than their infrastructure. They're the 430th utility. They're one of the most expensive utilities. And as we all just saw, they're one of the most unreliable, with up to nine-day outages followed by even longer outages that have not been fully resolved. Meanwhile, public power utilities like Lansing, Chelsea, Wyandotte all had very short-lived outages or none at all.  The difference is clear between public power and private utilities. And I think that other people across the state are looking to Ann Arbor and seeing that we have taken the steps forward to start to break free and are trying to follow in our example. It's incredibly important that we continue to move along this process to give hope to others in the state that we no longer will have to live under the rule and callous regime of DTE. So I would like to thank  the commission, the council members, apologies for introducing this resolution. However, I would, as other speakers have stated, recommend that it be amended to remove the clause, adding a permanent speaking position to the energy commission meetings for DTE. DTE has already proven that they are willing to lie about their investments in their infrastructure, bragging just a day after the outage, their shareholders about how they  saved $100 million by deferring tree trimming and plan to continue deferring maintenance to keep their budget lean, all the same time while bragging about reliability upgrades to the press. We simply can't allow them to keep spreading this type of misinformation within our city government. We need to remove their lobbying capabilities and we need to break free from them so that we can start to build a resilient and sustainable energy grid that will carry us through the climate crisis.

Derek Miller, resident of Ann Arbor on Pauline Boulevard, and also speaking on behalf of Community Action Network. There has been a widespread disruption to services for under-resourced families with pockets of outages still persisting. In fact, just two days ago, a community resident had reached out on behalf of their 89-year-old neighbor, still without power. By reaching out to our contacts at DT, we were fortunately able to get a team out there to prioritize the repair. Although this response was to the benefit of this elderly resident,  it is symptomatic of a broken system requiring clout for resolution. Loss of food security resources as well as the ability to distribute was seriously compromised and we are the largest distributor in partnership with food gathers in Washtenaw County. Scrambling to meet emerging needs in light of uncertainty of when power would return, this led to emergency actions from dozens of nonprofits as well as municipal staff to enact remediation strategies on an already stretched system.  For example, can establish an emergency food distribution distributing over 7,000 pounds of food and over $5,000 in gift cards. The city in partnership with can and other partners also set up several warming centers, including overnight warming centers, one of which was at the north side for you center, which is one of the universe few resiliency hubs. With expectations that severe weather will only become more volatile. We are far from experiencing challenges to our grid other and other life saving resources.

I'm also the founder of A2 Collaborative, a local design development firm that, along with local engineering and architectural services, played a role in the early and ongoing project design. I know that this is the first reading for this PUD rezoning,  but I wanted to take the opportunity to introduce and summarize the project and talk about some of our various features. Our team worked diligently to blend elements of sustainability, affordability, community connectivity, and also a reduced reliance on auto-related infrastructure. In fact, our design has an approximately 82% parking to unit ratio.  Not only do these design features, these are important to A2 Collaborative as a firm, but we also believe that they are valued by the community and the city of Ann Harbor. Through our efforts, I believe that we have put together a project that will have a meaningful impact on addressing the lack of housing in the city, as well as producing and allowing for units that will remain  forever affordable at a 60% AMI level. Our project is located on a major trunk line that has access to other parts of the city and the project includes a clubhouse that is dedicated to bike storage and maintenance as well as e-bike charging. The building itself will use far less energy  than a traditionally designed code built apartment complex. And we believe that this plays a role in reducing our carbon footprint and angling towards a less intensive carbon intensive future.  Our building will be all electrified. We will offset a percentage of our energy usage through photovoltaics. And we will have a built-in level of resiliency through a geothermal design that has been incorporated into the courtyard and the parking lot.

My name is Ralph Marcus and I represent Earhart Village Association, the 174 unit owners. There are members of the community either requesting to speak tonight or watching or on the call.  We asked to have input in the engineering department's plans for the sidewalk that's contemplated with the Earhart 2023 reconstruction prior to those plans being consulted and submitted, and we were not allowed to have that opportunity. We have asked to be formally advised of a processing track for the plans, for the preliminary plans, and quite frankly, no one from the city has responded, making  this process a little unfriendly, necessitating the use of the association's lawyer at a cost to the association to gain the attention of folks in the city. And we'd rather not proceed in that fashion, but it unfortunately has come to that. We've asked someone to provide a written response to the path of the meetings and schedule for processing and approving the project. And we've asked for those, we've submitted those questions to you all in writing.  Again, we have not had any response. We've made presentations at the Transportation Commission and the Planning Commission, and some of the responses that took place during those meetings were just inaccurate or untrue statements by the folks on those commissions. And I don't blame them, but they just don't have the necessary facts in front of them. We have presented objective rationales to why the planned sidewalk on the eastern side of Earhart Road is just another unconnected sidewalk to nowhere, probably in perpetuity.  The sidewalk can't be placed, as we understand it, in front of Botsford Cemetery. You cannot move the complicated utility equipment on the north end of our property. There's a conservation easement that has a partial sidewalk, which would have to be reconstructed. And that is where the planning commission said, well, the sidewalk's already there. Well, part of it is, but part of it's not. And there's a restriction in that recorded conservation easement, which precludes construction on that property.  Also, there's not any sidewalk apparently being contemplated between the two pine braze streets. So we're kind of at a loss as to why the sidewalk has become so important to the engineering department. If it was to be constructed, the sidewalk would damage critical root tree root and actually remove about seven trees and have to have root protection for a number 30 or 40. And we think that there's probably about 30 trees in total that would have to be removed.  The preliminary road improvement plan that was presented by engineering shows, and I'd like everyone to take note of this, on pages 21, 27, and 40, that the engineering department has this sidewalk, which is supposed to be in the right-of-way, extending into the private property of Earhart Village. I can assure you that Earhart Village has absolutely no intention of providing any authority for the sidewalk to be on its private property, and we do not want the sidewalk constructed.

Well, nobody opposed it because it wasn't even a factor in that project. So that's a ridiculous argument on behalf of the city. There's plenty of area in the existing roadway to put in two lanes of road, two bike lanes, and if you must have a sidewalk, put it in the existing area.  You said you can't move the curb. Well, I think you can. And in the way that our governor says things, move the damn curb. If you must have a sidewalk, don't impose it on the residents of Earhart village. Speed is also a factor here. And that was requested by the 300 reports that you got back from 2019. And I don't believe that the roundabouts will reduce the speed. So I am requesting that the speed limit be reduced  to 30 miles per hour, like it is on Glacier Way, as opposed to the 35 miles an hour that it is now. And I also hope that in this whole project, you address Green Hill School and our ability to exit and enter our driveway without obstruction during drop-off and pickup time.

I'm here to talk about a golf issue that we're having. My issue pales in comparison to no energy, but it's important to me and it's important to 50 other senior golfers that play at Leslie Park. In 2009, you adopted a resolution that set rates and restrictions for season passes and green fees.  Since that time, the green fees have been amended five times, each time by council approval. Season passes have never been brought forward for amendment. They remain as you adopted them in 2009. This year, amendments were made by staff that changed the original intention of the adopted resolution. For example,  Senior season passes specifically allowed we can play for senior golf the commentary section specifically says Now available for use on weekends This year Park staff changed that policy so that seniors can no longer play on the weekends We are not allowed to play at Leslie Park or  on Saturday and Sunday, unless we pay the daily fee, or by a full season pass, which costs $400 more, or a 67% increase. Seniors are the only ones impacted with these cost increases. That is not right. The change, I believe, is not in line with the original intention that council adopted in this resolution.  The second change that was made was to limit the use of a full pass. A full pass allowed users to play seven days a week anytime. Now Parks is saying you cannot play on weekends until after 12. You would think that's no big deal. But the resolution specifically states it's a full pass. It does not allow for restrictions. For me, the cost I estimate to play on the weekends, because I play in the mornings, will be $1,500.  I will gladly pay that, but I'm going to pay that somewhere else if I have to, because I feel that passionate about the change that has been made that it is not right. And again, the change to the full pass does not meet the original intention of the resolution that you adopted. Another change is the original resolution included monthly, senior, full, and weekday passes. Those have not been offered in the four years that I've been in Ann Arbor. I don't know where they went.  The resolution you adopted allows it, but they've disappeared. I think they need to be reinstated and offered to the golfers as allowed by the resolution. I believe that the resolution binds the park staff to offer what was presented and approved. Staff should not be allowed to change the original intent of any resolution that you adopt.  The changes currently made by parks were never presented to the public, and we hope that you do something about trying to get these back in order.

I want the council to be advised that Earhart Village in no manner, shape or form proposes or provides that the city of Ann Arbor with any permission to trespass onto our private property for the construction of a contemplated and unwanted sidewalk. A properly circulated and documented petition of over 100 residents of Earhart Village has been formally submitted along with the board resolution  and narrating cover letter objecting to the subject sidewalk. We asked the clerk to accept the petition and the accompanying documents. Bearheart Road needs to be repaved.

Notwithstanding, we would rather collaborate with the city for an amicable solution and invite all parties to a meeting to reconsider the existing plan. I'm most concerned about the fact that we have attended all the community meetings regarding this project, beginning in April, 2019 through December, 2022, to express our opposition to the construction of this sidewalk.  We have written to the mayor, to the city attorney, the city administrator, the public service manager, planning manager, council person, and others, and no one, not one person has responded to us.

We pay our taxes. Where is our representation?  We believe the sidewalk is unnecessary because the sidewalk already exists on the other side of the street. And there is no requirement in Ann Arbor for sidewalks on both sides of the street. You've already heard about the many gaps that would exist between the Pine Gray streets in front of Botsford Cemetery and on our conservation easement. And we do not believe that the 1972 sanitary sewer easement previously granted  gives the city the authority to construct on our private property. Our ISA certified arborist noted in his recent inspection that not only will an unsightly retaining wall be required due to the grade, but removing large tree roots can make our remaining trees unstable and a hazard to the homes behind them. The construction activity will stress the remaining trees, making them susceptible to insects and diseases, causing death and decline. And on top of that,  The tree canopy in our neighborhood has already been severely impacted by the development of the Concord Pines subdivision where over 1,000 trees were recently destroyed. We believe the city's plan will diminish our livable community by increasing air and noise pollution."}, {"start": 2672.301, "end": 2681.944, "speaker": "SPEAKER_28", "text": "Our next speaker is Mojan Savabiasafani."}, {"start": 2683.612, "end": 2871.266, "speaker": "SPEAKER_45", "text": "Hello Ann Arbor.

They represent the rich in this town who get to say what goes on and what doesn't go on because they got paid for their campaign, big, huge campaign support that they got.

I'm here to tell you the amount of suffering that you endured in the past few weeks because of electricity disconnection, et cetera, et cetera.  does not compare even in the slightest to the amount of torture, electricity-less days, the torture and murder of Palestinians that your tax dollars every year purchases. Every year, American tax dollars  pays the apartheid state of Israel $4 billion. That money goes into cutting people's access to water and electricity off, torturing people on the streets, shooting young people, et cetera, et cetera.  So that was the background. Last time when I was here, Ms. Ayesha Ghazi declared that she is a member of the Human Rights Commission in this town, and she has never seen this proposal, which we have been bringing here for 20 years, that we want no military aid to Israel. We are against military aid to Israel.  We have been asking for this to be approved by the city council. Ms. Ghazi says that she has never seen that come to Human Rights Commission. Well, that tells me one thing. She has no idea what goes on in Human Rights Commission. It also tells me she has absolutely no care for any kind of human rights.  least of all Palestinian people. And those are the reasons why she's sitting on that chair, and those are the reasons why she's sitting on Human Rights Commission, because she's clueless and she cares nothing for human rights. If she did, she would know that we did go Human Rights Commission in 2019, exactly when she said she was on that commission.  And we demanded it multiple times. If she cared about human rights, she would know that the top, top issue of human rights communities all over the world is the Palestinian human rights. And if she cared about human rights, she would bring her own resolution to protect people of Palestine.  She doesn't give a rat's ass about human rights or about the commission.

I live at 621 5th Street, and I am an environmental commissioner, but I'm speaking for myself tonight. I want to encourage all households and businesses to contact the Michigan Public Service Commission, because as you're considering in the resolution DC-5 tonight, electricity is an essential service, and DTE does not deserve the requested rate increase that it has made.  In our house, we experienced two back-to-back power outages in the last two weeks, triggered by ice and wet snow, but actually caused by poorly maintained DTE infrastructure. DTE admits that it deferred maintenance in its 2022 year-end earnings conference call. You can find it by Googling its earnings conference call and see pages 10 and 11, on which deferred maintenance is highlighted as a feature of earnings for 2022 and is planned for 2023.  We're lucky here. We were cold, but safe and concerned. We only had 80 hours without electricity over the two events. I witnessed firsthand a wire that dropped to the ground behind our house on Friday, March 3, that sparked throughout the night until noon on Saturday. Firefighters assessed the situation early on, determined that it was not critical, and called DTE. It wasn't to be a repair. A DTE safety staffer sat in a car idling  at the head of a dead-end street watching it to the wire to be sure that people did not approach the unsafe wire. At noon on Saturday the power was cut and the repair of power was completed 24 hours later on Sunday. We heard about people's loss of work expenses for spoiled food and obtaining food that did not need to be cooked during the outage as well as costs for hotel rooms when available many of which were priced excessively. Please add the cost of Ann Arbor firefighter time that was not available for other fire emergencies in the city  due to the need to check on the many downed hot wires, the cost of warming centers, and other emergency services in the city. Those costs add up and they should be charged directly to DTE. We appreciate the service of all the technicians and electricians who helped return our power. We're not pleased with how DTE management appears to depend on ignoring maintenance to gain the financial return for its investors and simultaneously ask for higher rates.  In Bridge Magazine, it's reported on February 10th that DTE asked the MPSC for permission to increase its yearly revenues by $62 million, representing a 14% residential rate increase. At the same time, DTE reported a $1.1 billion gain to its investors. What the heck? Search for MPSC on the eDocket. Once on that page, search for case number U21297.  click on submit comment and tell the MPSC to deny the rate increase requested by DTE and set a procedure to make DTE accountable to its customers ahead of its investors. I agree with the resolution that you're considering tonight and agree with the prior speakers that you remove the resolve clause relating to DTE as a regular participant in the Energy Commission. DTE should not influence our Energy Commission recommendations  They're extremely good at crafting influential messages that distort actual services received."}, {"start": 3424.829, "end": 3439.438, "speaker": "SPEAKER_28", "text": "Our first 15 speakers having spoken to us and provided their public comment within a time less than the 45-minute period, we now go on with public comment overflow.

I live at State Street Village Apartments. And part of the reason why I'm here today is because I've lived in a lot of areas, but this is the first time where I'm paying as much in rent as I have been. I'm paying as much in utilities as I have ever. And the first time I've ever been without power for more than six days. And that's why today I want to talk about a critical issue that affects us all, power outages. Power outages are a major inconvenience, and they can have devastating consequences for businesses, hospitals, and homes.  They disrupt our lives, compromise our safety, and harm our economy. But what causes these power outages? One of the main reasons is the failure of privately owned electric utilities to invest in infrastructure and modernize their power grids. Private utilities often prioritize their profits over the needs of their customers, which can lead to the neglect of the system, resulting in blackouts and brownouts.  It's time to recognize that electricity is a basic human need and should be treated as a public good, not a commodity for private profit. We need a public ownership model for our electric utilities, one that puts the needs of the peoples first.  Public ownership of electric utilities means that the community, through its elected representatives, owns and controls the electrical grid. This model ensures that the utility is run in the interest of the public and not for private gain. It also means that the public can hold those in charge accountable for their actions, something that has been severely lacking.  In addition, public ownership of electrical utilities would lead to greater investment in infrastructure, making the power grid more reliable and less vulnerable to outages. It would also create jobs and economic opportunities in our communities, as local workers would be employed to maintain and upgrade the system.  Some argue that public ownership of utilities would be inefficient, but the evidence suggests otherwise. Municipal utilities, which are owned by local governments, consistently outperform private utilities in terms of reliability, affordability, and customer satisfaction.  In conclusion, power outages are a serious problem, and we need to take action to address them. Public ownership over electrical utilities is the solution. It will ensure that the needs of the people are put first, and that our power grid is reliable, modern, and sustainable. Let's work together to make this a reality.

They're gonna continue to do that, whether it's complaint based through the number or whether they discover it while they're on patrol. They're also planning to send a letter to all the delivery companies, so like UPS, Amazon, FedEx, informing them of our bike lane ordinance and letting them know that we're actively enforcing it.  Also, we are going to implement a process by which citizens can make a report to community standards with a photo with a license plate and a date, time, and location of the incident. And the city will send a warning letter to the registered owner of the vehicle that says that future infractions may result in a ticket.  They're going to be working with transportation signs and signals to get additional signage installed where there isn't any, especially protected bike lanes. And then last but not least, what I'm very excited to see on our agenda tonight is tiny street sweepers, snow plows. The purchase is going to allow us to maintain the single track bike lanes.

Moreover, it assumes, quote, all new residential and commercial buildings are designed and built to operate without the use of natural gas.  As to housing, Ann Arbor urgently needs more housing, especially affordable and workforce housing. City Council has approved two housing-related goals that I know of. First, in 2015, setting the goal of catalyzing 2,800 new affordable housing units by 2035. And second, in 2020, by approving the 820 plan, which in Strategy 2, Action 1,  targets catalyzing 2,000 new units of residential, multifamily, or ADUs, presumably including some of the affordable housing units from the first goal. City Council has never declared a housing emergency. So where do we stand on our housing and climate goals? Since the A20 plan was approved, 2,600, approximately 2,600 new housing units have been approved or are in the approval pipeline.  In addition, the University of Michigan has announced it is building a 2300 bed dormitory with a second phase plan. A lot of new housing is being created. That's great. Unfortunately, at least 30 of the 46 new housing developments announced since the approval of the A20 plan will be natural gas connected.  The Village of Ann Arbor's 440 planned garden apartments in two phases are among them. They all represent assets which will emit atmospheric sewage for at least 20 years. These emissions will undermine the A20 plan well beyond its 2030 target.  You know that all electric developments are financially and technically feasible. You've approved several of them. The village's development or the village development could be all electric, energy efficient,  and have low utility costs. DTE has publicly stated it can provide the required electric grid infrastructure. My former employer, Bosch, in response to an inquiry that I made a week ago, stated in writing that it has thousands of air source heat pumps in stock.  And finally, we know from an analysis of over 260 developments in Pennsylvania presented to the Energy Commission and provided to the Planning Commission that super energy efficient passive house certified  May I continue? Of course. Okay, thank you. That super energy efficient passive house certified multifamily projects with low utility costs are being built at or below the cost of code compliant ones. There is no reason to approve the village project tonight.  Moreover, it makes no sense to provide $31 million in brownfield incentives when the project does not include any affordable housing units and it will be heated with natural gas. Do not approve this project in its current form. No one would approve new developments which discharge liquid sewage. Why approve this one?  A short delay on this project is worth the short-term impact on new housing availability. Thank you very much.

And this zoning, this R4C that this is being requested for is as bad as the R  are one that it came in as when it was annexed in from the township. And I think it needs to be made clear to everybody, the public and the council, that this developer has no right to this zoning request. It's a request and we definitely have the right to say no to something like this, especially if it's not what we're looking for. And as the previous speaker made quite clear, it certainly isn't what we're looking for.  The concerns that I've heard in the community that, well, if we don't give them this, they'll do a buy right R1C, I think that that's an unsubstantiated consideration. This council has made so many efforts, substantial efforts, to do away with R1 zoning that I would hope that you would defend against R1 zoning going on this site. This needs something better. This needs a new zoning designation that we should have put in place when we redid our master plan, which is now called the comprehensive land use plan, thankfully. And we should have redone that plan  2018-2019 for various reasons that got delayed and we didn't. Saying no to this zoning request is an opportunity to reconsider and correct the past's vision, our vision of the past that's reflected in a tired and inappropriate zoning designations. What is left in our master plan, our comprehensive land use plan, is just been rehashed and rehashed over and over.  And it's not what we need. It's not what we needed 20 years ago even, but we're going to let that go. So I think it's very important that we say no when a bad project comes before us and give ourselves the opportunity to correct errors we may have made in the past or just write the ship of state as new information comes to light. I'd like to see a better zoning designation for R4E and E for environmental.  Now, there's so many things that are wrong with this. If you read the staff report on just the zoning, how it's going to destroy the already terrible intersections around it, how it's going to add to traffic, how it's going to be a big carbon waste because we don't have the proper zoning in place.  The thing that's shocking to me about this is this represents more than a quarter of the area of our downtown, and it is twice the size of the original University of Michigan campus. And to think that that would go unplanned or planned by a developer who's just going to shoehorn something in that doesn't even belong in a cornfield, Northfield, no offense, into our fine community, really essentially 80 acres here because they own the other adjacent parcels, it's a tragedy. And this is an opportunity to set that straight and rethink this project.  I think you should really give it some thought. It's important to the community."}, {"start": 4799.708, "end": 4810.495, "speaker": "SPEAKER_27", "text": "Thank you."}, {"start": 4810.495, "end": 4992.054, "speaker": "SPEAKER_17", "text": "Thank you, Mayor Taylor. Ken Garber, 28 Hammer Hill Court. I respectfully disagree with Mr. Hayner. I think the R4A zoning, which I think is what's on the table, is entirely appropriate for this site.  We want higher density, multifamily housing where possible, but not at the expense of our 820 plan. As Mr. Murski said, the plan explicitly calls for no natural gas connections and new construction. And it assumes all electric, excuse me, all electric net zero energy buildings starting in 2022.  The village's 320 apartments will generate, by my estimate, 2,064 metric tons a year of CO2-equivalent emissions just from burning gas. Gasoline savings from converting commuters to village residents will offset only about one-fifth of the damage. One benefit of high-density development is fewer emissions, but gas furnaces completely defeat the purpose.  As architect Jan Culbertson said at the recent CCL-OSI forum on housing, transportation, and climate, quote, we cannot invest in legacy carbon emissions, end quote. Please think about what we're doing. The climate does not care about solar panel contracts, climate millages, or carbon neutrality target dates. The climate only cares about one thing, the raw physics, the molecules of CO2 and other greenhouse gases we're putting in the atmosphere.  That's it. And in that respect, we as a city are failing. Last month, I think you got the report that I put together on new developments and the 30 gas burning projects that Mr. Murski referred to, when complete, will generate about 24,000 metric ton CO2 equivalent emissions from gas combustion alone.  This is more than quadruple the estimated 5,700 metric tons of annual emissions that will be prevented through the combination of solarized installations, the pending solar at city facilities contract, and the Homeland Solar Parks contract. Reduced commuter traffic will only offset about 1 7th of these emissions. So we're not just violating 820, we're wiping out these renewable energy gains and putting the city's emission reduction targets out of reach.  It doesn't have to be this way.  You heard a little earlier from Jeff Wilkerson on the North Maple PUD project. He has on the agenda for later tonight, 79 apartments, all electric, 90 kilowatts rooftop solar, geothermal, battery storage, wall and roof insulation superior to the village, affordable housing with 15% of units at 60% AMI. This project is everything the village is not. It can.  and is being done here and lots of other places."}, {"start": 4992.054, "end": 5005.379, "speaker": "SPEAKER_27", "text": "Thank you.

I think some of you didn't see me speak in front of you before.  6905 Telegraph Road. I'm representing the development team. It's been a long road to tonight. There's been a lot of discourse with neighbors, with staff, with public bodies over the course of the last three years. We're not the first to look at the property. In fact, we even have dropped it once ourselves. It's a very difficult property. There's a reason why there's 67 acres of land in the heart of Ann Arbor.  It's a landfill and there's a lot of cubic, there's about 1.9 million cubic yards of rubble and fill. So we have a lot that we're dealing with on the site. Again, that's why it's out there for so long.  I just want to give a few highlights. I'm not going to give obviously a whole presentation, but we really did see this as a village concept. We wanted to look at multiple price points, and I think we've done that. We've got home sizes from 684 square feet to 1,850 square feet, both rental and for sale. It does meet the surrounding zoning districts. It also meets the existing, the specific density and the future land use plan of Ann Arbor.  We're not asking for a PUD, we're asking for a straight zoning of R4A, and again, that meets the surrounding districts. We'll have multiple open space areas. We'll provide public connections between Olson Park and Leslie Park. Right now, there's really only one private entrance into Leslie Park. This would open that up for the public. We'll have about 65% open space and significant wetland preservation.  It's a walkable project over a mile of pedestrian bike paths, or sidewalks and bike paths. These are all open to the public. It's an appropriate mix of residential land use. It's within a targeted growth location. If you look on your master plan, it specifically calls for growth in this area. And we will have family-oriented plans. So again, we'll have that kind of mix of housing. It's a reclamation of a former landfill property. It's a very difficult property to work with.  Lots of green energy and initiatives a portion of it will be all electric. That's the for sale portion of it Significant portion of the property and we'll include energy efficient appliances. We'll have solar panels on the clubhouse We'll also have solar street lights throughout We'll have a contribution of about 1.2 million to the DuVarn and Pontiac Trail Road improvements over 300,000 and park improvements as well  High quality owner occupied homes and menatized apartment homes We are venturing with a very capable and reputable partner in DTN management And you know shameless self-promotion, but you know, we've been around a long time You know, I think we have a very good reputation. That's something that's very important to us And I think it's important to the city to know you have somebody that'll stand by the project So we're here to answer any questions Throughout. Thank you. Appreciate it. Thank you"}, {"start": 5198.243, "end": 5212.472, "speaker": "SPEAKER_28", "text": "Is there anyone else in house who would like to speak at this public hearing?

I'd like the previous builder to know exactly what it is like as they are building down a couple of blocks from my current residence  The traffic, the noise, and everything, just everything has increased. I find it a bit hard to believe that there was going to be additional development without an infrastructure change to Pontiac Trail. The noise level itself has increased, especially to near 23 and M14.  from 50 to 60 decibels to 70 to 80 decibels during peak time. The Pontiac Trail itself has become a drag racing strip from Polson going north past Duvarin. If you'd like to come out here during hospital shift change, you would be very interested in seeing the cars and hearing their engines open as they make their way down Pontiac Trail.  In terms of wildlife, unfortunately already we have forced them into small areas and then we kill them. Much like the inclusive city that Ann Arbor is, we have already killed deer and skunk and raccoons, just about every animal that you can think of within this  area of Montana Way and Pontiac Trail is already been affected.

I do think that electrification is, I'm  Kind of conflicted about this whole issue. I think the issue with transportation is a bigger issue, but electrification is great if it can work out.

And it flies in the face of the A20 plan that you all approved and supposedly we're so proud of. I know it's difficult, but I'm sure that there are ways you can incentivize developers better. As I think one or both of those speakers mentioned, there are examples here in Ann Arbor  of less prominent developers who have made it work. Like Viridian for one example, and that's not the only example, that one on Maple Road. There's many examples. We can incentivize developers somehow.

The trade-offs that we're seeing here are either we can provide this housing all within the city limits,  where the city will get tax revenue from it, where we will be able to provide public transportation and bike networks and walkability. And yeah, maybe we'll have to have more gas around for a while. Or the alternative is where we can let those same people who aren't just going to magically disappear  buy or rent their housing out in the townships, where the city won't get the tax revenue, where they have much laxer laws on things like gas appliances and stuff, and where they're going to be pushed far more to drive more, which  honestly is a bigger deal for pollution in the city. So would I like to have an all-electric development there? Absolutely. I would love it. I really, really would.

So at least one of the previous speakers  Mentioned that the city hosted a housing and climate change forum a couple of weeks ago. And I think the biggest thing I took away from that session is dense multifamily housing in cities is 1 of the best tools that we have to combat climate change. Because multifamily buildings are more efficient and because enabling folks to live near their jobs and have a variety of transportation options. Is is much better than the alternative.  But I also heard something else in that forum, which is that we need to be really careful about placing severe restrictions on developments in the city, unless we can do so in cooperation with the rest of our region. If Ann Arbor decides to require 100% electrified developments, and our neighbors in Sio Township and Pittsfield Township and so on don't do any such thing, then what is the net result of that going to be? It could backfire on us. So  we need to consider what the alternative scenario really is when we're making a choice like this. And so I heard Mr. Murski saying that we can do both. We can have successful 100% electrified developments without rendering them infeasible. And I want to believe that. It would be great if that's true. But I'm not sure I do believe that's true in every case on every single site.  And I certainly remember some previous instances with somewhat different context. We weren't talking about energy. But we have seen cases in the past where prior councils demanded too much of developers. The developers walked away and we got much worse by right projects instead. Or we might get nothing here and we'd only ramp up demand.  for sprawl out in the township, as I was saying before. So I just urge you all to be careful here not to make perfect the enemy of the good. This is certainly not a perfect project, but I think it's a net positive for Ann Arbor even so.

To me, it appears to be illegal under R4A zoning.  That's because the front setback along Duverin Road exceeds the 40-foot maximum front setback requirement. The developer needed the space to meet the 65% open space requirement under R4A. Planning Commission approval was conditional on the petitioner obtaining a variance from the setback requirement. To my knowledge, that variance has not been granted. So this plan, as it stands, looks illegal to me.  Now, the developer recently annexed some properties that will allow it to meet the open space requirement and fix the setback problem. But we have not seen that plan. The plan before us tonight has too big a front setback on DuVerin as I read it. But you should ask your staff. I'm not an expert on zoning. Before voting, I suggest that you settle this question.  Small point, your meeting agenda is incorrect when it says the Planning Commission voted 9-0 to recommend approval. The actual vote was 8-1, with Commissioner Ellie Abrams voting no. Many other commissioners were highly critical of this project. A few moments ago, Mr. Loughran described the positive features of this project.  They do exist, the 164 single-family homes that will be all electric, the streetlights that will be powered by solar, the solar clubhouse, the roundabout. Until today, I'd given the developer full credit for these positive amenities, and climate-friendly ones as well. Then I read the Brownfield Plan. It turns out, if you look at page 16 of the plan,  Mr. Loughran and his colleagues at Robertson Brothers are asking us, the public, to pay the incremental cost of the full electrification of the 164 for-sale homes, the electric streetlights, the, excuse me, the solar streetlights, the solar clubhouse."}, {"start": 6231.663, "end": 6237.946, "speaker": "SPEAKER_28", "text": "Mr. Garber, can I ask you to refer to the Brownfield plan during the Brownfield plan public hearing?"}, {"start": 6237.946, "end": 6287.673, "speaker": "SPEAKER_17", "text": "Of course.

I want to start by acknowledging that, you know, as I said many times, I think I said a couple years ago when we were seated as a new body that I think we have to acknowledge that this land doesn't belong to us in the first place. And so the idea that it's going to be insured for profit is really offensive to me. I spent the last 26 years within a mile of that site, living within a mile of that site. And the last three years within a stone, literal stone's throw of it, I'm working on some community garden projects up there.  And so it's a special parcel and it's a shame that 76% of the existing trees on it and 60% of the landmark trees on it are going to be, it's just, it's a clear cut like everything else we do around here. There's nothing special about this project. Before I get into the specific site plan things, I think we need to face up to the fact that no matter what we do, the townships are going to develop and they're going to develop in the way that they want to do.  And yeah, we haven't reached out, and we haven't done a proper partnership with the townships, and we haven't done proper planning in a regional way. But that's neither here nor there. We don't build it here. They're still building in the townships, because I get dozens and dozens of contracts lined up all through next year to repaint the builders' paint in these beautiful houses they're building out there, and also apartments and townhouses. We need housing. We need housing everywhere. I don't think that's a surprise.  The whole planet does. But not all housing is alike, and the city of Ann Arbor has prioritized its housing. This site doesn't have, this site has, it's typical, it's actually, I had some friends from other communities who follow council as closely as I do, and they wanted me to come up here and say this is an insult to this city and the residents, this project, no offense to the developers. This site has no net zero housing. This site has no low income housing.  It has no affordable housing. The site has no senior housing. It has no ADA accessible housing. It has no cooperative housing, no live-work housing, no group housing. We deserve better. This site plan is... I think the most offensive thing to some of my former constituents and my friends and neighbors at Arrowwood is the way that this is packed and clustered next to Arrowwood, that the large apartment units are massed  right up against the Arrowwood facility. But there's no notion of connecting those communities or creating cooperative communities. It's just a way to stuff the houses on this property. And the folks who say that perfect shouldn't get in the way of the good should recall that in many instances, we have said no to the not perfect and gotten better. And the finest example that I can recall, at least in my time on council,  the Lockwood development where we said no to a Lockwood on an inappropriate site on the west side, and we got a much larger and better project on the south side.

I did touch on the Brownfield, but I thought it was relevant to the site plan. I will speak to the Brownfield specifically. As you know, state law allows local governments to reimburse private developers for cleaning up contaminated sites using tax increment financing.  This is completely at the city's discretion. The village parcel has an old landfill that's emitting some methane. Under this brownfield plan, the landfill stays, but the developer puts in some specialized building foundations, passive venting systems, and a methane interceptor trench. It's asking for $31 million over 13 to 18 years. The $26 million to protect the residents from contaminants is necessary.  agree with that. But they're also asking for $5 million for non-environmental, non-remediation activities. Now, here's the thing. The city's brownfield policy requires that if such non-environmental activities are in the plan, the developer must provide affordable housing, 15% of units at 60% AMI. But there is no affordable housing here. Instead, the developer is substituting sustainability elements and a new roundabout for that affordable housing.  So your task tonight is to decide whether that tradeoff is worth it. Um, to me, it's not totally unacceptable, first of all, because this project is very unsustainable. It's not addressing climate change. It's contributing it to it. Yes, we've heard about the solar on this that powers the streetlights that's on the clubhouse and the heat pumps in the for sale units. But as I told you in the previous hearing, it turns out that  We're being asked to pay the incremental costs of all those elements and the roundabout. So the way I see it, they want us to pay for those environmental and traffic improvements, and yet they're saying we want to substitute those improvements for the affordable housing standard in the city brownfield policy.  They pay nothing, we reimburse everything, and they get to bypass the affordable housing requirement, as I see it. I mean, I wish I were wrong, and maybe I am, and I'm sure the developer will address this. Their view, I suspect, is that because the city did not require any of this stuff, the city should pay for it, not them. So you have to decide whether  You buy that. Here's what I think we should do. Offer the developer three options. Option one, add the affordable housing that city policy requires. Option two, remove the $5 million request for non-environmental activities. Or option three, do full electrification. Remember, the city has total discretion. We can set any condition we want. If they don't agree, then just take out the $5 million."}, {"start": 6834.306, "end": 6834.546, "speaker": "SPEAKER_27", "text": "Thank you."}, {"start": 6843.576, "end": 7029.528, "speaker": "SPEAKER_41", "text": "All right, one more time. I actually served on the Brownfield Board of Review when I was on council. And it's a pretty interesting thing. And it's at least as interesting as the insurance board, which I heard you're going to get rid of tonight. I don't know who's going to oversee that fund. I'm a little concerned about that. And because I also hear considering getting rid of Brownfield Board of Review. So I encourage you to read the Brownfield report and the conditions that have not yet been met for this to be approved, because there's several.  should not say yes to this until those conditions are in writing. As another caller and as the report points out, it's not really a cleanup. It's basically some advanced radon systems are going in these houses, some special foundations and some trenches and things like that. $31 million. So the polluter, multiple polluters, including the University of Michigan, who use this for landfill for decades, skate, and we pay for the supposed cleanup,  by foregoing tax revenue. And that's not right. The state gives us the authority to do this, but it doesn't require us to do this. It doesn't require us to subsidize any of this. And from an investment perspective of the city, it's a terrible idea to take, I know this is how it's supposed to function, but it's a terrible idea to give the developer a dodge for the first period of that tax payment when we should have that money in our bank earning interest  for the eventual support of this infrastructure that they're putting in. But that's the way that's going to go down. So it doesn't have MEDC support it needs. It doesn't have the tips capture agreement and start date in place. And it doesn't have the duration of that written in the agreement. Those are non-starters. This should not be approved. Now, I think that  We need to set aside, the council needs to set aside personal interest for the public interest on this matter. It's a big chunk of change we're giving out. I know that a lot of development happens in this community simply because council wanted property tax to play with. And that's fine, at some point this will be developed and it will be developed properly in a way that supports the sustainable commitment that we have made to this planet, supposedly. This isn't it.  And this so-called cleanup could come back and bite us in the future when everybody's sucking methane out of their basements, just like they're sucking dioxin. We should not be paying for polluter cleanups. Ann Arbor is a gem in this city, in this state. I think everybody knows that, and in this country. And we let it just turn to garbage.  We've been well below what we should be requiring our developers to get this kind of money And it's happened at lower town. It's gonna happen here. I hope it doesn't happen here.

Soils that you can build on up to 30 feet down into the ground.  And the Brownfield Statute in Michigan is really an economic development statute with an environmental focus. This site has had economic development challenges that have prevented its redevelopment.

And so, as part of the Brownfield process, which is typical throughout Michigan,  The focus is on due care, which means that it's redeveloped in a way that's safe for use.

We looked at what are the costs associated with actually cleaning the site up. That would be  something close to $100 million to get rid of all the material there. It's simply not realistic, but what is proven out at other sites throughout the state and throughout the country  are redevelopments using engineering controls to provide a safe environment for reuse.

As you are already aware, we will be speaking to this project three times tonight on our agenda. This first time we vote on the rezoning, so I will not go far into the project's details. This project, as you have heard, reclaims a former landfill site that has gone neglected and undeveloped for decades. It will create 484 units of housing,  with a second phase to come. This will be a mix of owner-occupied townhomes and apartment rentals at multiple price points. The developer has agreed to make the 164 single-family townhouse-style homes fully electric after a productive series of discussions with the Office of Sustainability and Innovation planning staff and the planning commission. In other words, the project didn't come in that way. The developer agreed to provide that amenity.  The garden-style apartments will rely on gas heating.  We've heard from many of you that since council is rezoning this project, we should make full electrification a condition of that rezoning. Rezoning, unless we are rezoning to a PUD, is not an opportunity for council to extract unlimited public goods. Our zoning decisions as a city must be consistent. We have been zoning projects near this location without requiring full electrification. We have no basis in law to do so.  That is the only question. It is not whether full electrification is feasible or whether the supply chain for heat pumps exists. It is whether we have a basis in law or not to require full electrification. This is something that I want.  But imposing it project by project on some projects but not others is neither a fair nor an effective way to get it. It must be established in code and law as a universal requirement and expectation for every developer who wants to build in Ann Arbor in the near future. The questions before us is whether the proposed R4A zoning is consistent with adjacent zoning surrounding land uses and with the land use element of the city's comprehensive plans.  The answers to these questions are yes. This does not mean that we hold our nose and vote for this project. Even without full electrification, there are other sustainability benefits to this project, foremost among them being that it reclaims a former landfill site that has gone undeveloped for decades and remediates it to the point where it is safe to house people there.  The housing that it will provide may turn some commuters into residents. It will certainly provide rental housing at lower than downtown prices, which is something the city sorely needs and is working very hard to encourage with TC1 zoning elsewhere in the city. It will also bring infrastructure improvements to Pontiac Trail. It will not degrade Pontiac Trail. It is one of the only mechanisms we have to bring needed infrastructure improvements.

And it is the units that it will provide are considerably smaller than those that will be provided by the other project that we have on the agenda. We are asked to rezone from township to PUD, which means that we need to be attentive to the public benefits  and to comparisons to the nearest existing zoning district. So this will be an all-electric development, and that's a major public benefit. This may be achieved, they are exploring it, by geothermal and heat pumps. Solar panels and batteries will offset 15% of the annual energy use of this project. To ensure effectiveness of the panels, this project will be insulated well in excess of our building code requirements,  They will have operable triple-pane windows, which is a benefit, and the developer has made provisions to collect composting in their solid waste enclosure should that service become available for multifamily dwellings. This project proposes 79 units.  It will be 25.24 dwelling units per acre, which seems like a silly number to give you, but I say it because it's very slightly above the maximum for the proximate zoning district, R4D, which is 25 an acre. So it's not a hyper-dense project, nor is it an extraordinarily tall project.  The maximum height of our 4D is 120 feet, and this project will be 55 feet or five stories, roughly.

It was brought to our attention not too long ago that there was, and I believe it was discussed briefly, a real need for some additional funding for eviction protection in the court systems. Working with the county and our staff, our finance staff, the Ann Arbor Housing Commission, we were able to identify that there was about $305,000  unspent funds from this year that were set aside for the year one high-impact grant fundings of the new Human Services Partnership. Due to some timing, COVID issues, and others, that that money was going to go unspent this year. We identified the ability to move that funding to the Housing Commission and allow them to partner with OCED, potentially some of their other partners, to distribute that fund, those funds, to those who need it most quickly. That is the resolution you have in front of you.  It is designed to distribute the funds immediately to the housing commission to let them do the work they do and to partner with the county to do that as well. So that is what we're designed to do.

I just wanted to speak a little bit about the homelessness here in Washtenaw County. The homeless crisis disproportionately affects people of color in Washtenaw County. There's approximately 60% of those experiencing homelessness that identify as black or African-American versus only 12% of black or African-American individuals that are in the county here of Washtenaw.  An eviction can appear on a renter's credit history for up to seven years, hindering their search for safe, affordable housing due to a ripple effect of negative consequences. But beyond displacement, the impact of an eviction can also cut a renter off from access to quality public transportation, getting them to school and work. The stress of the process and the upheaval of an abrupt move can also affect a tenant's mental health.  Where here in Washtenaw County, individuals experiencing homelessness with a mental illness have gone from approximately 50% to now over 80%. And with substance abuse skyrocketing somewhere near over 300%.  Studies have shown that evictions play an important role in the lives of low-income renter households and may also contribute to poverty through cascading disruptive effects such as job losses, adverse health effects, and negative consequences for children. In addition, if you become homeless after an eviction, you're also more likely to have encounters with law enforcement,  And once released Individuals are more likely to end up in a perpetual cycle of homelessness and law law enforcement encounters So I just want to say thank you to staff for putting this together working really quickly on this and Very very happy that this is happening."}, {"start": 9779.482, "end": 9781.103, "speaker": "SPEAKER_28", "text": "Thank you councilmember Watson"}, {"start": 9786.633, "end": 9869.71, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "text": "As a liaison to Housing and Human Services Advisory Board and the Human Services Partnership Leadership Team, I'm proud to be a co-sponsor of this resolution, which is in direct response to the family homelessness crisis in our city and county.

Most of these families have never entered the system and are at lower levels of need.  which likely illustrates that more people are experiencing crises related to current economic conditions, rising rents, and food prices. 76% of the families experiencing homelessness are Black female-led households. This is absolutely a racial equity issue.  Due to market conditions and larger average family size, it's become more expensive to house families and harder to find available units within the housing stock. This is why we want to prevent eviction where we can and why we're allocating the money to the Ann Arbor Housing Commission. While this funding is welcome, the need is great and we need more resources from our state and federal partners, especially as COVID relief funds expire.

So, you know, I just want to say that I knew when preparing this resolution with my colleagues that there were going to be people who felt that this wasn't going to go, that this wasn't going far enough. But I believe that us not saying anything tonight was not an option. Too many of our constituents have recently faced life-threatening emergencies due to prolonged outages.  This resolution is about energy justice and asks the Michigan legislature, Michigan Public Service Commission, and our city to work to improve regulation, accountability, and transparency of DTE, and for our city to continue to create equity-focused emergency response plans that prioritize vulnerable residents.  I want to thank Dr. Missy Stultz for contributing to this resolution from a climate perspective, Mr. John Fournier for sharing information on the state's role in this issue, our legal team, and Jennifer Hall for sharing information on how DTE impacts our affordable housing development. I want to thank my colleagues, Councilmember Cynthia Harrison and Lynn Song, for helping this resolution to center equity and focus on communities that have been historically disenfranchised from environmental and energy justice.  I also want to thank our city staff and emergency responders for working around the clock during the last two weeks of the recent weather events to keep our community safe. What drove myself and my colleagues to write this resolution is that during the last 12 days, you know, since the first ice storm on February 22nd hit, we have heard from so many constituents whose lives have just been upended.  I heard from a neighbor who lost power on February 22nd, and their power was up for six days, but due to caring for an ailing family member, they were unable to leave and forced to stay in their home while their thermostat hovered at 40 degrees. My Ward 3 colleague and I heard from a resident on Friday whose 89-year-old next-door neighbor had been without power for nine days, with another winter storm on the way that evening. The elderly neighbor was lucky enough to be able to stay with a family member, but not everyone has that luxury.  And I know that we've all heard from folks like this all over the city. But I want to remind us that these are just the people that have the privilege to contact us. I worry about the many who are struggling just to stay alive and didn't have the opportunity to reach out for help. And we know that people who are most marginalized are disproportionately impacted when outages occur.  Personally, I won't ever forget in 2019 when my own father father-in-law who is in hospice care at home had to be hospitalized. Not because his health took a turn for the worse, but because the power had gone out for five days and he was stuck in a hospital bed without access to necessary medical equipment. He needed to stay alive. It was traumatizing for him and it was traumatizing for all of us.  I believe that access to reliable electricity, especially in our climate and with climate change upon us, is a basic human right. And without it, people struggle to maintain employment and to stay alive. Our city has had numerous outages over the last three years that have lasted more than three days. And every time this occurs, we all end up being impacted and we all pay for it.  Am I over my three minutes? You are, I'm afraid. It's okay. Um, I just, I'll just end with saying, um, I think it's important and I welcome feedback and we have to keep DTE accountable."}, {"start": 10147.124, "end": 10151.667, "speaker": "SPEAKER_28", "text": "Further discussion."}, {"start": 10151.667, "end": 10258.929, "speaker": "SPEAKER_07", "text": "Councillor Song.

And it seems appropriate on the same day, just a couple hours, actually, more than a couple hours later than 4.30 at the Ford School to speak to this and DTE's role in  providing a service that I think We don't we think of as as an essential utility like water And clean air So, you know, I think councilmember Ishaq Ghazi Edwin and leading this effort and speaking directly to so many constituents who normally do not reach out to us who do not know who we are and  And I wish it wasn't for these reasons Where it's they're in crisis.

I think another important piece is just because there is so much energy work happening across the city.

These units will be designed  They will not be designed in a way that specifically targets students. This is not to say that students are not welcome to live in them, but that unlike some of the housing that we are seeing downtown, it is not developed as student housing. So that means that it's more flexible offerings, which is really important and important for us to get that outside of downtown.  So there will be 32 electric vehicle charging spaces, ENERGY STAR rated appliances throughout the development, and as the developer said, they are using a community concept, which means that though you will have people who own their homes and people who rent their homes,  All kinds of people living in this development. Everyone will have access to all of the amenities, including the clubhouse and the pool.

So as the staff report makes clear, it is correct that because a component of Brownfield TIF funding is dedicated to non-environmental uses for this project, the developer would normally be required to provide a 15% affordable housing  Component or payment in lieu now it is within the discretion of council to refuse to waive this requirement Which was waived by the brownfield committee?  Council should do that if council judges that this proposal does not offer enough benefits to justify the waiver. I believe the facts and benefits of the project justify a waiver. And I want to respectfully disagree with the statement that the public is paying for the public benefits, because here's how Brownfield TIF works. We have currently a blighted site that gives us zero tax revenue.  and the developer is up front paying close to $30 million to remediate  Actually, to remediate the site. I was going to say remediate and develop, and that's not correct. To remediate the site, and about one-sixth of that amount is going to go for the public benefits that I'll speak about in a couple seconds. What will happen is that in a fixed term of years, which is fixed at 18 but projected to end after 15,  and to begin in 2025, for a fixed term of years, we will not see increased tax revenue from this site. We are getting zero now. We will get zero for 15 years while the developer is reimbursed for the upfront costs of the environmental remediation, which makes the project developable. I think we will get some tax revenue. I see you guys, maybe. So yeah, so you can, no, I guess you can't speak.  So there will be some tax revenue that we will get, and staff, Mr. Delacorte, help afterwards, please, because I just messed up a little. But, so that's, I just wanted to correct, because I think that wasn't an entirely fair statement.  But the thing that I want to say is that this is not a patronage city, and it's very rare that we in Ward 1 get to approve something that is of real benefit for our constituents. And this project, though it has not caused all of the traffic problems on Pontiac Trail, is kind of the last project to the table in terms of North Pontiac. And so these developers were willing to,  put out an additional amount of money to supplement what the city will be getting through a grant application that it will make to install an urgently needed roundabout at Duvarin and Pontiac Road. This has been a project on the city's capital improvement plan. It hasn't been funded. There are no funds for it. Without the developers' help,  We would need to come up with over a million dollars, either from the general fund, or I'm not sure where else, because mostly everything else is committed.

Just a few brief comments. Just to clarify, there are a lot of good elements of this project. There are elements that could be better. This is definitely not the perfect being the enemy of the good. It is absolutely clear from engineering calculations that  Benefits from reduced commutes and reduced vehicle miles traveled are substantially less than the negative impact from this development burning natural gas. This development could go forward with some slight improvements, as I've suggested earlier. This is not a matter of canceling the project, not doing the project. This is a matter of improving on the project. It can be done. It is being done all over the place. It is being done in this city.  and it can be done with this project.

For my part, I'm excited to support the brownfield element, as I am excited to support the zoning in the site plan before it. Ann Arbor needs more Ann Arborites. This is a site that has been vacant for years because of its environmental contamination of being on top of a landfill and would not be able to be developed, and the community would not thereby have the benefit of more residents but for passage of the brownfield plan.  looking forward to supporting it today.
