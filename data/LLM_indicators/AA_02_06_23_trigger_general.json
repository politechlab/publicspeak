Proclamation regarding the Creative Campus Voting Project at the University of Michigan.  Whereas the Creative Campus Voting Project partnered with the City of Ann Arbor to open satellite clerk's office at the University of Michigan for the November 3rd, 2020 presidential election. And whereas they partnered with the City of Ann Arbor to open yet another office at the James and Ann Duderstadt Center for the period of 40 days leading up to the November 8th, 2022 midterm election.  and whereas the Creative Campus Voting Project, through the direction of Professor Stephanie Rhode and Professor Hannah Smarich, implemented design principles from the Stamps School of Art and Design to encourage and increase accessibility of voting participation and provided non-partisan ballot information for voters.  And whereas the Creative Campus Voting Project staffed by University of Michigan faculty and students helped facilitate 9,317 voter registrations in Michigan. And whereas those efforts further resulted in 13,109 absentee ballots being cast during the 2020 and 2022 elections. Whereas the Creative Campus Voting Project contributed to a culture of encouraging the civic participation that upholds our democracy by empowering voters.  Now, therefore, I, Christopher Taylor, Mayor of Ann Arbor, Michigan, do hereby recognize the remarkable efforts of the Creative Campus Voting Project at the University of Michigan, lots of C's there, to increase and encourage voting in the service of democracy in the city of Ann Arbor.

C1 on your agenda is likely your most important rezoning vote all year.  It will make the village project a by right development for planning commission approval. So if you want to see changes, now's the time between now and second reading. My view is this, Ann Arbor needs the housing and Robertson Brothers is a reputable builder. But this is a plan for 1993, not 2023. This developer is stuck in what economists refer to as status quo bias.  It does not grasp that the climate emergency dictates that we do everything differently, including construction. The village's for sale homes will be all electric, but the apartments, there will be 320 with more planned, will have gas heat. This directly conflicts with strategy two, action one of the 820 plan, which includes the following assumption, quote, all new residential and commercial buildings are designed and built to operate without the use of natural gas, end quote.  And strategy three, action two, quote, all new construction from 2022 to 2030 and beyond is built to net zero energy standards, which includes no natural gas consumption, end quote. Our Office of Sustainability and Innovations reviewed the village last July and wrote this, quote, the use of fossil fuels in any capacity goes against the goals of 820, end quote.  I calculate that the village's 320 apartments will produce 2,064 metric tons a year CO2 equivalent emissions just from burning gas. That almost cancels out the 2,446 metric tons a year that the city's Enerlogix solar at city facilities project will prevent. Gasoline savings from converting commuters to village residents will help, but will only offset about one fifth the damage.  We're told the apartments will be electrification ready, which means that they'll have a 220-volt panel for when it's time to replace the furnace. But gas furnaces have a 15- to 20-year lifetime. We can't wait that long for them to fail. And a heat pump for furnace swap often won't work because ducted systems are inefficient. The affordability versus sustainability narrative is a false one. Look at the apartment project at 1815 North Maple. It achieves both.  A Robertson Brothers consultant wrote that tenant utility bills would be 20% to 30% higher at the village with electric heat. But they used DTE's October 2021 gas rate of $0.67 per therm. That rate is now $0.89, or 33% higher, while electric rates are the same. The operating cost advantage for gas over high efficiency heat pumps is gone, at least for now. Tighter buildings with rooftop solar would ensure affordability.

Public comment making good progress miss dig and permit submitted working to expedite permit with city staff if all goes well We may be able to start work Wednesday or Thursday weather permitting this is regarding the mid-block crosswalk on  Fuller, that was a site of a fatality in 2016. I stood at this podium three or four times and begged the city to address the lack of lighting. The closest streetlight was 132 feet away. When the child was killed, the driver was not found at fault because a driver could not have reasonably seen the child in the crosswalk. I submitted a ticket on January 9th of this year after  The lights had been out for some time. Now we are getting to the point of contacting Mystic. I'm not going to go into all the details, but it is unconscionable for the city of Ann Arbor to not refer street lighting and illumination of crosswalks to the Transportation Commission. For some reason, it belongs to some other department somewhere that seems to be called Kathy Griswold.  We have to address this. So tonight I'm talking about DC one resolution to commence.  a collaborative planning process regarding the bridge. Obviously, we weren't collaborating and planning until certain people arrived on council. But anyway, given the projected cost increase of over $2 million, we need to look at this from a historical perspective and in the context of the greater need for pedestrian and cycling infrastructure in this community, especially crosswalk illumination.  So while we're working on tweaking this bridge one more time, we have hundreds of street lights that are out and hundreds, if not thousands, of crosswalks without optimal lighting, which is positive contrast lighting. So I've already talked about what's happened at Huron High School.  The DTE executive believes that it's two circuits that are connected to at least 35 lights. And these circuits, underground circuits, get damaged from all the development and digging and whatever we're doing. And so they may have to restring lighting. In conclusion, I was going to talk a lot more about the University of Michigan and how we're collaborating with them right now, but I'll save that  please light our crosswalks."}, {"start": 652, "end": 659, "speaker": "SPEAKER_20", "text": "Thank you.

On January 27, parts of the world celebrated International Holocaust Remembrance Day. Actually, that was just the official day of remembrance. The real Remembrance Day is every day of the year, and if you don't believe that, merely create for yourself a Google alert on the word Holocaust.  The reason for this daily reminding is to fix forever in people's minds the eternal suffering and innocence of the Jewish people. Tonight, I'd like to focus on this alleged Jewish innocence, the innocence that is programmed into our minds by Hollywood, the media, campus, statues, and museums throughout America. We are taught that National Socialists of Germany wished to exterminate the Jews for no other reason than that they were Jews.  We are taught that Jews did nothing to deserve this alleged extermination and were like innocent lambs being led to slaughter. But maybe in 1933, Jews were not as innocent as we were led to believe. The headline of the March 24th edition of London's Daily Express read, Judea declares war on Germany. Jews in all the world unite in action. From the body of the article,  The Jewish wholesaler will quit his house, the banker his stock exchange, the merchant his business, and the beggar his humble hut in order to join the holy war against Hitler's people. And this international call to boycott really was against the German people. Jewish elites knew that the boycott would cause the starvation, the deaths of 30% of Germany's population.  A Jewish newspaper called Nasha Resch wrote, the war against Germany will be waged by all Jewish communities, conferences, congresses, by every individual Jew. Thereby, the war against Germany will ideologically enliven and promote our interests, which require that Germany be wholly destroyed.  Samuel Untermyer, president of the World Jewish Economic Federation, spewed falsehoods in his hate-driven speeches designed to whip up support for this Jewish-led boycott. He said, Germany has been converted from a nation of culture into a veritable hell of cruel and savage beasts. But in fact,  This economic war by Jews against Germany in 1933 occurred long before there was any such thing as sanctions or reprisals of any kind against European Jews. Innocent or warlike, as the Ann Arbor News said today, the past rediscovered.

I wanted to make a couple of comments about a memo from the city administrator that is in our packet this evening. This is relating to the prevailing wage compliance checks that counsel just a little bit of background here. Of course, the city of Ann Arbor  Requires all contractors that we hire for public improvements projects to pay the local prevailing wage Which is essentially the local union wages for skilled craft and craft labor and in 2016 this Not this body, but City Council  passed a resolution asking the city administrator at the time to do cross checks with the contractor's certified payroll. And last year it was determined by staff to discontinue this practice because they had only found one  violation in five years. Now instead of doing that, this body took a different step. We decided to add the practice of periodic random spot checks on site where our city staff are interviewing people about their wages. They're doing wage rate interviews.  This is considered a best practice in the industry. And as this memo notes, in this past construction season, 24 violations were found. So we went from one violation in five years using the payroll records to 24 violations  in one season, which is really significant. I have additional questions. I think this merits some follow-up. I did ask the city administrator today for a couple of pieces of information, the list of contractors who had the violations. I'm particularly concerned about the ones who have unresolved violations at this point. And, you know, it's concerning that there were 17 contractors that didn't know the  correct wage rate. I don't know if that means they didn't know it was a prevailing wage job or what happened there, but we need to make sure they're getting the right information.  And I'd also further like to investigate what other municipalities do when contractors fail to comply, fail to remedy such issues, or repeat offenders. Do we levy fines? Do we consider disbarment from future bidding? Given the scope of the violations that were uncovered this year, I think we need to think about the consequences that we want to levy. And, you know, I just would  Summarized by saying I think that 24 is probably more indicative of what's been happening all along So I'm really pleased that council took that action last year And I think this shows that we need to be doing this indefinitely into the future councilmember Adina"}, {"start": 1771, "end": 1783, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "text": "Thank you, Mayor.

My house shares a south property line with 530 North Division Street. I'm opposed and protest the PUD. R4C zoning limits multifamily housing  to three units. Both properties, 530, 524, are zoned R4C. However, the only plan Mr. Selby submitted was a non-zone compliant four units, one more unit than R4C allows. When that failed to make it through the planning department, he applied in 2022 for a PUD with the stated purpose of removing the existing 300  3,333 square feet building, replacing it with an 8,000 square foot four-unit building. This timeline shows an attempt to usurp R4C rights of others. It's not allowed under the Unified Development Code. I think Mr. Selby was wasting the planning department's time, council's time, my time, my attorney's time, and will waste court time.  I see the 5.30 proposal as greed camouflaged by green. The property owner to the north is an attorney. He gets three feet of setback. I'm not an attorney, nor is my husband. We get none. Our seasonal storage bin that I've used for 40 years will be taken away. I am now made to share a driveway. I have no place to put the snow.  The perennials lining the driveway are going to be taken away. Our daughter helped plant those when she was six. If Mr. Selby had approached the project correctly the first time, we would not be here tonight. And if an 8,000 square foot building can prove net zero, then a building half the size with the same solar footprint can also be net zero without a zoning change. I request you, Mr. Taylor,  to approach Mr. Selby and request that he produce a building plan that fits R4C and ask Mr. Selby to stop wasting our time. Please stop the PUD.

I'm president of the Old Fourth Ward Association, where this project is sitting, will sit.  Over the past few years, Doug Selby has met with the executive committee of the Old Fourth Ward Association many times.  to outline his plans, which ultimately culminated in a PUD. He gave us endless reasons why the current building is not sustainable, that it's barely holding together, probably just because it's used to holding together.  and how something that is larger in scale could benefit both the neighborhood in terms of attractiveness and also add to more units of housing in the neighborhood.  Preservationists don't take kindly very often to these kinds of proposals, but we had many respectful discussions with Doug Selby, and we came to realize that his plan was a good one, a sound one. We all live in historic houses, and we love our historic houses and all the history of our community that they embody.  These two houses present an unusual case for us because they were two buildings that were just kind of band-aided together at some point in time. They were never a single house. And Doug Selby did extensive research to come to the conclusion that this would be probably the best solution in terms of making this particular building usable into the 21st century.  For that reason we supported the project before the Historic District Commission We also supported the project When it went to the Planning Commission and we support the project here before City Council  We've not always been happy about PUDs. We vigorously opposed what has ended up now as a hotel in the historic district on Glen Street. We were adamantly opposed to that. It wasn't housing. It's a vanity project.

I just wanted to say a couple words about this project, which we're calling The Bridge. From its inception, we wanted this project to be an example. We wanted it to be carbon neutral in operation, which is actually pretty tricky on such a small site.  Buildings also produce a lot of carbon in construction, though, so to a pretty great extent, we're deconstructing the building and reusing as many of the elements as we can. Also, we have a pretty extensive curated list almost entirely of recycled, non-toxic, or sustainably manufactured products. All of them are non-toxic. Can't really go through all the green features here tonight, or we'd be here for a few hours, but what I can say is that this project is a pretty impressive piece of engineering.  and it's legitimately one of the world's most sustainable buildings. We designed it to fit into the streetscape and scale, and design, make a nice piece of architecture. I appreciate the strong support of the Old Fourth Ward Association, and I appreciate the ideas that they came up with to make it better. We also want it to be an educational tour with tours and seminars on site, and videos that explain these advanced technologies, not just how they work, but also how they're installed.  We'll be working with the Skill Bridge Program, which retrains exiting armed forces member in construction, in the construction industry. We hope to work with the Ann Arbor Student Builder Program. These are high school kids who build houses as part of their curriculum. We desperately need this next generation of construction workers to be up to speed on this type of emerging construction technology.  And we want this to be a place for hands-on learning. Passive buildings can offer a better long-term return on investment for developers, and we want that to be out there so that people will be incentivized to do this more. We also wanted it to be repeatable and hopefully scalable so that more people will build deep energy buildings. I know this is just a tiny drop in the bucket, but it doesn't really amount to much unless we can use it as a springboard to make this type of construction much more commonplace.  It's hard to talk about our climate emergency as a scientist without sounding hysterical, but gosh darn it, I just feel like we need to start following our intent with meaningful actions. Buildings are a huge part of the problem, and we need to be incentivizing people to retrofit and rebuild all electric buildings that can become carbon neutral.  I know you can't make everybody happy all the time, but I'm sure you guys know that better than most, as well as the city staff. But I do see that we need to move forward in a way that creatively tackles these problems if we're going to tackle the biggest crisis that humankind has ever seen.

This is the same project, but we're talking about the site plan, not the rezoning. A few minutes ago, you heard me oppose fossil fuels in the village project. It's a real pleasure for me now to support 530 North Division without reservation. This is a rental that's built to passive house standards, and more importantly, to living building challenge standards. In other words,  It's a building that produces more energy than it consumes. All electric, of course, no gas, with extensive rooftop solar and battery storage, but with a very tight building envelope that breathes using ERV energy recovery ventilation. As Mr. Selby commented, it will employ recycled and ecologically friendly materials and will reuse as much original building material as possible. It employs modular construction.  And according to the site plan, excuse me, one more thing, it will keep and reuse all the stormwater on site. The site plan indicates that this will be one of the most sustainable buildings in the country, but not one of the most expensive. Mr. Selby has said in the past that he doesn't think a net zero building should increase the rental rates beyond market value.  By adding the rear addition, but keeping the same number of units, four, the rents will certainly go up along with the additional floor space, but the larger units will accommodate more people. And there will be much lower utility bills for tenants, given the tight building envelope and rooftop solar. Overall, this is a transformational plan for a building that, as Mr. Selby hopes, should be a model for rental housing, not just locally, but nationally."}, {"start": 3354, "end": 3364, "speaker": "SPEAKER_20", "text": "Thank you.

I just wanted to address another topic tonight, which is affordability. I'm a member of Equitable Ann Arbor, which has as a core value that if you work in Ann Arbor, you should be able to live in Ann Arbor.  These apartments are a market rate. I can't make them affordable and cover the cost of construction. And since starting and titling this project over five years ago, the cost of what it will take to make me be able to break even on this has risen about $600 per bedroom. It's a lot.  It kind of keeps me up at night, but the alternative is to keep throwing good money after bad with a building that is just pretty badly compromised. I think this council understands more than most that in order to keep our city vibrant and dynamic, that means we need a lot more housing, especially if we want to be inclusive with our housing. And if sustainability and affordability are problems the city wants to tackle, we have to address one of the root causes.  One of them is that it's way too difficult and costly to build in Ann Arbor. Outcomes can be very unpredictable. Ultimately, taxpayers pay for that, and it makes our city less affordable and less possible to meet our city's challenges and population growth.  And it also freezes out small local developers. High cost and unpredictability of entitlement can make it too risky. So I know it's really easy to complain about government and bureaucracies and things like that, but there is a lot of stuff the city could do to make this work better.  Just one small example is using the PUD designation to cut through a lot of the red tape and offer people an incentive if they will come up with exemplary projects that the city is looking for. Also, I think it would be a strong incentive for developers, and the city would get better developments faster, and you'd probably foster more trust between the city and the building and development community.  Post-pandemic, a lot of organizations are sort of reassessing their policies to see what's relevant still and what's a relic. And I am heartened to see that the city seems to be having these conversations now. We do have a long way to go, though. And I think we all have to change and adapt to the way we've historically done things if we want to meet this enormous challenge. And certainly, I can tell you the building industry is no exception to that.  So, but I want to leave this one thought is that I would say that a carrot is always a more powerful than the stick if we're bringing about long-lasting positive change. And I urge you to use this opportunity and time to work with us to create more win-win situations."}, {"start": 3526, "end": 3538, "speaker": "SPEAKER_20", "text": "Thank you.

And in some cases, it may be the stormwater professionals who don't want stormwater to be provided to the full extent.  ground water contamination or soil contamination under high ground water, or at the very end of a watershed where it could actually exacerbate flooding by introducing a detention base into that area. So this section, previously we were asking for money to be replaced to instead of the detention.  The change is actually very similar to something that's already a city policy. We have a Green Streets policy that has some of the same wording and the same process of allowing staff to make the decision to not provide full detention when site constraints don't make sense.

He spent a lot of time working on amending this ordinance with the attorney for Mishnah who oversees this at the state. It's there's a lot of very specific  language changes that for the most part is trying to make this consistent with state statute. But the reason we brought it forward now is two primary reasons. One was to allow projects that are targeting what's called income averaging. I know the city and myself, we promoted affordable housing for households at 60% of median income or less. There are  different programs including the low income housing tax credit program that has changed a couple years ago that allows a project to qualify for the tax credit program serving households up to 80% of median income as long as they are also serving households at lower income so that they have an average of 60% of median income and the intent is to provide an incentive  to have some of the lower rents set aside for lower income households. So that's one of the most significant changes. In order to do that, we needed to change the pilot ordinance. There's some other changes that are related to just clarifying language about what projects are eligible. And the other most significant change to the language, but it doesn't have really any impact on projects, is that we had two different types of  projects that were eligible. One was based on income and the other one was based on elderly undefined. And we realized in our research that all the projects that are currently eligible for elderly under this ordinance actually are also eligible at 60% of median income. However, the elderly tax exemption in the past, the projects paid 4% of  rents towards taxes and those that were eligible under the 60% of median income only paid $1 per unit per year. So we just made that consistent, removed the elderly component, which wasn't ever really part of the state statute. And so projects would all be eligible under the same $1 per unit per year. And just a note for those of you who are new to this ordinance, which I probably should have said right up front, but  Sorry about that. This allows for a tax exemption for qualified housing for affordable housing. And the qualified project, it's very specific. So it's not just because you're providing housing for households at 60% of AMI or less. You also have other thresholds you have to pass that's in the state statute. And so this allows all these projects to qualify under the $1 per unit per year  tax exemption. And I think if Chris has anything to add, I will allow him to do that."}, {"start": 4826, "end": 4830, "speaker": "SPEAKER_20", "text": "Thank you."}, {"start": 4830, "end": 4833, "speaker": "UNKNOWN", "text": "Jennifer, I don't have anything to add."}, {"start": 4833, "end": 4862, "speaker": "SPEAKER_20", "text": "But I will be able to answer questions if anybody has any.

Just want to remind you that the project replaces a blighted site with a biophilic building. All the tenants will be able to enjoy the outdoors from their unit.  and the grounds will feed pollinators that use the Huron River Flyway. The building will be net zero plus five percent, which means that it produces more energy than it consumes. It will have low-flow water faucets, and it's really important also to realize that this project is recycling the existing building into the new building.  which will be made with sustainable products. So there are so many boxes that this ticks in terms of our sustainability goals. And as Mr. Selby, who spoke earlier as the developer, remarked, it is meant to be an example of what can be done. And we need more of that. So I will be voting in support and I hope you will join me."}, {"start": 4929, "end": 4931, "speaker": "SPEAKER_20", "text": "Further discussion?

I'm really interested in the approach that the developer is taking to making this  at a cost savings and also his dedication to education because I think that doing this kind of project is really innovative. It requires a lot of learning and I think it is completely accurate to say that we need to have more carrots and things that we can, blueprints that we can transfer to other projects.

It's taken five years to get to us, and I'm not saying that that is all on, you know.  on our plate, but it is something that we certainly want to work to expedite these projects so that they can become even more affordable.

So really quickly, Living Building Challenge has seven performance categories. They consider it like petals on a flower. So place, water, energy, health and happiness, materials, equity and beauty. So these are a lot of factors that are contributing to  what can actually happen with this building that benefits our community. And I think it's really noteworthy to say that there are only 390 Living Building Challenge buildings right now that they're actually pursuing this designation. You have to prove that you've been energy efficient over time. So it's a process that takes time. But there are only 15 fully certified Living Building Challenge  recipients or designated facilities. And that's across the world. So this is a huge commitment to the environment and setting a real standard that if the developer's vision around creating the next generation of builders and tradespeople who understand how this works and using it as a model, that's, I think, something our community really wants to have here. And it's not easy. So this is not a project where  the builders or the developers taking the easy route, he's actually going the hardest possible route to achieve some of our 820 goals.

I mean, I think PUD is supposed to, is a designation for flexibility in land use and to encourage innovation in a timely manner. I hope our future discussions and future reviews can talk about that a little bit more, because if we're all in an agreement, then perhaps  This is where we talk a little bit more in the comprehensive plan and not force developers to go through a five-year route at cost. Just as we ourselves, as homeowners, are unlikely to sell at market or below market rate, the expectations for developers seems a bit high.
