That's really the only word I could think of to describe it. We're heartsick.  that this terrible thing could happen to someone that we all know and love. She was one of the original commissioners at the inception of the Independent Community Police Oversight Commission. And Jude had a tremendous impact on ICPOC. Her work will be guiding our work and our mission for a long time to come.  Just a few things that she did for us. First of all, she brought wisdom and experience that was needed to launch ICPAC. She led in the establishment of our budget. She formulated interview questions for candidates. She developed the training requirements for the commissioners. And she hosted many of our meetings and training  sessions. And I know you've probably read about her and you know what she meant to the community at large, but she meant these things to ICPAC. But you know, I spoke to some of the commissioners and other people that worked closely with Jude. The one thing that everyone said about her was how kind she was. Her kindness was evident to everyone who knew her.  and that kindness will be remembered. She was kind in her personal life, and she was kind in her professional life. We just don't understand how such a terrible thing could happen, but everyone who came in contact with Jude spoke of her kindness. Ralph Waldo Emerson said, you cannot do kindness too soon, for you never know  how soon it will be too late. And I think about that when we think about Jude. And I just want to suggest that perhaps as we move into our moment of silence, that in her honor and in her remembrance, we commit to being a little kinder to each other every day.

And in that light, it is my great pleasure to honor Arab-Americans here in our community through the Proclamation of National Arab-American Heritage Month.  And I'll just read a little bit here and there. Whereas for over a century, Arab Americans have been making valuable contributions to every aspect of American society in medicine, law, business, education, technology, military service, and culture. And whereas, upon immigration, they have brought with them to America resilient family values, strong work ethic, dedication to education, diversity in faith and creed that have added strength to our great democracy.  And whereas the history of Arab-Americans in the United States remains regrettably neglected and or defaced by misconceptions, bigotry, and anti-Arab hate in the forms of speech and crime. Whereas Arab-American issues such as civil rights, harmful stereotyping, and bullying must be combated in the form of education and awareness.  Whereas Arab-Americans join all Americans in the desire to see a peaceful and diverse society where every individual is treated equally and feel safe. And whereas the incredible contributions and heritage of Arab-Americans have helped us build a better nation, and I'd like to add, a better city. Now, therefore, I, Christopher Taylor, Mayor of Ann Arbor, Michigan, announce that Arab-American Foundation celebrates the contributions of Arab-Americans to our community and declare April 2023 to be Arab-American Heritage Month in the city of Ann Arbor.

Proclamation of the 54th Annual Professional Municipal Clerks Week.  The role of the city clerk, the county clerk, the municipal clerk, is perhaps not well known to folks outside of the halls of municipal government, but the clerks here and everywhere are absolutely fundamental to everything we do. They are central to the defense and propagation of the city.  That's probably a word somewhere in there, and I'm sure someone will find one. Propagation of democracy, both here in Ann Arbor, that's protection throughout our various communities. Here in Ann Arbor, we are incredibly grateful to have a city clerk and a clerk's office that does outstanding work, that promotes elections, that promotes voting, that enables everyone in our community who wishes to vote and is allowed to vote to be able to vote. And we are just, we're just so excited and proud about the work that is done here by staff. And so to meet to,  to declare this Proclamation Week. So I'll just read a little bit. Whereas the office of the professional municipal clerk is a time-honored and valued part of local government throughout the world, whereas the office of professional municipal clerk is among the oldest of public servants, and whereas the professional municipal clerks have pledged to be ever mindful of their neutrality and impartiality, rendering equal service to all.  Whereas professional municipal clerks continually strive to improve the administration and affairs of the Office of Clerk through participation in education programs, seminars, workshops, and annual meetings. Whereas it is therefore most appropriate that we recognize the accomplishments of the Office of Professional Municipal Clerk.  Now, therefore, I, Christopher Taylor, Mayor of Ann Arbor, do recognize the week of April 30 through May 6, 2023 as Professional Municipal Clerks Week and further extend appreciation of our profession. You see, I just always want to say participation whenever I'm thinking of Clerk Boudry.

And one of its core values is the protection of the rights to collectively bargain and the right of workers to come together to even the playing field between the employer, the manager, and the workers.  drive for workers to unionize, of course, has began many decades ago and is not yet finished with respect to its advances for workers, their rights, their job performance, their ability to enjoy the fruits of their labor.  One, of course, one often thinks of wages and other working conditions and benefits when it comes to the benefits of organized labor. But worker safety is among the core benefits. And the promotion of worker safety is among the core benefits of an organized workforce. I'm so delighted that Council Member Ayer has brought this week to my attention, along with members of organized labor. And I am just delighted that we are able here to recognize the work that  that is ongoing to continue to promote worker safety in the United States. Whereas every year, April 28, communities and work sites around the world honor friends, family members, and colleagues who have been killed or injured on the job. Whereas in 2021, the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics estimated that 5,190 workers were killed by traumatic injuries on the job, an average of nearly 100 workers every week.  Whereas in 2021, 140 workers were lost through fatal workplace accidents here in Michigan. And whereas it is appropriate to honor the memory of the courageous and dedicated members of Ann Arbor's labor force who have been injured or disabled or have died as a result of workplace accidents. Whereas the city of Ann Arbor wishes to pay tribute to these workers who have died, been injured or disabled, and we honor the contributions of Michigan's workforce and call for increased worker safety.  Whereas the City of Ann Arbor renews our efforts to seek stronger workplace safety and health protections, better standards and enforcement, and fair and just compensation by rededicating ourselves to improving the safety and health of every city workplace. Now, therefore, I, Christopher Taylor, Mayor of Ann Arbor, do hereby proclaim April 28, 2023 to be Workers Memorial Day in the City of Ann Arbor and urge all citizens to recognize and honor the contributions of Michigan's workforce and to call for increased workplace safety."}, {"start": 1183.743, "end": 1259.063, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "text": "Thank you Mr. Mayor and thank you to Council for recognizing this very important day.

Mayor, members of council, it's my pleasure to stand before you this evening to present the city administrator's proposed budget for fiscal year 24 and 25.  Each year, we have to be intentional about what we're trying to accomplish with the budget. For this year, that is positioning for long term impact. The budget's purpose is not only to clarify how we propose to invest the public dollars that we are entrusted to manage.  But it is also necessary for us to be transparent about the direction that we believe we should take. I'm going to do a presentation for you this evening that touches on both things. Some notion of how we propose to invest public dollars, but also to talk about directions that we believe we should take.  You have your budget books. You have my detailed budget message. Therefore, I will not stand here and read numbers back to you. I'll use numbers here and there just for context purposes. But the full details of all the budget is there before you. So we are presenting a proposed budget, all funds of $563 million, $666,000.  The general fund, which is the bread and butter that makes up the services that many of our residents come to expect, is just shy of $130 million. The general fund has experienced 6.4% growth. State shared revenue is essentially flat at 1%. And our pension system is still among the gold standard in the United States.  If you understand pension systems within that industry, if you are 70% funded, that is considered very good. For us to be at 90% is extraordinary. And so we're positive about having that. At the same time, we see pressure melting. From a fiscal standpoint, we are charged with being conservative.  So when we look at the fact that the economists are still forecasting a potential recession in the calendar year, when we look at the fact that state shared revenue is flat, that our marijuana excise tax receipts have essentially leveled off when we thought they would continue to rise.  even though we have solid growth in the general fund, those other factors are there and it's our responsibility to take note of it with you. It's not about doomsday, it's not about the sky is falling, we're not here saying the world is going to end, but we are alerting you that we see conditions in the future, that we see conditions in the future worth noting.  Within two to four years, our recurring expenses will eclipse our recurring revenues. We need to pay attention to that. We pivot now to celebrating Ann Arbor. What you see on the screen is the logo that has been designed to recognize our bicentennial.  As you know, I'm one of the people leading the community wide effort to prepare for the celebration for next year. Dr. Missy Stoltz is heading up the internal city government preparation for the bicentennial celebration. Our plan is to celebrate across 12 full months, not one month, not one week, not one day, but all 12 months. One of the things that we are proposing to do  is to invest $200,000 in this year and next year's fiscal year budget in order to support the efforts of the Bicentennial activities. It would help to cover the activities that city government is doing, such as a planned salute for former Olympians who are from Ann Arbor, an idea that was presented to us by an Olympian.  Also would allow us to partner with Destination Ann Arbor to procure a photographer and a videographer who would capture the essence of what happens across the 12 months. This is a milestone within the city's history. We should capture it and we need to preserve what we do for going forward.  In addition to the $200,000 per year that we're proposing to allocate, there will also be additional leveraging that takes place through what we call co-branding. Co-branding are activities that you were already going to do. But in 2024, you will simply do it under a bicentennial banner.  And so by leveraging activities that we already have planned, that will add another several hundred thousand dollars to the city's investment in Bicentennial. We are also encouraging other organizations across the city to do likewise. As an example, this coming summer, the Art Fair is planning on beginning to co-brand their activity.  so that their artists will have a year's notice that next year is the Bicentennial, which might influence some of the products, some of the artwork that they bring here to sell. One of the legacy projects that we would like to do is to create Bicentennial Park. We propose to take what is currently Fuller Park  rename it to Bicentennial Park, and place a number of new amenities within the park. This will not be accomplished in a single year. It will require investments from city government, but there are also opportunities for sponsorships in order to make this vision come to reality. Fuller Park, by the way,  is not dedicated to an individual, so we're not taking a name away from someone. Fuller Street is dedicated to an individual, but Fuller Park is not. So the legacy project would include, I guess we gotta go back to glasses. We wanna do a universal access splash pad.  Geothermal systems to make the park carbon neutral. We propose to do a sculpture to former Olympians. We want to do a sculpture garden to pay tribute to indigenous land holders. We'd like to see sensory trails put in the park given the proximity to Children's Hospital. We'd like to erect a shelter building for parks programming. And we'd also like to add community garden plots.  again, can't happen in a single year, would require investments from city government, but also sponsorship opportunities for organizations that may want to put their name on something that we're doing. Still within the focus of celebrating Ann Arbor is our sister city of T\u00fcbingen, Germany. This summer we will be sending a delegation there to visit. They will host our delegation over several days.  The pictures that you see on the screen are from Tubagen. They are proposing to send a delegation here next year for six days. And we're allocating $30,000 in order to cover the activities of the delegation while they're here. They are trying to plan their trip to coincide with some of the events and activities that are taking place in  in honor of the celebration. So sometime during the summer months we probably will be entertaining their visit. We next pivot into supporting democracy. If you think back to the last election there were two narratives at play. The long lines that were experienced in Ann Arbor and across the country  And the second narrative around voter integrity, the protection of the ballots, the protection of the count. In order to address this, we are proposing to establish an election center. An election center will be an actual physical location. The election center will be managed by the office of the clerk.  It would give them space to process ballots. It would give them space to secure ballots. It would give them the opportunity to do all the things associated with ensuring we have a fair and proper election. Because our situation is one where we have to try to be efficient at all times, we want to be opportunistic around the opportunity that setting up the election center would give us.  Therefore, we are also proposing to co-locate CTN as part of the election center physical footprint. Today, CTN is in a leased space. We are proposing to move it into a city-owned facility. We're also proposing to create the city's first emergency operations center.  Historically when we've needed to have an ELC, graciously the University of Michigan has allowed us to use their facility. But we are a large enough city where we should have our own facility. If you think just about this current calendar year, there were three occurrences where we would have activated an ELC if we had one.  the visit by the Vice President, the ice storm, and the subsequent snowstorm. All of those would have merited the kind of attention that the ELC would bring. We would intend to pursue state and federal funding to equip and set up the ELC, not to use general fund dollars if at all possible. In order to establish  The election center, this will be a real estate transaction, very likely to be seven figures. In addition, it would cost us some 300,000 plus annually to operate the facility. So the image that you see on the screen is generic, because we don't yet have a facility to put a transaction in front of you. We are working on that.  And to address the long lines that we experienced on election day, the office of the clerk is proposing to have nine days of early voting. The clerk's office is working in partnership with the University of Michigan and others to set that up.  And one of the challenges that Ms. Boudreaux will face is how to convince young people to actually vote early instead of waiting to party in the line on election day. So good luck with that, Jackie. But we do want to do this to try to address the experience that we've had. We then pivot into sustainability.  July 1 will mark the beginning of our collection of the Community Climate Action Millage. $7 million is what we propose to collect.  and the staff under Dr. Stoltz's leadership will be working on expanding solar distribution, further weatherization of houses and neighborhoods, the expansion of EV charging stations around the community, continuing to study geothermal. She proposes, and what's in the budget,  is to add seven positions that will be funded by the millage in order to carry out this work. We then pivot into the neighborhoods. This is the first season when the road bond initiative is actually in full swing.  So the local streets you see on the screen, Olivia, Norfolk, Tudor, Winstead, Dunmore and more will be covered under this year's iteration of the road bond program. Additionally, we have major streets resurfacing that will also be covered by the bonds.  South State, South Main, Geddes, Earhart, Research Park Drive are all examples of major streets that will be resurfaced under this program. We acknowledge that as a community, we are going to go through major inconvenience. You cannot do accelerated street paving at the rate we are proposing to do it without inconvenience.  But our mindset is progressing through the inconvenience because on the back end, we will have a much better community. In addition to the two slides I've shown you, we also have local resurfacing that will happen. This does not use road bond funds, and that includes Aberdeen, Belfield, Avon Road, and Bedford Road.  Paving, paving, paving, a lot of that going on. But that is what we promised and that's what we hope to deliver. For the past several years, our community has struggled with stormwater management issues around the city. The picture at the top of the screen is a local picture of what people experience that deal with stormwater management.  This budget invests $250,000 to conduct drainage studies. Drainage studies across 13 miles to allow us to get a better handle on the cause and potential solutions for people who have been experiencing this situation. We owe it to the community to find a way to resolve this issue.  And these studies will enable us to do that. In addition, we are undertaking a solid waste program review. So, sort of rhetorically, what does better look like?  So when you look at waste collection and recycling, commercial composting, oversized materials collection, we are trying to find a way to deliver our service in a better way. We are trying to be a factor in helping our city to become cleaner. This is also an issue that has been raised relative to downtown Ann Arbor.  It is not solely the city's role to address this, but we do have a part to play. And by looking at our program service delivery to find better ways to do it, we hope to be a significant factor in showing the improvement. And now we turn to issues of public interest. First out of the gate is the Treeline Trail.  The Treeline is a long-term project. By all accounts, it will take more than a decade to actually build it out should we have that success. We are continuing our relationship with the Treeline Conservancy. We have placed an investment in the budget to hire consultative help to work with the Conservancy on the project.  However, the project has not yet matured to a point where it would warrant hiring a full-time FTE that would work all day every day on nothing but treeline. When the project gets to that point, I would be supportive of the FTE, but it's not yet ripe.  Our staff is working with the Treeline Conservancy's own lobbyist and our lobbying firm to pursue state and federal resources to advance the project. Still on issues of public interest, the unarmed response.  Last year when the budget was passed and subsequent to that, City Council appropriated $3.5 million in ARPA funding to provide the seed money necessary to get the program set up. In last year's budget, we set aside out of the marijuana excise tax $250,000 to support the initial investment.  In this budget, we're proposing to take 250,000 this year and next year to continue to provide the necessary cushion for that program to have a very solid beginning and operating. We need to actually see 12 full months of the program working to determine what it actually costs to do a single year.  And once I see how much it costs to do a year, then that would inform whether we bump that number up or look for another source. There's probably grant dollars out there that we can also pursue. And since we are aggressive about grants in Ann Arbor, it is something we would certainly look at. Which then brings us to 121 East Catherine Street. Still within the focus of issues of public interest.  On the screen, you see the rendering supplied by the Housing Commission. This is a Housing Commission project. But it's much more than just a building. 121 East Catherine is in an area of the city that historically was predominantly African American. And the vision for this project, aside from the 63 apartment units,  was to take 2,300 square feet of space on the first floor and turn it into a cultural and entrepreneurial center aimed at reclaiming our history. The only problem is there was no money to build out the space. So this budget takes $325,000 from the marijuana excise tax,  to design and build out the space, an additional 150 for capacity building for the neighborhood-based organization that is needed to influence and inform what happens there. It would be not in our best interest to construct a building, have 2,300 square feet of space on the ground floor, say it is there,  to connect with the people whose neighborhood it once was and have it be empty. So we want to address that as part of the construction. Finally, under issues of public interest, we need to have a solid workforce. Our workforce is too thin.  We have just north of 800 people. The needs and demands for service from the staff continues to grow. We have had a situation where several of our classifications are simply not market competitive.  Good employees have left here and gone to work for other municipal organizations because of money. There have been good candidates that we have tried to hire who have chosen not to come here because the salary is not competitive. We are investing $150,000 in this budget to conduct a compensation study. Our approach  in the past has been, I tend to just call it a series of one-offs. We find a problem over here and we go and try and fix it. We find an equity problem over there and we go and try and fix it. We need to have a global understanding of where are the specific positions that are not market competitive and what will it take to fix them.  Then we can devise a strategy that actually moves the needle. And that is what we are proposing to do with the 150 investment. This budget is adding 27 positions total. Those are detailed in your budget dictionary. But the majority of them are not gonna be funded out of the general fund.  Seven coming out of the millage. There are nine positions for the housing commission. HR is getting a deputy director. There's a few sprinkled here and there. And then we pivot to improving the customer experience, which is broader than just customer service. I've talked to you before about our need to elevate our customer service across the organization.  We have great examples of customer service every single day within the organization. Our issue is that we are not always consistent in how that service delivery happens. This budget invests $50,000 to help us get a consultant to develop customer service standards, develop training that we can use for staff to help us be a better organization across the board.  That's one element of the customer experience. The customer experience also includes the 15th District Court. They have a courtroom recording system that is clearly on the way out. I had a conversation with the chief judge. She told me that the company that they bought the system from no longer exists.  When they need to get parts to try to repair the system, they literally have to go on eBay to try to find them. That's why I put that on the screen. We can do better. So this budget invests $260,000 to replace that system.  The significance of the courtroom recording system, they have a requirement to produce transcripts from every single court proceeding. If the recording system fails, they can't do that. It's not a position that we can afford to be in. And then that brings us to supportive connections. A program that you created with the last budget.  One of the overarching goals of the program is to help people stay out of the judicial system. Yet we ask them to come into the Justice Center in order to access the services for a provision that we're trying to keep them out of. And if you look at the picture on the right, you see that the experience that someone has going into the office  where they may be needing to impart very sensitive personal information is really not conducive. Between the boxes and the cramped space, it's simply not up to par. So with this budget, we are proposing to take a portion of the one-time opioid settlement money, do a construction project,  in the former Tasty Green restaurant space and moved supportive connections from the fourth floor of the Justice Center into the first floor of City Hall. I wasn't around for Tasty Green. I heard it wasn't, well, we'll keep moving."}, {"start": 2933.699, "end": 2937.881, "speaker": "SPEAKER_25", "text": "We'll keep moving."}, {"start": 2937.881, "end": 3025.597, "speaker": "SPEAKER_33", "text": "And then that brings us to Council Chambers. The technology in this room is dated.  We are proposing an overhaul of council chambers. We need to upgrade the technology, which includes the microphones, this podium setup, the placement of monitors, the size of the monitors, all of that needs to be upgraded. The lighting, we want to put a mural in the ceiling. We want to have a standardization of the dais, things today we do not have.  It is part of the customer experience. And when you think back to where I started, this budget is intentional about positioning for long-term impact. This is a long-term decision that we are proposing to do now. Which then brings us to the downtown commitment. This has been something I've been championing my entire time here.  We've been engaging with stakeholders. We've been listening. We've been working with them. The number one thing that they said through our sessions and through surveys is we need to address the issue of public restrooms. And so I formed a public restroom work group"}, {"start": 3029.556, "end": 3035.525, "speaker": "SPEAKER_32", "text": "I gotta say, Mr. Barrett, when I told my granddaughter I was doing that, she thought I was kidding."}, {"start": 3035.525, "end": 3621.293, "speaker": "SPEAKER_33", "text": "Gran, what kind of job do you really have? So we've had people from various city departments, DDA, Destination Ann Arbor,  We've been meeting for months. We've been talking with elected officials. We've been talking with appointed officials. We've been studying restroom models. We've been looking at restrooms across the United States. We've been looking at restrooms overseas. Our one mandate is that any restroom that goes in downtown Ann Arbor must be ADA accessible. And so as a result of that work,  we have settled on the throne as the model that most fits Ann Arbor. It wouldn't look like what you see in the screen because you can change the exterior skin, but we found a company out of DC that has created an all ADA accessible model. We want to use the $200,000 that's already been allocated from ARPA  to do a pilot to make sure that the unit does what they say it will do. In doing this project, you've got to look at the infrastructure needs, you've got to look at the amount of space you need on your right of way, access to electricity, the cleaning function, the whole nine yards.  As we got deeper into the project, we found that there are other institutions or organizations within the city that also have that need. AAATA as an example. Where do bus drivers go when they need to stop? Because a lot of the private sector businesses do not want people to use their restrooms unless they're actually patrons. So the DDA is gonna be leading a placement analysis to help figure out where these should go.  More to come, the throne, who knew? Still within the downtown commitment, there has been concern expressed about safety. And this is an area where I'm talking to you about direction rather than dollars that I'm proposing to allocate right now. Last holiday season,  We put a walking unit in downtown and in Briarwood to go and engage with business owners, to engage with patrons, to engage with anyone that they saw. In Ann Arbor, we need to use a balanced solution, which means not a police-only solution. The direction that I would like to go in  is to establish a walking unit that would have fire EMTs, supportive connections person, and members of AAPD. They would walk together. They would walk together to build relationships, to address issues, to provide resource information for those who need it, to address people who may be having some minor  health or injury related situation. It will take us some time to get there because we don't have a full complement within the police department. The fire department will need to add two positions in order to do this and we need to figure out the capacity of supportive connections to be able to do it. But we're being completely transparent about the direction that we want to take.  That then brings us back to the solid waste study that we want to do, because there is a definite link between clean and safe. And so if we can help get downtown cleaner, we can help with the presence of the walking unit. We can provide public restrooms. Now we are talking about solutions that mean something and bring results. Won't get there overnight, but this is the direction that we want to head.  Which brings me to a case for revenue and the final section for me to present to you. From the graph, you see that we have more needs and resources. We are not unlike any other city. Our concern is what can Ann Arbor do about it? We have needs for housing at all levels. We have deferred maintenance.  that we've been putting off, and the longer you defer it, the more expensive it gets. And we have capacity issues within the staff. We need revenue. If state shared revenue is flat, if the marijuana excise tax receipts have leveled off, the growth in the general fund is simply not sufficient to address everything that we need.  I'll say this clearly. I am not talking about a tax hike. I'll say it again. I am not talking about a tax hike. I am talking about being more strategic with the assets that we have. Here are two examples. I would like to pursue  the building of a market rate development on the promenade that you're looking at. A market rate development would generate revenue back to the city. We could put a development there and walk our own talk. It could be all electric. It could be a model  for the kind of development we are challenging the community to come up with. You would simply capture the revenue from that development and then reimagine City Hall. We are never going back to a time when this building is full.  If we tried, employees would just quit. People aren't going to work where they have to show up every day if they have a choice. And we want our organization to be the employer of choice. So by capturing the revenue from that development and reimagining this building, who knows where that could lead us. I also  want to pursue taking what we call the Klein lot, which was assessed at $19 million some years ago, and I would like to see us pursue putting a market rate development on it. Because then you could capture the revenue that spins off from the development  Use it for deferred maintenance for staff support For service delivery that the public is demanding that we give them that we struggle to do now admittedly The use of the Klein lot for market rate versus affordable May get me uninvited to a Thanksgiving dinner table but  The spot that we are in, we simply, in my professional opinion, which is what you want me to give you, we cannot afford to take all of our assets and do all these development deals with private sector and others where the city gets no money. The developers need something. They want something. And if we're deferring all of our return for 30 years, but we're cash poor now,  The way I was trained, that does not work. Things to think about, nothing for you to vote on, just direction. My surprise for the evening, there's $1 million in marijuana excise tax that I did not allocate. It's in the fund balance for your consideration. As your advisor, you don't have to spend it all.  But I do have an obligation to tell you that I left it. Positioning for long term impact. I want to thank the finance department, the staff in the city administrator's office, the men and women who comprise the service areas of the organization. And I want to thank you for giving me the opportunity to serve as your city administrator. And on May 15th when you vote,  You don't really have to change a thing, just vote yes.

My first topic is CA-13.  which would authorize paying the Bodmin Law Firm another $150,000 to pursue litigation against Gelman. Since 2016, Bodmin has been paid $900,000 to fight Gelman, and in-house lawyers have spent countless hours. That has accomplished virtually nothing. And pursuit of state litigation also unfortunately resulted in delaying asking for EPA intervention by almost five years. Approving more fees is throwing good money after bad.  State law currently has no teeth. Further, pages 8 to 11 of the 2006 settlement agreement between the city and Gilman, negotiated by Bodmin, bars many types of claims that we might have, and they might be time-barred, too. You should be getting a second opinion. It's not appropriate to have Bodmin be the only one, since they'll benefit from going forward by getting paid, even if they lose.  And they did a bad job of telling you in the public about the infamous fourth CJ and the subsequent corporate process. Do you have a detailed memo explaining why these claims aren't barred? The agenda description does say part of the litigation will be enforcing the 2006 settlement agreement, that same agreement I just talked about. That's allowed under that agreement. Why couldn't that be done mainly in-house with minimal supervision from Bodmin? It seems a relatively discreet contractual matter rather than a complex environmental case.  Overall, this is a terrible waste of money, which Mr. DeHoney just said we need pretty bad. Next topic is the AC1 memo for a food truck at the comments. There are several positions in it which omit important facts or misleading or just wrong. Many of these are detailed in Julie Ritter's email to you yesterday, all of which I agree with. I'll focus on just a couple. The memo emphasizes the loss of parking revenue.  However, it seems that there isn't any lost revenue if there would be empty spaces in the underground lots during food truck events, and there typically are. Next, why couldn't the food trucks be charged the same amount for the space they take up? Next, under a 2019 resolution, parking revenue was actually supposed to be used to financially support the commons. That's been ignored, and the use of phantom loss of revenue as a reason not to allow activity on the commons is insulting, really, particularly when the 2018 Charter Amendment approved  was supposed to make this a commons. Obviously, that charter amendment is inconsistent with having cars park there permanently. This strange implicit argument in the memo would block any use other than parking. Finally, the statement that you need to get a detailed legal opinion rate commercial activity is not an indicator of the author's bias against the commons. Really, we've never had vendors allowed to get a permit on city property to sell things? Don't we have a street art fair?  My band is scheduled to play at the Commons this Saturday. Does that violate the charter? Should I worry about putting out a tip jar? It's facetious, partially, but really, do you think that the Prop A proponents, who by and large are the same people who want food trucks, are going to sue the city? This memo looks like it's the latest attempt to stall, stymie, and any activity and kill the Commons. It's shameful.

I want to address several topics tonight, but before that, I'd just like to thank Administrator DeHoney for his fantastic budget presentation. First, I want to make a quick note on the comprehensive plan CA-14, if I remember correctly.  I'm glad to see progress happening on this. Given how many of the PUD requests we see in the Planning Commission recently have been for things that, frankly, should be allowed in the zoning already, the comprehensive plan should make a clear call for liberalizing our zoning so that we don't have all of this unnecessary process and require things to be PUDs. Let's fix that.  Right now, a lot of Ann Arbor landmarks would just be illegal to build. So we should change that so that we can build the next generation of landmarks. Second, about the Dioxin, it's clear to even the lay observer that the company who purchased Gelman Sciences is using every bit of procedural trickery available to distance themselves from this mess. So this is ludicrous.  So far, the city has taken only tentative and timid actions about this. But given that the health of everyone in the city is on the line here, it's time to be bold. Finally, the memorandum to council about food trucks at the library department. In short, it was flawed reading this. If I understand correctly, the Council of the Commons contains several members who were involved in the drafting of Proposal A.  Yet the first meaningful attempt that they've made to activate the space is legally questionable under the language of that very proposal. Add to this the fact that it comes over four years after Proposal A was voted on, and the whole center of the city claims starts to look like, honestly, a bit of a damp squib.  So I went back and watched a few Council of the Commons meetings, and I must say the experience has left me baffled as to how we have continued this for so long. What a brooding, nagging squandering of the city's limited resources. At a recent meeting, the two council liaisons rightly  who removed themselves from the call in protest of a massive breach of rules of order designed to prevent a single commissioner from monopolizing the commission's time. Unfortunately, that appears to have been the only consequence for this commission, despite numerous other breaches of civility and etiquette. So maybe it's time to rethink proposal A altogether.

The Council of Commons was created in 2020 to advise this body and help plan the creation of a public park on the library lot. What it's become is a dysfunctional, deeply divided body that's neither advising you nor effectively advancing that project.  The latest example of this is on your agenda tonight. That's a nine-page memo prepared by the city administrator, requested by the Council of the Commons on the viability of permitting food trucks on the library lot. Asking city staff to analyze whether food trucks are viable on the site is, to be clear, a desperation play.  It's the best option among bad options to activate a site that everyone understands to be undesirable. This is something they proposed back in 2021, and to quote one member, they just needed a win. The logic of using food trucks to draw people to gather on an unimproved parking lot has it exactly backwards, and there are a lot of reasons for that.  But it also won't work. A 10-year-old Parks Advisory Commission report explained to us, again, 10 years ago, why. The site doesn't have foot traffic. It's boxed in on three sides. And it needs infrastructure to function properly as a public space. Council Member Briggs, you will recall asking the library director at the Council of the Commons meeting in December about food trucks and activating that site with that activity. And he responded that they've had food trucks on that site.  And they're not profitable. So this isn't a hypothetical. We've tested this. The libraries put food trucks out there. They've had to subsidize that activity. And that's the conclusion reached by the administrator. But the dysfunction of this body goes deeper than that. The last Council of the Commons meeting, the members were discussing a draft design RFP that isn't ready to issue despite two solid years of planning. It's badly overdue. It hasn't been socialized with city park staff. And it was attacked most of the meeting by a member of the council.  who spent an eight-plus-minute diatribe attacking it that survived inexplicably multiple points of order by other members. This council has outlived its utility to the public, and unless it's given a deadline to wrap its work up, it's going to continue to flounder. It's going to bicker about the terms of this RFP that it's never going to issue, and then it's going to attempt to justify its own existence by making work for city staff.  pass a resolution suspending the work of this body effective June 1. Give them a month of runway to wrap up their work. Then let staff and council members who have been supporting this activity patiently focus more of their time on actually meeting pressing resident needs.

This is Tom Stolberg calling from Lower Town in Ann Arbor. I'm calling about CA-14, the resolution to authorize a professional services agreement with Interface Studio LLC for comprehensive plant services. I am looking forward to this process, as I'm sure many of you are, and as many people in the community are.  I speak from the perspective of someone who has been a real estate professional for over 30 years, including as a developer, and who is looking to the Comprehensive Plan and subsequent zoning changes for guidance on future development of properties that I, my investors, and my clients own. I participated in some previous Comprehensive Plan revision processes, such as the Northeast Area Plan, P2D2, and the Lowtown Comprehensive Plan, as well as observing Comprehensive Plan revisions that impacted properties that I developed in other communities.  I've written and spoken many times to city council regarding comprehensive plan issues and other zoning matters. It is my hope that through this process that we are about to embark on, that the public, city council and planning commission will all gain better understanding of how planning and zoning is supposed to work. We haven't done a great job over the past several years. This is not just my opinion, but the observation of multiple experts.  Our city council members and commissioners haven't received the training and professional guidance that they, and we as their constituents, deserve. This has led to a number of votes based on narratives and speeches rather than on the criteria laid out in our law. An attorney recently asked me what I want to see from our city. My response was that I wanted honesty, intellectual honesty, adherence to proper processes, respect for the law, both the letter and the intent of the law.  We have fallen short of a number of times over the past several years. We seem to prefer our narratives to establish processes, to adherence to the Michigan Zoning and Aging Act, and to adherence to our unified development code. Perhaps this extensive revision of the comprehensive plan will better educate us on how it should be done. I'd also like to mention a good article in the most recent observer regarding development issues and also PUDs.  Later tonight, I will speak regarding an application for a PUD that contains multiple misrepresentations, that doesn't comply with multiple federal and city policies, and that clearly violates the intent of the law, and that likely violates the letter of the law. Are PUDs good or bad or just a tool? It was several years ago that some planning commissioners and city council members and their supporters narrated was that PUDs weren't viable.  That narrative is tied to the inappropriate loss of $9 million in affordable housing funds and monetized lower town development, and a similar failed attempt at upzoning while avoiding obligatory affordable housing funds down the block from there occurring. I sincerely hope that the comprehensive plan revision process is a successful, eye-opening, and clarifying experience for us all.  process matters. I look forward to this comprehensive plan revision.

Last October, I addressed council about the Ann Arbor School's compliance with Public Act 170, which mandates teaching of the Holocaust.  Since then, the school board was kind enough to provide me the requested information. I addressed the board last week and hoped that we were molding Ann Arbor students to become independent thinkers. I addressed council tonight with the same concern. The textbook used in our schools is World History Patterns of Interaction.  In the section on the Holocaust, our student first reads, the Nazis proclaimed that the Germanic peoples were a, quote, master race, end quote. I think we're all accustomed to that phrase. But I note that there's no attribution to that quote, no reference. Which Nazi leader said those words? There's no way for the student to know.  If the student were equipped with books that challenged that claim, such as Benton Bradbury's The Myth of German Villainy, he could read that no Nazi ever said those words. And if the student were encouraged to do so, he could download a copy of Mein Kampf by Adolf Hitler and could scan for Master Race. He won't find it, and he may be puzzled by the claim.  He may even conclude that master race was merely wartime propaganda in which all sides took part. On the same page, our student reads that the beginning of the Holocaust targeted Jews due to German failures. Some Germans even blamed Jews for their country's defeat in World War I, as if nothing could be further from the truth. But Alice and Weir's book, Against Our Better Judgment,  documents clearly that during that war, when Germany was about to defeat Britain, and had actually offered a negotiated peace, Zionist Jews engaged in the process of getting the U.S. into the war on Britain's side.  Prominent American Jews like Louis Brandeis and Felix Frankfurter worked behind the scenes to accomplish this task and were in fact successful at getting the Americans into the war, which ensured Germany's defeat. So what is ridiculed in the text our student reads is actually the true historic accounting of events.  I encourage the board, as I do counsel tonight, to provide our student with enough information to make up his mind independently and critically about historical events, and that he be provided with an array of viewpoints, not just one.

I appreciate this opportunity to speak before you tonight to talk about the center of the city. It's now approaching five years since Proposal A was passed and the sad truth is that we have very little to show for it. The request for proposals is still being worked on. The space has still not been activated in any meaningful sense.  City staff's analysis of what it would take to activate the space with food trucks and mobile vendors is damning, and the director of the Ann Arbor District Library has been very clear about the inherent challenges of using that space for library events. If and when the results of the RFP come in, any project approaching the drawing shared by Proposal A supporters will come at a cost of millions, or more likely tens of millions of dollars, and there is no source for that funding.  The ballot proposal included no funding component, and when Proposal A was on the ballot, the key supporters and organizers of the initiative assured us that city taxpayer money would not be required and that private money would flow in. Yet, it's taken us five years to finally put together the comparatively little funding just for the RFP.  I am therefore asking City Council members to take a hard and honest look at where the project currently stands in contrast to what the public was led to believe and the opportunity costs of allowing this process to continue. The people of Ann Arbor deserve better.  It's painful to think of what might have been. We could have had much needed housing. We could have had one or two floors of retail behind the plaza to create traffic flowing through it, making the space a space where people feel safe and relaxed.  In other words, we could have activated that space. We could have had a public closet that was privately maintained, and our city could have had revenue from the 100-year lease, from new property taxes, and from running a portion of the parking structure beneath. And our city's kids might have even had a seasonal splash pad and outdoor ice skating.  Please, take that hard and honest look and act boldly and realistically and find a new path beyond Proposal A to reinvent and activate this space.

I'm the president of Ann Arbor for Public Power, and I live at 1012 West Cross. I'm here today to ask for one small addition to the budget that was just proposed by City Administrator DeHoney. Very much appreciate your excellent presentation on that.  The council may remember that back in January of 2022, the council approved a feasibility study into municipalization as well as some other energy options. That study was funded in September of 22, and it's going to be finishing here in about June of this year. We do not know the results of that study yet. However, if that study is positive, the next step would be to get a valuation of DTE's assets.  Ann Arbor for Public Power is suggesting that we reserve some amount of money in the budget to pay for that study should we decide to do it. We originally proposed $500,000 for that study. However, after talking to other communities that have done this study, they believe that it'd be considerably cheaper than that. So we're amending our proposal to $250,000 reserved to get a hard valuation of the assets.  What that valuation will do is it will help with the city's legal proceedings to be able to go to DTE with a good offer for the price of their assets should we decide to go through with the acquisition process. Mayor Taylor actually just gave an excellent interview where he outlined the process for moving forward with municipalization on state side. I'd definitely recommend all of you go and listen to that.

My name is Sarah Ellen Strongman. I moved to Ann Arbor in 2018. I've been a resident in Ward four since I moved here.  And I'm here today to talk about the so-called center of the city. The election where Prop A appeared on the ballot was the first election in Michigan that I was eligible to participate in. My parents raised me to be an active citizen, and I registered to vote as soon as I moved here and was eligible. I read all about, you know, the various elections happening. I read up about Prop A.  And I remember thinking, well, this is silly. It's obviously not going to pass. In particular, I remember reading a story, I think in the Observer, where they interviewed proponents and opponents of Prop A. And of the proponents picked were a couple who said that any building on the lot would block the view from their $500,000 condo. And I was really surprised when it passed.  However, I have sadly not been surprised by the complete lack of progress that the so-called Center of the City Commission has made. I recently saw a number of tweets about the work that wasn't being done at this commission.  people smoking and drinking during public meetings. Just last week, I was walking down Division downtown to meet a friend, and the only people I saw anywhere near that lot using it were people, were a couple of teenagers on skateboards, who were actually on their way to Liberty Plaza, because that seemed like a better place to be able to try and do, you know, kickflips or whatever.  City Administrator Dahomey's recent report outlining the many ways that quote unquote activating the center of the city as a place for  food trucks, was thorough, honest, and, you know, as a previous commenter said, damning. I would like to join several other commenters, both at this meeting and I think at others in the past, to ask Council to step in. I think that we would all, as Ann Arborites, love to have places to gather.  Senator, City Administrator Dahomey's description of a potential splash pad and community garden at the currently named Fuller Park, I'm sure has been met with lots and lots of enthusiasm. 30 seconds. But it's also backed up by actual planning and expertise, which the center of the city doesn't have. We need to put our money where our mouths are and use them for things that are important. And right now, this boondoggle just isn't one of them. Thank you so much."}, {"start": 5464.841, "end": 5475.305, "speaker": "SPEAKER_21", "text": "Thank you.

I am also calling in to ask Council to take action to address the lack of progress that we've seen at the library-laden surface parking lot. In the nearly five years since voters narrowly passed the Charter Amendment to turn that parking lot into a public commons, there's been next to no progress towards that goal. The site remains a surface parking lot, the city is out tens of millions of dollars, and we're further behind in building much-needed housing as a result.  If Prop A hadn't passed, we surely would have had a free, usable public plaza in the splash pad by now, along with $5 million more in the affordable housing fund. The current state of the site, as emphasized by AC1 on tonight's agenda, suggests that significant resources would be required to transform it into a suitable space for even hosting food trucks, resources that we are understandably hesitant to allocate. The last meeting of the Council of the Commons  At that meeting one committee member appeared to be fully baked while the committee discussed and at best half-baked RFP for the space. It also seems that Library Green have been sitting on funds for who knows how long that they simply chose not to spend to accelerate the RFP. If the beginning of a draft RFP and  maybe food trucks, is all the progress we've had in five years, it's time to cut our losses and move on. Whether we repeal Prop A entirely or replace it with something more flexible, I would like to see us put the issue to voters this year. The longer we wait, the worse it is for everyone involved. We must make a decision as soon as possible to be able to move forward. Thank you for your time."}, {"start": 5584.36, "end": 5587.661, "speaker": "SPEAKER_21", "text": "Thank you.

I sent this to Council as an email, but I wanted to call in and read it into the record. I read this astoundingly brutal, I might add, memo last night and was struck by three things. First, Proposal A was passed in 2018, and we're only now looking at options such as food trucks.  We're coming up on five years. Everything about the center of the city and Council of the Commons or whatever the correct style to refer to this is has had a lack of urgency. We are coming up on the bicentennial with nothing to show for it. The Council of the Commons is still working on putting together a design RFP after nearly five years. I watched the most recent meeting and it was a disaster with one member interrupting and monopolizing much of the discussion time with a list of 18 vague amendments.  Towards the end of the meeting, he appeared to, as our elders would say, toke up. Looking back on the minutes from previous meetings, it doesn't seem as if they report much back to council, and it isn't clear to me what they've been doing all this time. Second, $130,000 a year for food trucks, if we can even do food trucks with the poorly worded charter language Proposal A saddled us with, and if we can find operators willing to take us up on it.  And I'll just use the proposed ballot explainer text for this, quote, four, the charter amendment does not provide a funding source for the development, maintenance, or programming of a park and commons, unquote. We don't have money to put food trucks here.  Please put an end to this charade. Don't let it drag on for another year or five. Dissolve the Council of the Commons so they stop wasting staff time and the time of the two council members sitting on that body. They aren't seeming to act as an advisory body to council anyway, so I don't think we would be losing anything without their input.  Pass a ballot initiative that allows voters to fix the mistake of Proposal A. Either strike the language entirely or, preferably, modify it so that the space can be developed to provide a public plaza, housing, and money for city priorities, which could include affordable housing, climate, active transportation, unarmed response, debt service, et cetera.  I don't want this issue to still be hanging over our heads while we are supposed to be celebrating the bicentennial. It's time to move on.

I just like to add my name to the folks who've already speak and spoken about the center of the city tonight. I really think that it's time to re examine this and put a valid initiative to the voters to let us decide.  Once and for all, after everything that we've seen over the past four plus years, whether it's worth putting any more time, effort, and money into this broken initiative that we embarked on, ostensibly for a public plaza, but really to stop a development downtown. A lot of the supporters who remain after the development was stopped are still divided in purpose and scope.  Other than a small flower bed, maybe a handful of events over the four-plus years, this parking lot is much as it was, with no real plans to change it anytime soon. I think the city administrator's memo is correct, and I think his plans for the rest of the city sound really well thought out and wonderful, and in stark contrast to what this group has come up with. It's time to cut bait. There's a dawning recognition in our city  that we must adapt and change to meet the growing crises of climate housing. And if we're going to devote time and energy into something, then let it be that, not window dressing on a parking lot.  The only way to change the use for this lot now is by amending the city charter and putting it to the voters. And it's within your scope as our city's elected leaders to do just that. And I urge you to do it. Do it this year. Put a ballot proposal forward and let the voters decide. Either to maintain the status quo as it is now, or come up with a new, progressive use of this plot that is right next to  the bus depot near the library. Something better than a parking lot.

Champions for Change  It's a program that recognizes that in vibrant communities all people are welcomed, included, valued, and nurtured. The racial disparities our communities face though prove that we're not there. Champions for Change inspires and cultivates leaders as we all work toward a co-liberated future. Together we can find new ways to disrupt the many forms of racism. Our community of practice is a space for imagination, healing, experimentation, and transformation.  Leaders of color are nurtured and supported as they grow. White leaders learn ways to wholeheartedly leverage their power and privilege for justice. Together, we're laying the groundwork for systemic change in our communities. I hope, as folks remember Jude's impact in our community, we can also uplift these efforts that will continue.

And, you know, unfortunately, as was noted by the labor representative, that doesn't  And even in our own community, we just had an accident in early March where a worker fell 40 feet from a construction site, was critically injured. We haven't seen any updates yet, but I'm following that. The OSHA investigation is ongoing. When that comes out, and regardless of that particular outcome,  I'm going to be working with our city attorney's office and our staff to see what can we do as a council, as a body to improve worker safety in our community on private construction. We've already done quite a bit for public construction with our new best value contracting policy. But in terms of private construction, the only avenues that we have are through the building permit process.  And so, for example, if this particular contracting company is found to have been negligent leading to that worker's fall, that contractor should not be able to work in Ann Arbor for a time.

The lawsuit seeks to ensure that Gelman complies with its obligations under the terms of the 2006 settlement agreement between the city and Gelman. That agreement required Gelman to install monitoring wells to detect dioxane near the Montgomery Street well, which was previously used as a source for the city's public drinking water.  If concentrations of dioxane in a first series of these monitoring wells exceeded one half of the residential cleanup criterion, Gelman was supposed to install a second series of these wells. When the state of Michigan reduced the dioxane drinking water cleanup criterion from 85 parts per billion to 7.2 parts per billion, that trigger became much easier to reach. And indeed, it was reached.  And so Gelman was supposed to install a second series of these wells. And it did not. So Gelman refused to do what it had said it would do. And so that fact establishes that it is both timely and prudent to enforce the city's rights to have the second series of wells installed by litigation, which is what this amendment supports.  These wells are important for the residents of Ann Arbor because they provide a warning system for contamination moving toward the Northwest Supply Well, the Montgomery Street Well, and there is money involved. If it becomes clear that concentrations of dioxane in the Montgomery Street Well are so high as to disqualify this well permanently as a source of residential drinking water, then Gelman may be required to make a significant payment to the city.

You know, we tend to hear from the same people, but I think we want to be hearing from members of our community that don't necessarily, you know, know about city council meetings or watch what we discuss. And that includes people who have been priced out of our community and would like to live here. They also cited our equitable engagement committee, which I also appreciated, just shows that they are, you know, attuned, I think, to our values as we move forward.  Also wanted to address a question that came up at my coffee hours this weekend Which was is the signal of a comprehensive plan mean that?

I'm the fleet and facilities manager for the city as well as the airport manager for the city and I appreciate the opportunity. I did receive four questions related to this agenda item.  from council members, and I'd just like to go through those. First question was, what happens in the event that Heron Aviation isn't able to find a new FBO partner? And it's good to report that Heron Aviation has actually already reached an agreement with Ace Aircraft to provide FBO services in Ann Arbor. Ace Aircraft, which is one of the two remaining proposals from the RFP 2119, has purchased the materials, supplies, and equipment  on the outgoing FBO Aviation Center. Aviation Center has also transferred their six leases for adjacent T-hangers to Ace Aircraft. Ace Aircraft is owned by Aaron Enzer, a long-time pilot, flight instructor, and tenant at the airport. He's also currently the president of the Ann Arbor Flyers and operates two local businesses. Second question was, what criteria  were part of the original recommendation to grant the lease to Great Lakes Air Repair DBA Beacon Aviation. So the Airport Advisory Committee has been trying to find the right FBO operator for the airport over a period of about three years through two RFP processes. The proposal from Herron and Forshler, which ended up being the Great Lakes Air Beacon Aviation, was recommended by the Airport Advisory Committee for several reasons.  The proposal benefited users of the airport by providing a competitive FBO environment. The proposers brought a good mix of business experience, and they were providing some new services to ARB, and they bring the solid financial resources to complete the required improvements to the building with no airport contributions. The third question was, was the airport advisory committee part of this decision?  If not, why? The airport advisory has been an active participant in the plan to redevelop this site for many years. Members, including those who served on the subcommittee that was developed for this specific proposal or process, have gone through two RFP processes, reviewed multiple proposals, and interviewed multiple proposers."}, {"start": 7952.007, "end": 8126.424, "speaker": "SPEAKER_11", "text": "The subcommittee re-evaluated the remaining proposals from Solo Aviation and Ace Aircraft, and the newly received proposal from Heron and Foshler. The subcommittee recommended to the Airport Advisory Committee, who concurred at their May 18th, 22 meeting, to move the Heron-Foshler proposal into the due diligence phase, and if it didn't make through the due diligence, then to pursue the proposal with Ace Aircraft. So as it relates to this most recent activity,  The request from Dale Forsler to put the lease in Heron's company name, Heron Aviation Group, came on March 22nd of this year, a week after the Airport Advisory Committee's March meeting and nearly two months before their next scheduled meeting. While a special meeting could have been called with discussions with the chair of the committee, the inclusion of Ace Aircraft into the Heron Aviation proposal was consistent with the recommendations previously made by the Airport Advisory Committee  ACE was a known commodity. They were a known commodity, and they were a known proposal to the Airport Advisory Committee, having been already an applicant through the RFP process. The last question was, what's the standard process for recommending lease agreements with a particular partner? There's really no established process for this situation at the airport.  Most of our leases are T-hangers, box hangers, and some private hanger land leases. These are formatted leases. They're standardized. They've been developed by the city attorney's office and at some point in the past have been approved by city council. Those are the bulk of the leases that we handle. Those are handled administratively.  and they usually are filled off of an operating or operating off of a waiting list for hanger space. What city council does see is lease extensions for corporate hangers, some amendments, those type of things when necessary. We don't see a lot of that because we don't get a lot of turnover, but when we do see it, it's typically an amendment or a renewal of an existing lease for the same tenant. This situation is very different in regards to  Actually, in the 16 plus years I've been the airport manager, it's the first time I can remember that we've brought in a new corporate entity for a corporate hangar. Again, most of the time, actually, since I've been here, all the time, it's just been renewal or amendments to leases, the same tenant staying in the same building. So this one was a little different situation, and again, it's just not one that's a unique situation, not one that they have a standard process for.

I'd be happy to address additional questions the council may have."}, {"start": 8126.424, "end": 8144.577, "speaker": "SPEAKER_34", "text": "Thank you. Councilor Bracken.

I think there's one other small tweak, but in terms of the actual contract that we approved back in November, it's an identical contract.  I appreciate the transparency of this process, and I think the fact that we as council are approving this contract, well, we're going to approve the contract, but have, you know, this is coming back to us as an amendment. The fact that it's gone through the airport advisory commission, it's been a  You know, we've seen due diligence at every stage of the process So I certainly don't have any concerns despite some some comments that have been made in the community on that on that point in terms of the process just to Reiterate there were four members of the airport Advisory Commission that have served on this  review committee throughout the process. So the airport advisory commission's been engaged in that. And then one of the great things about this that I think I just want to make sure that we all recognize is that we are getting $200,000 worth of required building improvements to this hangar at the airport. So that's  That's money that we aren't spending as a city to improve our facilities, but rather a private entity is coming in and making that investment in our facilities and our hangars.

Well, what could be more worthy than the health and safety of our 10 hours a day who have toxins nearby? I don't know. Cleaning up the contamination now seems to be the most worthy item on my agenda. I don't know what you all think about that. What it boils down to is that 415 is a city-owned property.  The city and the county contributed to the contamination over the years.

So I spoke earlier about honesty, intellectual honesty, about respecting our laws, the letter and intent, clearly does not respect the intent of our code, may very well not meet the letter of the law either.  Especially because this is a city application, not a private development application, we should be holding ourselves to the standard of meeting our own laws. Additionally, the Ann Arbor Historic District Guidelines have not been followed, as the previous scholar said. One of the things our guidelines say is that this needs to be designed to fit in and be compatible with the contributing structures in the historic district.  that were given to the historic district commission at working sessions, not an application that was voted on, but at working sessions, continue to show comparisons to structures off-site, outside of the district, and to non-contributed structures within the district. The guidelines are clear. We're contributing as very important and meaningful historic district ordinances. This project needs to be designed to be compatible  contributing structures in a historic district. Further, as was indicated by one of the previous scholars, the affordable housing here is a phantom. This is a site that is highly desirable for luxury housing.

It's unlikely to be affordable housing. It's on site. There'll be a payment in lieu. The payment in lieu is tracked from the purchase price from whoever buys the project.

That's another convo.  But it's centered around the three city properties at 1st and William, 720 North Main, and 415 West Washington. Our task force came up with three recommendations for the site. There was one architectural, which should be completely built upon. And the other was an open, which I'll discuss. And the other was sort of a blended emphasis. And I think the blended emphasis is finally what is coming before you.  I understand there's some compromises and a willingness to take care of the toxic site. There's always been suspicions, and we looked at that, about those issues certainly there. It's always been a past industrial area, so there's going to be some problems there.

We need to respect our floodplains and the floodway. When I sat on the Grounds Creek Greenway Task Force, I and a plurality of the members looked at the open emphasis.  which was to protect our floodplain and our front bridges. And we believe that the best way for it, the tree line or the greenway, was to use the city sites as kind of centers for a park-like system. Yes, it's going to be a circumstance where the city's going to have the burden of cleaning it up, and it's a situation that sadly is not going to go away. But it is our responsibility, and I think in the end, I think it's better  The city really needs to do a better job of protecting its natural systems. This is another conversation.

My biggest concern has to do with public health and safety and the overlapping issues of the flood risk at that site, which is an unknown and mapped by FEMA floodplain and flood fringe area. And to place that in the context of climate change and our climate emergency, during which we expect more  and frequent intensity \u2013 and intense flood events. Keep that in mind, because what's been proposed is only what's been known to date. So we just don't know the potential for the flooding. But our stormwater manager has said that this plan is one that will \u2013 is opposed to the Hazardous Risk Management Plan  for the city, and that makes me really concerned for the safety of the potential residents at that site, as well as those who may be called into action to support them in the case of a disaster. Combined with that is the risk of contamination that we know exists, and I feel like the attention has been paid specifically to the boundaries of the site.  and the contamination on the site. When we know that the contamination is a subsurface area around the site in a whole neighborhood, so it's not only the contaminants on site, but the  a plume of PCE that's flowing in the direction of that site that hasn't been adequately addressed. We don't know what the plan will result in in terms of control of the contamination over time and the control of the remediation. And that has me concerned.  Thank you. Also, well, I just think that if the federal government won't give money to support affordable housing in this place because it's at risk of flooding, then I think that it's probably a risky place for any person to be living.

My name is Mark Wishko. I live at 211 3rd Street. My property backs right up to 415 West Washington. I have been there for 45 years. I have watched the city neglect this site for all of those years.  And what we have today is a blighted site, the responsibility of the city. And now we're going to have a development that's going to create a wall between the neighborhood and downtown. And then the city is saying, I want somebody else to pay for this because, geez, it's too expensive for us. We have neglected the site for all of these years. We have contaminated it.  yet we don't want to pay for it? And we want to put people at risk by building in a floodplain? I am totally confused by this. We have the ability to be able to make this a transition from the neighborhood to downtown, not put up a wall between the neighborhood and downtown. We have a historic district that is supposed to provide that, yet this organization is trying to tear that down.  and work their way around the Historic District Commission. I'm aghast at this. This is just, to me, it's beyond comprehension that the city will neglect its own responsibility, look to put it upon a developer, and then walk away happy because, gee, we put up this big wall. We circumvented the Historic District Commission. We require all of the people that live in this historic district to abide by the Historic District Commission.  Right? Okay. Improvements that I make on my property has to conform. Yet the city is trying to circumvent those things. As you can see, I'm a little angry about this. To watch how this has just gone right along. My neighbors and I have been working for what, a year and a half?  to be able to bring this to our council members, to discuss this, to bring things to the table here. And what we get is this. I really would like to see this council  turn around on this project. This does not belong in this neighborhood. It does not contribute to the historic houses that we live in and that have been part of our lives for many, many years. Those homes are not a commodity. They are our homes.

I would echo the comments made by the opponents of this resolution. Many good points have been made. I think the one key one that I would like to emphasize is that  Can you really expect a developer to clean up anything beyond this site? It seems to me that the city is going to have to clean up the plume that surrounds this site. And how are you going to coordinate that cleanup without having control of the edges of it? Just think about that one piece alone.  I think is enough to get past the temptation to just have a developer do it so the city doesn't have to pay for it. The city is, after all, responsible for it from the get. There's no question about that, zero. And the city should take some responsibility here, regardless of what the cost is. Bond it if you have to. That's what you're supposed to do. The other point that I'd like to make is that if you go back to the very beginning of this process,  there have been some serious misrepresentations made by certain people during the course of it. The early webinars and the early meetings and surveys had a questionnaire that asked for goals and prioritizing of those goals. The lowest priority in the entire survey, both residents nearby and citywide, the last lowest score was for selling this property  in order to generate money for the Affordable Housing Fund. The bottom. Yet that has been the overriding goal. And now it's been pointed out several times that you won't even get any money for the Affordable Housing Fund because the developer will obviously just discount the purchase price by the amount that they would have to pay in. So the entire goal, which was ranked last  and has been driving this bus in any way, is a phantom. And if you approve this, just with those two components, let alone Jerry Hancock saying that it shouldn't be built there, and he's the stormwater manager, et cetera, et cetera, all the competing considerations that have been discussed, they are nauseam.  are just going to be the competing considerations always go by the boards in order to support new market rate, i.e. luxury housing, which will not produce any improvement in affordability whatsoever.

Some have suggested we make it worse. They've suggested we preserve this historic blight and pollution. Others seem to have been too easy planning their comments to pay attention to Administrator Dohony's financial warnings to council, as they suggest that the city could  dig into its apparently unlimited coffers to remediate the pollution here. Still others, worst of all by a long shot, use public comment to repeat long debunked Nazi propaganda. So what does this mean for 415 West Washington? Well, we're in a housing crisis and we're in a Nazi propaganda crisis. Insufficient housing, far too much Nazi propaganda. Fortunately, the city can do something about  At least the former. I'd love to see those PUD improved tremendously. And I think a council should tell planning commission to do so. Increase the, well, limit letters, but build something like University Plaza, or even just like the first in Washington, apartments less than a block away.  But please don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good. Just pass the small improvement now and let's improve it further later. Maybe while doing so we should also consider whether this blighted graffiti covered parking lot and abandoned building are at all worth being considered historic. Ann Arbor can do better than this.

We heard a variety of different viewpoints on this rezoning and  You know, this is obviously a very complex site for our community. The city vacated the property in 2007, 16 years ago. So we've been through a pretty exhaustive process to date to get us to where we're at right now. We have evaluated a variety of different proposals. We have looked at adaptive reuse. We've done studies on flooding of the site. We've put out an RFP in the past.  And and not been able to see that move forward and that's what's helped to inform us to what we are where we're at today and in taking this approach to identify what the community values are with this site and then develop a proposal that we can go back out to the development community with those priorities so that we can get something back that That meets our our community goals and values You know I've we heard  Variety of different comments tonight today, but I did want to touch on a couple of them one of which is is Fundamentally the the fact that this is a blighted and polluted site and that it's this is our site This is a contamination that we have contributed to as a city and that it's our duty and responsibility To clean it up and to clean it up now, and I I don't disagree with that at all that is  You know it is our responsibility to do that and and as I look at this proposal before us That's one of the reasons that that helps to motivate me to to believe that this is the right process For us to move forward when we get to I don't look at this as is the city We are asking developers to pay for this and  We will be paying for this. We would be using our brownfield, using a brownfield plan eventually to help pay for the cleanup of this. But it would be initially, that cleanup would be paid for by private development and it would be ultimately paid back  much of it through development, through tax dollars, through that tax revenue. So what we're not doing is going to our general fund right now to clean that up. And instead, we are able to get delivered a lot of our other community priorities in the process. We're building  more housing. We are protecting the chimney swifts that are there. We are identifying, we're protecting, not building in the floodplain. We are increasing our open space in that area. It's a complex site and I know that depending on the lens through which people are looking at this, you can come to, rightfully, I think a lot of different conclusions on this.

The rezoning petition is accompanied by a concept plan.  for an elevated residential structure of about 134,000 square feet that will be five stories at its highest point. A minimum of 60% of the site is required to be preserved as open space, and the tree-lined trail will be built by the supplemental regs. It is required to be built through that space. Affordable housing is also required and must be provided, the greater of 15% or 15 units.  The units may be provided on site, or a payment in lieu equivalent may be made. And we've thrown in one final requirement for good measure, which is the preservation of the Chimney Swift habitat. And I'm not trying to make light of habitats. I'm just trying to underscore that, yes, this is a complex site that many community values have been introduced into.  So yes, it is true that this site cannot be developed primarily for affordable housing, as the other city-owned sites are being developed, because we would need federal funding to subsidize such a development, and federal funding cannot be used here. But that doesn't mean that there couldn't be affordable housing units on the site, or that it won't pay into our fund. Now, the cleanup will be expensive. At this stage, we only have estimates to work with, but it sounds like it's up to a million.  to deal with the contamination, double that or more to dismantle the existing asbestos-filled building, and then more to establish reasonable stormwater control. You all heard tonight Mr. DeHoney say that he left one million unallocated from the general fund. This cleanup would require three times that, and so if we were to try to fund this out of general fund funds,  we would need to not do things that people urgently want us to do. You are absolutely right that this is the city's responsibility to clean up, and we are exercising that responsibility through the use of brownfield tax credits, which are designed exactly for the purposes of development and environmental cleanup, and which the city uses regularly. Finally, we've heard concern about residential development in a flood plain.  The concept plan would significantly improve the flood control that exists currently. The concept plan would remove a structure that sits below the flood plain, provide stormwater management where there currently is none, none at all, clean up on-site contamination, and halt both the in-migration and out-migration of further contamination, significantly reduce impervious surface.  and conform fully with the city's revised and strengthened floodplain ordinance, which was written by Mr. Jerry Hancock, who also wrote the hazard mitigation plan. And I think that's good enough for now, but I think there are many good reasons to approve it.

We approved a brownfield development project in Kerrytown off of Detroit and 5th Avenue for a 14-unit condo development. But that was after we were  a site plan was submitted for and then for us to vote on whether they could use brownfield tax incentives and then after that after that approval goes to the county board of commissioners and the county brownfield redevelopment authority. So I think we still haven't actually started that process. We're just speaking to the possibility once this is rezoned as a PUD  But I just want to point to how we've done this pretty close to where the site is in Kerrytown. And we've approved a much larger brownfield project, the Sartorius Bioanalytical Instruments parcel that was off of Research Park Drive. And we were pretty comfortable with working with that project there. We approved $2.7 million in brownfield assistance.  So if we are on this path of trying to remediate parcels so they can actually be used, I feel like this council has had the experience and understanding what that means and the impact and knowing that this would actually bring some timeliness to the cleanup and additional dollars that can be leveraged as an additional oversight with the city and the county and the state because we actually have to qualify under state regulations.  order to to capture these tips, so Should there be some?

Hello, can you hear me? Yes, we can. Thank you, Mayor. This is James DeMoore. I live in the third ward, but I speak to you as a former member of the city's planning commission, and I was that body's representative to the Allens Creek Greenway Task Force, which reviewed the potential of Allens Creek Greenway, now known as the tree line, although that's an interesting evolution. That's another convo.  But it's centered around the three city properties at 1st and William, 720 North Main, and 415 West Washington. Our task force came up with three recommendations for the site. There was one architectural, which should be completely built upon. And the other was an open, which I'll discuss. And the other was sort of a blended emphasis. And I think the blended emphasis is finally what is coming before you.  I understand there's some compromises and a willingness to take care of the toxic site. There's always been suspicions, and we looked at that, about those issues certainly there. It's always been a past industrial area, so there's going to be some problems there. And yes, it's something that should be looked at. That being said, your staff has been emphatic about protecting natural systems.  If I'm listening to you guys talk tonight and I'm looking at the trend and even many of the public speakers vote on the matter, I get it. You guys are great in terms of sending a progressive message to the city. You're on board with it. At heart, maybe you are there. But the one thing that you really are is that you're built on development, development, development. That's great.  If you want to move forward with it, that's fine. And in terms of getting a comprehensive plan, yes, we should be incorporating all voices. We'd be looking at all factors. And one thing you cannot ignore is the environment or natural systems. We need to respect our floodplains and the floodway. When I sat on the Grounds Creek Greenway Task Force, I and a plurality of the members looked at the open emphasis.  which was to protect our floodplain and our front bridges. And we believe that the best way for it, the tree line or the greenway, was to use the city sites as kind of centers for a park-like system. Yes, it's going to be a circumstance where the city's going to have the burden of cleaning it up, and it's a situation that sadly is not going to go away. But it is our responsibility, and I think in the end, I think it's better  The city really needs to do a better job of protecting its natural systems. This is another conversation.
