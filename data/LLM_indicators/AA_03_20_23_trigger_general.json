To date, 375 of those, or 71%, have been closed, leaving 153 that are still outstanding. The March 3rd and 4th snowstorm, we received an additional 456 forestry service requests."}, {"start": 321.965, "end": 553.668, "speaker": "SPEAKER_09", "text": "To date, 225 or 49% of those are closed. And when you combine what's outstanding between both storms, we have 384 pending requests that we're still trying to address. The city collected 215 tons of material the week of March 6th of this year.  That compares to only 98 tons for the same week in March of 2022. Collections for the month to date are 342 tons and we have expended $50,000 in order to achieve that. We still have a volume problem and we need to take various measures to address it.  Compost collection will begin one week earlier than planned and start the week of March 27th Residents will be able to place carts bags and bundled material consistent with our curbside guidelines one week earlier than planned This effort provides residents this effort  allows residents to place materials for collection in the areas field crews have already been through. So we've started the work. We realize we've got a massive effort in front of us. When we start this sweep through, we will go back where we have been previously is the point I'm trying to make.  Residents, not private contractors or landscapers can bring material to the city's compost facility that's managed by We Care Denali at 4170 Platt Road. The one cubic yard per day limit will be waived through the close of business on April 17th. We have also extended the contract with Davy Tree Expert  company with an emergency purchase order of $200,000. For full transparency with the council, I have signed that to keep the work going rather than stopping it until we could get the contract to council. We are modifying our approach by utilizing equipment  that will remove large brush piles from the curbside area, leaving only chippable material behind. So what we mean is, in simple terms, we'll use a claw to pick it up, which will allow us, again, to go faster. We have also contacted three additional companies and are trying to determine if they can help us to expedite the issue.  We estimate that it will take another month to make our way through the city. We are strongly encouraging residents to bundle per the guidelines. We will only be able to make one full sweep through the city. Residents will still be able to stage debris for pickup through the city's residential composting program, but it too must meet the curbside guidelines.  We believe we will need to expend a total of $750,000 in order to complete the suite. And I'll just say for the record, I support expending those funds and we will bring requisite contracts to council as soon as we can get them ready. But we need to keep the daily effort going.

Good to see you again. Good to see you. Ann Arbor is, of course, a community that you can scooch on up to get in frame. Perfect.  Ann Arbor is, of course, a community of cares and a community that works hard for its residents, for its community members. And no one cares more and no one works harder than social workers here in Ann Arbor, across Michigan, and goodness, anywhere else. And so March being Social Work Month, it is my delight to issue this proclamation.  Whereas, March 2023 is indeed Social Work Month, whereas social workers enter the profession because they have a strong desire to empower individuals, families, communities, and our nation to overcome issues that limit individuals' full potential.  And whereas social workers have worked for more than a century to improve and enhance the well-being of all people and follow a code of ethics that calls upon them to fight injustice, and whereas social work as a profession has upheld institutions of oppression and discrimination as most professions have, but with the help of our code of ethics, they strive to dismantle inequity within our profession and within society.  Whereas social workers positively touch the lives of millions of Americans each day in schools, hospitals, military, child welfare agencies, community centers, and state, federal, local government. Whereas social workers are the largest group of mental health care professionals and providers in the United States, and they help dismantle inequity through work in policy, community organizing, and research.  Whereas social workers have bettered our nation by focusing on intersectionality and advocating for equal rights for all marginal populations. Whereas the social work profession is one of the fastest growing careers in the United States, with approximately 708,000 social workers today and more than 60,000 expected to enter the profession over the next decade. Whereas Ann Arbor and greater Washtenaw County have benefited from the service and focus on alleviating inequity that social workers and leadership positions provide.  Now, therefore, I, Christopher Taylor, Mayor of Ann Arbor, in recognition of the numerous contributions made by social workers to our community, proclaim the month of March 2023 as National Social Work Month, and call upon all community members to celebrate and support the social work profession."}, {"start": 714.461, "end": 718.123, "speaker": "SPEAKER_16", "text": "Thank you.

My name is Dwayne Brizak, and I'm the Executive Director for the National Association of Social Workers, Michigan Chapter, and an alum of the University of Michigan. So I'm glad to be home. I'm honored to be here with you all today on behalf of Michigan's nearly 30,000 social workers and 6,500 students in schools of social work across our state. It's especially exciting for me to be here in home of my alma mater. Ann Arbor is host to the number one school of social work over the last decade at the University of Michigan.  You can just look around the county and see the impact that social workers have had in so many of the sectors that we work in, in developing leaders in behavioral health, non-profit management, politics, research, and clinical practice. I'd like to recognize this amazing social worker who's next to me today, who is Beth Angel, who's the Dean of the School of Social Work at the University of Michigan.  As we look around Ann Arbor, social work is everywhere. You may not know it's social work, but we are here, often behind the scenes or sometimes in front of the scenes, but maybe not with the label. From our national leading hospital system to the University Spectrum Center, the Jim Toy Community Center, our VA system, and the dozens of mental health clinics across the city. And even here on our city council, we have two MSWs with council members Ghazi Edwin and Song, so on our board here.  If we expand that out just a tiny bit further, Washtenaw County is rich in social work leaders, including the newest mayor of Ypsilanti, Nicole Brown, and the hundreds of future social workers coming out of Eastern Michigan University. Social workers are leading behavioral health efforts in the community mental health system and expanding community relations in the sheriff's office in Washtenaw County. So some places you may not expect to see our folks. And on the Washtenaw County Commission, we also have a social worker, Justin Hodge.  And at the state level, representing Ann Arbor, we have two MSWs with Carrie Reingens, our newest elected rep, and Felicia Braybeck in this county. And then at the state senate level, we have Senator Stephanie Chang, who got her MSW right here in Ann Arbor. So our social work community is rich and has ties to this Ann Arbor community.  Social work, as stated in the proclamation, we're rooted in empowering individuals, our communities, and our organizations that we work with. And we make sure to look at the intersections of micro, meso, and macro level work. As the fastest growing field in the United States, we know that we will just continue to expand our impact here in the Ann Arbor community. And so on behalf of our social work community here in Michigan, I just want to thank you all again for doing this proclamation and recognizing the essential work that social workers are doing in the community.

I am Dr. Larry Junk, a citizen of Ann Arbor, here to speak in favor of Resolution 230382. I favor asking our city to explore moving away from DTE as a supplier of fossil gas and toward alternative suppliers that will partner with Ann Arbor as the city steadily moves towards phasing out fossil fuels and moves towards carbon neutrality by 2030.  I'm a professor at University of Michigan Medical School, speaking on my own accord, but also as a volunteer for Michigan Clinicians for Climate Action.  My scientific training provides a foundation for understanding the effects of climate change on our world, and my medical training provides a foundation for understanding the health risks. To quote leading climate scientist Catherine Hayhoe, the difference between a higher versus lower emissions future is nothing less than the survival of our civilization.  I am most concerned about the following problems caused by climate change. Increasing direct heat deaths, extreme weather events causing flooding in Detroit and elsewhere, the unusual occurrence of three major hurricanes in the U.S. in the past year, widespread drought such as that affecting the western U.S., unprecedented loss of species, and threats to our agriculture and food supply.  As a physician, I'm concerned about the ongoing and severe health consequences of air pollution at present, also of mosquito-borne illnesses such as West Nile virus at present, and the threat of malaria returning to the U.S. in the future. In recent years, we have learned that the burning of fossil gas is a worse problem than previously known.  One reason is that it's drilling, fracking, transportation, and use in our homes releases substantial amounts of unburned methane, the main component of gas, which is even stronger than CO2 and causing climate change. Also, recent research shows a number of direct adverse health effects from gas leaked in our homes. DTE is far behind other energy companies in Michigan and elsewhere in moving towards sustainable sources of energy.  DTE appears to be paying little attention to the future of our climate or the health of our citizens. If this resolution passes, I urge city officials to explore the following. Is it true that DTE uses large amounts of rate payer dollars for campaign donations and for lobbying against sustainable energy?  Is it true that DTE uses my money to support their greenwashing commercials on TV, which ignore their foot dragging with sustainable energy?  And finally, is it true that four months ago DTE requested that the Michigan Public Service Commission approve large rate increases to protect high pay for its executives and high return to its shareholders? High pay and high returns to shareholders seem inappropriate for a company like DTE that fights to preserve generation of dirty energy using 20th century technology.

I'm calling tonight to state that putting residential housing at 415 West Washington would be a major mistake and very dangerous. New discussions at City Hall regarding development at 415  for residential ill-advised. The Palms Creek Group does not support this proposal. We communicated this to the City Council and Planning Commission several times. Earth Street Foundation, which is an open source flood modeling group, has been closely working with the Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, in recent years to update and greatly update the lowfall current floodplain maps of up to 33%  but they really are, and FEMA agrees. FEMA is now working on FEMA 2.0 to update their maps that they say are not accurate. Our current city leaders pretend to plan for global warming, but propose building residential, no less, in dangerous floodplain locations. For some reason, city officials failed to involve Harry Hancock in the evaluation of 415 plan. Planning officials stated, oh, our bad.  Jerry made comment anyway. Jerry Hancock, the city's stormwater and floodplain programs coordinator, raised concerns about the development proposal saying putting a large residential structure in the flood zone is inconsistent with the city's flood mitigation policy. Since 2004, the city's policy has been to look for opportunities to purchase floodplain properties and demolish structures. Chemicals on this site are set to be planted, to be cleaned, or treated, but may float  in flood water if a flood occurs, in addition to the chemicals coming from all the flooded cars on the site. These chemicals will migrate into the neighborhoods and contaminate homes in the Old West Side. R-15 West Washington site was flooded in 1968 in a 100-year flood. Reliable sources, it was more like a 50-year rain. When a meeting of city officials, the Watershed Council, and county officials were meeting in the building,  to discuss flood hazards. 30 seconds. And it seemed to be a drain commissioner with an attendant. His car was flooded in total, and they were trapped in this building. They had no idea they were in a dangerous situation with a flood soon to happen, which tells you how dangerous this site is. Flood experts were trapped in this building. The 68 floodwaters are very close to the train trestle at 415 at 10 feet, 6 inches. The site is, in all likelihood, has much larger floodplain  due to climate change from the low falling and their floodplain maps time much more dangerous than the maps suggest voters."}, {"start": 1369.657, "end": 1370.398, "speaker": "SPEAKER_15", "text": "Thank you."}, {"start": 1370.398, "end": 1378.162, "speaker": "SPEAKER_07", "text": "And our flood help affordable housing tax proposal without allowing the funds to be used in the floodplain."}, {"start": 1378.162, "end": 1382.805, "speaker": "SPEAKER_15", "text": "Thank you.

I am personally quite excited to see this project advance. I think the public benefits provided by it are really important to the city. And so I'm hoping you will not only approve this rezoning request, but take whatever steps are prudent to ensure that the project actually succeeds, it actually gets built, and actually provides all the promised benefits.  So talking about the benefits, as proposed, this PUD would involve remediating the environmental contamination on the site, would reactivate a long blighted site and put it to productive uses, adding badly needed market rates and affordable housing on site, and then the proceeds would help fund other affordable housing projects elsewhere in the city. This last bit is particularly important because we are seeing development costs continue to rise for affordable housing projects.  As I recall, there was a recent memo about the Catherine and fourth project discussing that increased costs are already becoming a problem. So our affordable housing millage is not enough. We need to take every opportunity we can get to supplement it. And this project would do that. However, it's clear. Also, this is going to be a difficult project to develop.  It requires environmental remediation. There are several additional restrictions in these proposed PUD regulations, including preventing construction in the floodway, requiring that the chimney be preserved, requiring that a segment of the treeline trail be constructed. By the way, on the last point, the proposed ordinance specifically requires collaboration with the Treeline Conservancy, which is a private nonprofit  By name in the ordinance, and I'm not I'm not sure if it's actually appropriate to or proper to name a private entity in a zoning ordinance like that. Maybe maybe I'll could look into that anyway.  The point here, I saw in Council Member Briggs' newsletter that she's planning to propose an amendment that would add even more development restrictions to this site around green building requirements. And I can certainly appreciate the intent behind this, but I would ask, has anyone evaluated whether such an amendment would impact the feasibility of this project? We need to make sure that we are not making the perfect the enemy of the good here. We do need this project to succeed.

I hope you had a chance to look at the material I sent yesterday that illustrates a little bit what I'll be talking about. As you know, you directed staff to restore the two and a half feet that were taken away from the bridge and the design to the west sidewalk on the bridge to make it ten and a half feet like it is. Now,  It may turn out that doing that requires adding an additional beam underneath the bridge. If that's the case, then it potentially could be six feet added there rather than two and a half feet, because the existing beams on the bridge that are there both now and in the current plan are just about six feet across, five feet, 11 inches, and a little bit more.  So it might be possible at minimal cost to widen that sidewalk. The main cost isn't the decking on the top. The main cost is the support structure underneath. So if we can get, using basically the same support structure, get some added width on that sidewalk, that would be beneficial.  And then instead of having a 10 and a half foot sidewalk there, we could have a 14 foot sidewalk with room for bi-directional bike lanes and a pedestrian lane. And in turn, that would connect to the planned trail loop under the bridge, which we hope to have built before too long and make it better for everybody and safer and more comfortable for bikers and walkers. Council Member Rodina responded to me, and I appreciate the comment, that the  issue before you says at least 10 1\u9226? feet on that bridge. And that's good that it says that, but it doesn't say to try to go more. What I would ask is that the council direct staff to investigate the possibility of making that addition wider than 2 1\u9226? feet, make it up to maybe 6 feet, so that we end up with a very safe and usable wider sidewalk there. So if we can make that  direction in some way to staff that would be beneficial, I think. Thank you."}, {"start": 1773.387, "end": 1780.933, "speaker": "SPEAKER_15", "text": "Thank you.

As a 30-year real estate professional, including experience as a developer, with your zonings in multiple communities, I want to speak about the latest in a pattern of problematic zoning actions noticed by experts in planning and zoning over the past several years.  The application for 415 West Washington clearly does not meet the intent of multiple laws and policies. Our policies do not intend for development such as this, at this location, which is in a historic district and almost entirely in a floodplain. The proposal is for a PUD based on D2 zoning baseline characteristics. D2 permits a maximum height of 60 feet tall, with 70 feet achievable with a premium.  However, the UDC states, quote, premium options may be applied only to lots that are located entirely out of a historic district and that contain no part of a floodplain. The D2 premium is clearly not to be used at this location. The proposal instead uses a planned development to achieve this very same thing, 70 feet instead of 60 feet, linked to a similar affordable housing premium.  Yet the UDC says that a PUD quote, shall not be allowed where it's sought primarily to avoid the imposition of standards and requirements of other zoning classifications or other city regulations. There's a more recently added premium that allows 30% additional height in exchange for affordable housing or sustainability. The applicant is basing its justification on this newer premium.  that replaced planned projects after the Lower Town lawsuit demonstrated that planned project section of the UDC was not in compliance with the Michigan Zoning Enabling Act. This newer premium makes no mention of historic districts nor floodplains. Since the intent is very clear in the first premium ordinance language, these two sections are thus in conflict.  The UDC speaks to that. Quote, where conditions, standards, or requirements imposed by any provisions of this chapter are either more restrictive or less restrictive than comparable standards imposed by any other law, ordinance, or regulation, the provisions that are more restrictive or that impose higher standards or requirements shall govern. So we are left with the intent of the UDC to not exceed the standard D2 height maximum of 60 feet in a historic district or in a floodplain which both  apply to this location. Additionally, the historic district guidelines have not been followed. They state that new buildings are to be designed to be compatible with surrounding buildings that contribute to the overall character of the historic district in terms of height, form, size, scale, massing proportions, and roof shape. This has not been designed to be compatible with the contributing structures in the historic district.  Please reject this application and send it back to follow our laws and policies.

We believe there is room to consider more than one design scenario, as was done for the Gettys Road Improvement Project. The city collaborated with private property owners and made adjustments which resulted in fewer trees destroyed, a shared use path, and bike lanes. Since Earhart Road currently has four lanes and the proposal reduces the road to two lanes, there is sufficient room for other design scenarios. As proposed, the city will paint Chevron lines over excess road surface.  Let's move the driving lane closer to the median and use the excess road for a bike lane and a walking path or a larger shared path. Constructing a sidewalk outside of the existing road will increase the overall width of the corridor. Keeping intact the existing property line and mature trees creates a narrow road visual, a known factor in reducing auto speeds. Additionally, the Route 3 bus stop at the corner of Earhart and Gettys is located just west of Earhart Road.  So most using the stop would have used the existing western sidewalk. All of the schools, churches, and other tributary streets to King Elementary Schools are on or connect to the western sidewalk. All residents living on the eastern side must cross Terre Heart Road at some point to reach those destinations. They will use the closest crosswalk to get on the west side of the street. The goal should be reducing overall road speed and on creating adequate and properly designed crosswalk  rather than creating a sidewalk to nowhere with gaps that will remain into perpetuity, like in front of Oxford Cemetery and Pineberry Street.

I'm calling from Ward 5 to speak about the rezoning of 415 West Washington, which has been  recommended by the planning department. 415 West Washington is a difficult site to develop, especially for residential use. That is because most of the site is in the floodplain. One of the highest authorities on building in the floodplain is the National Flood Insurance Program. And they are quoted in our own city website as recommending that, quote, residential uses in the floodplain be discouraged, end quote.  That, to me, is a very clear recommendation. Don't build residential in the floodplain. Locally, we have Jerry Hancock, our stormwater and floodplain programs coordinator. In his memo to the planning department dated February 6th of this year, he says, quote, for the past 19 years, the policy direction the city has taken for floodplain mitigation  through the various hazard mitigation plans has been to look for opportunities to purchase property, demolish structures, and lower the intensity of use in the floodplain. The concept plan to sell 415 Washington, this city-owned parcel, works at cross purposes to the city's floodplain mitigation efforts,\" end quote. But Mr. Hancock's memo does not  mentioned the toxins in the 415 West Washington site. Lucky for us, Rita La Caruso, Professor Emerita U of M, addresses the toxins in her March 17 letter to our mayor and city council. Her letter reminds us of two things. First, that both the benzene and the TCE found at the 415 Washington site are known carcinogens. Second, her letter reminds us that, quote,  Because of flooding risk, the possibility that flood water will carry pollutants beyond the site requires careful, knowledgeable analysis,\" end quote. The kind of analysis that personally I would trust only experts to do. So I urge the mayor and city council to heed the words of three experts, the National Flood Insurance Program, Sherry Hancock,  and Rita LaCaruso and send this plan back to the Planning Commission. It needs more experts to take a look at it. Thank you so much."}, {"start": 2715.998, "end": 2726.406, "speaker": "SPEAKER_15", "text": "Thank you.

These toxins are a hazard to everyone. These toxins should be cleaned up now, urgently. This is a city-owned property. The city and the county are responsible for the cleanup.  This responsibility should not depend on or wait on an unknown developer who may or may not purchase the site. Who knows how long that process could take? This is very urgent for the health and well-being of our entire community. We have been asking for several months, what is the estimated cost for the cleanup? Does the cost differ for use, if it's a park,  for residential or commercial uses? I was just recently told by my city council people that the cost is between one and three million, but for what use? Where is the data on this? How can the city make an informed decision with public support without the actual cost revealed? Whatever the cost, the city and the county need to find the money to clean this site up now.  We have a lot of bright minds in this city who could find ways, other than waiting, on a might-be developer. Don't wait. Please, don't shift the city's responsibility to clean the site up.

I really appreciate how the county is quickly trying to address this situation, but I encourage folks to contact our county colleagues and also contact the folks who are working on the ground doing assessments. So Mission, Alpha House, Avalon, Washtenaw Housing Alliance are trying to figure out how we could find a way to continue rapid rehousing as we did during the pandemic and hopefully find additional resources. We can always ask for more federal money, more state money.

Thank you. I just wanted to take a minute to mention something that's actually schools related. But we talk a lot about equity here. And there is a really important initiative right now, a fundraiser going on within the school district. The PTO Council, which is a group with representatives from every PTO throughout the Ann Arbor Public Schools, is doing a fundraiser.  This is the first of its kind. It's to raise money for Title I schools within the district for their PTO, to help fund and equalize their PTO budgets. This is a really important thing to me. I just donated today and I encourage everybody to donate if you can.  When I first became engaged with the schools, my daughter was a kindergartner at Dickin Elementary and it was a Title I school at the time. It has been on and off throughout the years. And I was shocked to learn that my daughter's school really struggled to fundraise.  to fund basic teacher supplies, classroom supplies, and the very basic field trips for our kids, while there were other schools in the district that could afford, through their PTO donations, to send every fifth grader to space camp.  every year. There are huge inequities within our district and you know back then I remember raising it at a PTOC meeting and it just wasn't something that people were interested in at the time but I'm really happy to see that folks have continued to work at it over the years and we're now seeing some interest in  somehow creating a little more equity between our schools. This is an issue that has only become exacerbated by the district's schools of choice within the district, the ability for folks to transfer to any school they want, and sometimes that ends up robbing schools of  resources. And so I really, again, I applaud the PTOC for taking this on. I hope it becomes an annual thing. I hope it will grow over the years. And I encourage anyone, they're just asking for 20 bucks.

They started with 200 and now operate 400. And some of you might remember a bike share program that we had several years ago that I think were mainly docked at the downtown branch of the library. It wasn't very successful, so it went away. And so there's long been talk of relaunching a bike share.  So we've been without bike share since 2017. This extension to this agreement with the scooters would be 100 dockless bikes, e-bikes to start. We would see how well it works. We want to make sure that there's not nuisances that come about and just learn our way around this and it doesn't lead to obstructions. We'll monitor and then hopefully we'll be able to expand it. I wanted to highlight some of the  cool things about what they're doing. So one thing that they're doing starting February 1st with the scooters and will extend to the bikes is equity considerations. So they have an access program which allows for people in affordable housing or of moderate means to get a reduced fee. And they've already established some relationships with our affordable housing complexes. They also have a special card that you can get so that you can use their vehicles without having a credit card, bank, or smartphone.  So really what we're trying to do is brought an opportunity to these devices One thing that the data nerd and me is excited about is that they have to share their data with us These are aggregate data not personally identifying But it can show us where use is strongest and where paths are being taken and I think that's going to help us a lot with our mobility planning so I'm really excited to support this tonight as a way of further advancing our mobility goals and Furthering our transportation plan."}, {"start": 3946.928, "end": 3976.87, "speaker": "SPEAKER_15", "text": "Thank you further discussion  All in favor?

This, to me, felt like something that the organization should be doing and doing well for their own efforts and for their efforts on behalf of the city contract that is awarded to them annually or has been historically.  I spoke with our city administrator, Mr. Dehoney. It was really helpful in that regard. And I'm excited about this, and I'm excited to support it tonight. I think that the difference for me is, or sort of what led me to want to support this, is the notion that we would collect data that the city is not able to collect on its own in order to inform our future economic development efforts.  Right now, our economic development efforts are centered around what our local development finance authority and the state direct us to do in terms of competitiveness, which is deemed driving industries. It's a very narrow focus. High tech industries, biotech, IT, you can look it up on the state's website, but there are five focuses, advanced automotive,  This would, in my mind, and to Councilmember Briggs' point, really expand that view and really be informative around where are the gaps, where can we better support business attraction, retention, acceleration, talent attraction, enhancement. I'd like to see what those gaps are and to really understand it so that as going forward, the city can develop an economic development strategy that meets not only the needs of those driving industry businesses, but the businesses on Main Street, other new emerging industries that might  afford us economic advantage and economic opportunity in the city. So I'm enthusiastic to do that. I think that some of the thought around, um, filling those gaps, um, should be part of the process of developing which cities to go to and benchmark against and which questions we ask.

And we've been fortunate that many people want to make things happen here. And so the city has continued to grow and develop without having a strategy directed by any one entity or the city.  we can do better. And this is just one piece of it. There are other pieces in motion. The Economic Development Corporation, of course, which I've talked about before, has broadened its mission to take a more active role in economic development activities in the city.  And this is going to inform a lot of the work that may be done there, as well as future work that may be done really on the city side as well. So again, I support this. I think it's a move in the right direction.

Thank you for having me here tonight. There were four questions that were posed to us, and I'd like to address those in the order in which I will receive them. The first is the purpose or the goals of the negotiation. To answer this question, I'd like to first start by stating what a franchise is.  Under Michigan law, a franchise is a contract between a local unit of government and a utility that does two things. One governs the use of the public rights of way and second sets the conditions under which the company may for a set period provide the specified utility service.  Franchises can also include additional terms, and several local governments across the country have successfully advanced affordability, equity, and clean energy goals via franchise negotiations, while also optimizing the use of public rights of way. In Michigan, you need to have a franchise to provide a service in the community.  Given the importance of the franchise and the reality that our existing franchise for natural gas provision expires in 2027, staff believe we should start negotiating a new franchise agreement as soon as possible and work to begin immediately ensuring that this new franchise aligns with our 820 goals, including ensuring that residents have choices that allow them to heat their homes and businesses with safe, healthy, clean, affordable, and stably priced fuel. Second question.  how this activity has the potential to advance our A20 goals. Staff believe that no resident should be forced to pay for energy that negatively impacts their health and safety and that is hazardous to our community.  That's why we see upcoming franchise discussions as an opportunity to provide residents with energy choices that are, as mentioned previously, safe, healthy, affordable, and clean. And this is where the franchise most directly intersects with A20, by exploring options that will allow us to heat our homes and businesses with clean, renewable, and affordable energy. This directly aligns with our A20 goals, specifically strategies two and three. Third question. Why this wasn't discussed earlier is an option.  As mentioned previously, our existing franchise doesn't expire until 2027.  is part of our work to help the community transition towards more sustainable sources of heating and cooling. Staff have been reviewing a slew of documents, including the city's existing franchise. Upon review, we noted the expiration date, as well as the fact that the franchise is terminable at will. Now, it's important at this point to note that historically, franchises have almost always exclusively focused on the terms governing the use of the public rights of way, or that first purpose I mentioned previously.  But given community discussions around achievement of a to zero staff began reviewing opportunities to advance the second purpose of a franchise, which is setting the conditions under which a company may for a set period of time provide a specified utility service.  This led staff to begin researching how other communities have advanced their climate and equity goals when selecting their utility providers. After several conversations with peer cities, a decision was made by staff to bring tonight's resolution forward to ensure we are notifying decision makers, the public, and potential providers, as soon as possible, about the city's opportunity to negotiate this new peaking franchise  and ensure it's consistent with best practices, certainly regarding use of rights of way, as well as full alignment with A20 and the city's affordability goals. And finally, fourth question, how community members' commissions will be included as we proceed forward.  If Council approves the resolution before you tonight, we will shortly announce a series of public meetings to share more details about what the franchise is as well as what is it is not and gather ideas from the public about what they would like to see included in a new heating franchise.  We also anticipate having a special discussion with the city's Energy Commission on the topic and opening a new email address where folks can send ideas and suggestions at any point.  Additionally, if the resolution passes, staff will prepare a formal request for ideas where Ann Arborites and potential utility providers or energy providers can send their ideas about how the city could achieve a careful transition to renewable energy choices for heating all of our Ann Arbor homes and businesses. Finally, staff have already launched a new city website to keep the public apprised of work on the heating franchise, and we will continue to keep that up to date.

You know, studies have shown the negative health effects of burning fossil fuels in our homes. And, you know, no person should have to sacrifice their health and their safety and their well-being in order to heat their home or their business.  So we are committed to this work of transitioning to a clean energy future while also improving, and this is a very important point, improving the reliability and the resilience and the safety and affordability of the city's energy.  Finally, what we do here in Ann Arbor, this is really exciting to me because what we do here in Ann Arbor can really serve as a model nationwide.

But there are other choices that are available. Certainly within A20 we are looking to prioritize and help people make the transition should they want to, to keep homes in greater efficiency. But there are other things like  For example, geothermal or different heating technologies that might actually prove more viable. So the idea here with the franchise is not just to talk to DT, but to talk to the entire marketplace and say, these are our goals. This is what Council's adopted and what our community is asking for.

We all know that the status quo is not acceptable. Ann Arbor residents, we deserve reliable, affordable, clean, healthy energy to heat and power our homes. By beginning these discussions,  We are looking to facilitate more energy choices for residents. We are listening to the vast majority of Ann Arbor residents, Ann Arbor voters, who supported our A20 plan in November. By their vote, what Ann Arborites did is demand that we transition away from fossil fuels, that we reduce in-home pollution that leads to asthma, cancer, and lung disease, and that we take aggressive steps to achieve our goal of community-wide carbon neutrality by 2030.  The council's resolution will empower the administrator to begin initiating a responsible, careful transition to sustainable heating in Ann Arbor.

I did want to comment on this, and so I appreciate the mayor's getting that straightened out and allowing this comment. This may seem like a small point to many of you, but I think that these types of claims  and the way their process does provide an important window that council can look in on staff and see how the staff is interacting with the public. And for that reason, I don't think you should change the current process. Ms. Briggs' proposed change to ask for a reporting on it is a partial solution.  But it doesn't really solve the problem of really eliminating your watching staff interact with residents. And I sent you a detailed email a couple of weeks ago when this came up the first time, first reading. And I won't go into the detail of that. But the gist of it was that I had what I thought was a totally merited small sewer claim.  It was initially denied. The person I talked to about that denial letter said, well, the city staff said they didn't cause your sewer backup, so therefore we denied the appeal. I went to an appeal hearing. I'm a retired lawyer. I went there. I had an expert witness from Dynamic Drain who cleared the backup in the drain. They said it was inconceivable that any other, there was no other possibility  other than the repair of the water main break in front of my house as to what caused that. The city attorney, a young lawyer whose name escapes me now, was pretty assertive and pretty aggressive, I would say, in saying, look, you can't prove that. I reminded him of the first year torts case, Paul's graph, which for you non-lawyers says, you know, if there's a giant explosion, you can assume it came from,  a particular train engine if it blew up the train. And that principle means you don't have to prove the details of something like that. And the appeal was denied again. And this was a little disconcerting. I don't think anybody without a law degree would have maybe gotten that far. And I had essentially threatened to go to court for small claims over it in order to get anything. I got another denial letter. And then it was with a settlement offer  $950 on an $1,100 claim. I took that, I had to dice with Abby Elias for several months about the settlement agreement because it was clearly an appropriate settlement agreement. I finally got paid almost a year later. I don't think that that was an appropriate way to deal with a pretty simple claim of a taxpayer.  I'm not saying current staff would have done that or the lawyer's office would have done that, but you would never, you're never going to know how these claims are being handled unless you actually watch them. That's all I have. I don't want it to sound like sour grapes. That's really not the point. The point is that it's a window into how staff interacts with the public, and that's very important, and I don't think you should eliminate that opportunity.

Good evening, Mayor and Council. Derek Delacorte, I'm the Community Services Administrator for the city. We did receive about eight questions related to the site tonight. We're going to do our best to answer them up front here, and then obviously both Mr. Leonard and I will be here to answer any questions regarding the project as we go forward. Quickly, I'm going to state up front that the project, the proposed PUD, is in response to City Council Resolution 2662.  that directed staff to present recommendations for redevelopment of the site, along with many others in the city, primarily for consideration of residential use. We've been at this for a considerable amount of time and are grateful to be here tonight to discuss it. The first question we have is a request for an amendment language to include sustainability requirements into supplemental regulations for 415 West Washington. It's stated that the goal is that any future building maximizes energy efficiency and is aligned with the goals of 820.  The question states, as I think all of us prefer that a building be net zero, but is willing to consider net zero ready, if that is more viable at this time. Staff and OSI, planning staff and OSI discussed this today and offered some language both in an email that was sent out to the asker and those who were CC'd on it and read in summary in the following. If it is desired to add proposed language, the following language,  is proposed by planning and OSI and can be added to the supplemental regulations. The referenced sustainability component of the UDC is defined as follows. When and where a solar collector surface covers at least 60% of the building's footprint area on a site and the electrical panels of the buildings have capacity to solely power the site by electricity, including any conduit and other necessary infrastructure for future conversions, this complete electrification is not achievable  at the time of initial construction. So the amendment would be the addition of the following language to the supplemental regulations, section four, PD regulations, G, any development of the property shall comply with the sustainability component of the unified development code. That is very briefly would apply that section of code to any project that came forward to the city in the future. Question two.  Has the city considered the option to clean up the site to recreation standards with the aim to absorb and conduct stormwater? As I understand, we have with other floodplain properties the city has purchased. If so, what would be the cost and how could that be funded? Answer recreational standards are determined on a site-by-site basis in consultation with the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy.  As staff has been working from the direction of the city council to explore housing for this location, the site has not been evaluated for stormwater infrastructure as its primary use. It is estimated that the cost of the environmental remediation for recreation would be similar to or higher than the estimated cost of residential cleanup. That is primarily due to concerns are increased when you have a recreational use about direct contact with soil and other use on the property.  As the city is likely a responsible party when it comes for paying for the remediation, it would be responsible for cleanup of contamination at the site without the benefit of any private investment to provide financial support through tax increment financing. Thus, the only real vehicle we know of right now that could cover those costs would be the general fund. Question three, have we considered the benefits  Perhaps in terms of savings on flood insurance, reducing flooding to surrounding properties, savings of emergency city response of making the site a floodway park. Response flood insurance rates are established citywide, while the decisions that the city collectively makes on property regulations and other measures can impact the city's flood insurance rates positively or negatively.  This is reviewed at a community-wide scale and does not fluctuate based on individual site decisions. Question four, floodplain maps. Can we trust these? Some have suggested that FEMA maps are inaccurate and outdated and the floodway floodplain is likely larger. Parentheses plus climate change. FEMA maps are the maps of record to base numerous policy decisions on  such as the floodplain overlay district adopted in 2021, which includes 415 West Washington. Actual onsite elevations are further used to delineate floodplain impacts on any site. And it has been stated, I think, on several occasions with this site, everything that is proposed and everything that will come forward to council will meet that recently adopted floodplain ordinance for the city in regards to these regulations.  Question five, does our remediation plan explicitly take into account that the site is a floodplain and permeable barriers work when there is flooding? Answer, yes. These barriers work in an area with flooding as it is often corresponds to a water table that is conducive to moving contaminants through the barriers to provide treatment. Question six, is the height of 70 feet in conflict with what is allowable in D2?  Answer, no. The height limit for this site in the D2 would be 70 or 78 feet, depending on the provisions of the Unified Development Code. Question seven. Is it accurate that the HDC has said they would reject a development that maximized the elements in the supplemental regulations? If so, are we presenting developers with a concept plan that may not be successful when it goes in front of the HDC in the future?  Response, at the recent working session, the Historic District Commission expressed concern should the project maximize the building envelope. However, it is also difficult for the commission to apply the Secretary of Interior Standards, which govern their review, to conceptual massing diagrams presented to date. The proposed PUD provides a limit, which any proposal will need to work within to meet the approval of the commission.  As demonstrated by ongoing dialogue with the Historic District Commission, they remain an important partner as the city moves forward with the design of the site with any development partner. And as you'll hear Brett and I talk about repeatedly tonight, at this point, it is important that we, we believe it's important to bring that development partner into the process so we can further provide the details the HDC needs to make such decisions. Ultimately, they have that authority to make an up or down decision on the outside  elements of the site. Would the cost be lower or higher for remediation if we weren't going to place housing on the site and we're seeking to convert the site to green space? In our conversations with our environmental folks, likely higher. As less physical development occurs on the site, the design, monitoring, and effectiveness of the permeable reactive barriers would become more critical as any design elements would need to address potential exposures that contaminate  For example, a stormwater pond or other recreational uses on site would provide a greater opportunity for potential contamination exposure than equivalent conditions under a building or parking area. I.e., if the site is recreational or not capped, the possibilities of direct connection to the contamination increase. Therefore, the cost of remediation goes up.  Again, as we've gone through this process, staff has been directed to this point to consider housing for the site, recreation and open space. It was not the direction of the council at this point. But we did have some time today to talk to our environmental experts. And that was how they advised us today on the site. That's all for the pre-printed questions. And obviously, we're here to answer anything else you may have as the discussion goes forward."}, {"start": 6445.355, "end": 6449.509, "speaker": "SPEAKER_15", "text": "Thank you. Thank you.

And either the greater of 15% or 15 units of affordable housing is also required, can be done on site or by payment in lieu, as is construction of a segment of the tree line trail. Mixed use will be allowed.  In 2019 council asked staff to explore developing housing on this site together with several other underutilized city-owned properties We learned early on that because it is contaminated and lies in close proximity to the railroad 415 West Washington would be ineligible for federal affordable housing funding and  The current site is vacant. It contains an existing building that is functionally obsolete, blighted, and sits four to 10 feet below the flood plain. The Historic District Commission approved its demolition in September 2018, judging that adaptive reuse would not be possible. The site is currently 100% impervious surface with no storm water controls whatsoever.  It contains remnants of road salt from when it housed the Washington County Road Commission, plus two highly flammable carcinogenic chemicals. As the owner of the site, the city is likely the primary responsible party for the contamination. Staff advises us, as you've heard, that our best strategy  For meeting that responsibility, cleaning up the site and serving affordable housing goals is to sell the site to a private developer and make a brownfield plan. A viable brownfield plan will necessitate residential development and we have specified with this PUD that it will require affordable housing payment in lieu or units.  We have heard concerns about pursuing residential development in a floodplain. Let me underscore that this PUD zoning will ensure considerably better floodwater management than what currently exists. It replaces a structure that sits below the floodplain, provides stormwater management where there is none, significantly reduces impervious surface, and conforms fully with the city's revised and strengthened floodplain ordinance, which council approved in January 2021.  That ordinance requires residential construction in the flood fringe, not the floodway, because you can't do it there, to be elevated one foot over a flood level that has a 0.2 or 1 in 500 annual chance of occurring. The city's floodplain staff wrote that ordinance to guide safe residential development in the flood fringe. The city's floodplain staff also wrote a hazard mitigation plan whose aspirational goals are higher than the standards of the ordinance. Council Member? Yes, I can come back to this.

As usual, Council Member Dish has covered a number of the critical details about the project and I'm sure she'll have more to share. I'd like to start by thanking Mr. Delacorte and Mr. Leonard and other planning staff for their extensive work on this really difficult site. What we have before us is a project that cleans up a polluted and blighted site in the Fifth Ward and advances a number of our community priorities.  Council Member Desch mentioned many of them, but just to review, we're mediating the environmental contamination, we're adding affordable housing in addition to likely other housing on the site or funding for affordable housing, protecting the chimney's swift habitat, where it would be construction of a 15-foot wide path with a tree-lined trail.  On and on, we are seeing improvements on this site. But I'd also like to thank the many residents who've reached out to me about this project, both in support and with concerns. The concerns, as we heard in public comment, primarily have centered around compatibility with the historic district and floodplain concerns. The HDC has reviewed and provided recommendations that have informed the supplemental regulations and concept plan, and they will need to approve the final plan.  Early on, the floodplain issues were what gave me the most pause with this project, and that's why one of the first things that Council Member Dish and I did after starting our terms was to sit down with numerous staff members from multiple specialty areas to discuss the trade-offs on this site. And Council Member Dish noted all the improvements that we're seeing in terms of floodplain management, so I'm not gonna review those. The one thing that I do think is worth discussing a little bit more tonight  is there's one piece that's missing from the supplemental regulations that is a community priority, and a pretty critical community priority. And that is the alignment with any future development with our A20 plan. So I'm looking at this through an environmental lens. Primarily, there's a lot of issues that are going  prioritized on this site, but fundamentally we are seeking to clean up a environmentally contaminated site in the Fifth Ward on a flood plain. What we put back there needs to be something that is not contributing to climate change, in my opinion, that is beneficial to the environment. So I'd like to put forward a motion. And that is to  basically to direct staff to develop language for the supplemental regulations that advances our A20 green building sustainability goals and results in an energy efficient net zero building or net zero ready building. I can discuss more if there's a second to that."}, {"start": 6831.4, "end": 6835.301, "speaker": "SPEAKER_15", "text": "What is the, can you restate the exact text?

Council Member Ackman."}, {"start": 6938.582, "end": 7111.946, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "text": "Thank you. First off, I just wanted to recognize that I'm coming in at the end of what I have learned has been a years-long process to identify a solution for the splited property in a flood zone. And I really appreciate the work of planning staff, planning commission, community members to identify a way forward. I think there's a lot of considerations with this project.  that don't make the decision necessarily a simple, easy, straightforward one, which probably explains why it has sat like it is for so long. So I just wanted to say a few words about the values that I'm thinking about as concerns the PUD before us.  Number one, the creation of desperately needed housing for our city, including affordable housing. We're in a housing crisis. I plan to take every opportunity I can to address this issue by making sure that we add more housing where it makes sense. Two, as has been mentioned, the cleanup and toxic remediation of the site. We know this site is a brownfield containing toxic pollution and it is spreading under the street to the surrounding area. It needs to be cleaned up.  So we don't want it to continue sitting in the state that it is. Three, that it's done responsibly and with climate change and community resilience in mind.  As I said, this property is in a flood plain, something that several residents have reached out to us about. We know that we're experiencing more extreme weather-related events, such as flooding. And our community in the greater state of Michigan is poised to be a climate refuge. And as spelled out in our A20 plan, we know that we need to build resilience to climate change, which is something that I really value.  So when I grappled on this topic about whether this was environmentally sound or puts our community in danger, I was looking at the plans that specifically dealt with this. And I think as Council Member Dish said, we need to recognize that what's being proposed is a vast improvement from a flooding perspective than what has been sitting there for decades.  Also, the PUD turns the entire floodway into the treeline trail, which is a massive community benefit. Right now, it's covered by impervious surface. Second, the residential portion is in the flood fringe and would fully conform, or if I understand Mr. Delacorte's comments tonight, exceeds the recently adopted city ordinance that stipulates how residential developments can be built in our city today.  Lastly, it's important that we have a way to pay for it. This is going to be expensive. Now we know it's going to be even more expensive if it's for simply just recreational use with no residential. This plan doesn't put the city on the line to pay for it. Again, something that has been sitting there for years with no solution. So those are the things that I'm thinking about as I consider this."}, {"start": 7111.946, "end": 7116.047, "speaker": "SPEAKER_15", "text": "Thank you. Further discussion? Councilor Dish."}, {"start": 7117.98, "end": 7250.505, "speaker": "SPEAKER_27", "text": "Thank you so much, Councilmember Ackman and Councilmember Briggs. Those are both really eloquent comments. I did want to, again, address head-on the tension that people have raised between the aspirational document of our hazardous, oh God, the hazard, I'm sorry, Hazard Management Plan and the Strengthened Floodplain Ordinance.  Want to say that the ordinance is and should be not just that it is legal to legally But it should be the deciding standard The ordinance provides guardrails for making prudent land use decisions in a context where we seek the best balance between stormwater management and other city priorities such as Councilmember Ackman just mentioned  situating housing within walking distance of jobs and services. The floodplain concerns people have raised with respect to 415 West Washington aren't really about this site. They raise the broader question whether we trust the ordinance that floodplain staff has written and council passed just over two years ago. If we want to change the floodplain ordinance to match our aspirational goals for stormwater management, we can do that. But we need to ask ourselves how the urgent concern about housing supply in the city stacks up against  an ideal standard of meeting our highest aspirations regarding structures in the flood fringe. And I will underscore what Council Member Ackman just said, which is that if council opted to turn the property into a park without any residential use on it, the work of demolishing the structure, remediating the contamination to the highest level, and preserving the habitat would cost millions of dollars for which we have no funding source other than the general fund which is committed  Moreover, I would like to say that this process was designed to provide us with what staff considers to be a feasible project and a good balance among competing city priorities. We are often in the situation of leaving it up to the developer, who is an interested party, to give us their opinion on what can and can be done. In this case, staff from multiple departments have provided counsel, and they have reached agreement."}, {"start": 7250.505, "end": 7256.651, "speaker": "SPEAKER_15", "text": "Mr. Delacorte.

Council Member Briggs and I had our monthly coffee, or office hours, or however you want to phrase it, yesterday. And as you can imagine, this really dominated the conversation. And I wanted to make sure that I addressed some of what we heard.  And we heard, I heard, I should say, that this action feels rushed and sudden, which seems very confusing to me because although I'm new to council, this has been on my radar for years. As a fourth ward resident being invited to participate in public comment on it, there was a survey around it. I think that the city has done a lot of work.  Around this property and I really applaud city staffers for sticking with it so I just I want to highlight that again that this is not something that is brand new and sprung up and you know, we're trying to Rush I think that it's been a very thoughtful process to date and  I want to point out that there's been criticism of neighborhood character, talking about whether or not this should be a park. I think Council Member Dish brought up some really important points that if the city opted to turn this property into a park, it would need to identify funding for the demolition of structures, the remediation of environmental contaminants, construction of the tree line trail, and preserving of the chimney for the birds.  which would total millions of dollars that is unbudgeted from city funds. So truly, we would need to rob Peter to pay Paul to accommodate some of these. And we know from our pros plan that the city does have an ambitious parks and recreation plan, and funding has been thoughtfully dedicated toward those priorities that were informed by the community at large. I think that's a really important point to this. I think it's also noteworthy that our partner in this,  the Treeline Trail, has also identified that there is no available city funding for this type of project in terms of creating recreational space on this site. And that creating and funding its perpetual maintenance is beyond the scope of Treeline's mission. So again, this becomes the city's responsibility.  The other thing that I want to point out is that when we talk about brownfield credits, there's been a lot of talk about the city assuming responsibility for this, cleaning things up. That is exactly what this tax increment funding is there for. This TIF capture is tax dollars that the state returns to local.  So governments, in order to advance important projects within the community, this is exactly what this tax credit is designed for. It is a common economic development tool. It is not one that's being pulled out of a magic bag to pay for this. We see it in terms of our own funding.  TIF funding is used for Ann Arbor Spark activity. It's used for DDA activity. This is not new here in the city, nor is it new anywhere in the United States in terms of it being an economic development tool. I think that this site is walkable, obviously. I walk through the site every day on my way to work. It is walkable. It's close to town and transit. And I think that this would be a highly desirable property for a developer to acquire.  I'm interested in hearing feedback from colleagues on the sustainability aspects of this property development. I think if this is one we're going to swing for the fences, it's the opportunity to do so. And I think that the plans that the city has put forth right now in order to do this checks so many of those boxes and is already quite ambitious. I already mentioned the Chimney Swifts, the Treeline Trail, developing a new West Washington streetscape, which I think is really important. And it also provides setbacks that are greater than what is required.  Increases our flood storage capacity in the floodplain. That was some around the flooding issues and safety That was a lot of feedback that we have heard consistently And it reduces the impervious surfaces on that floodplain While counseling using the building coverage in that floodplain, so I'm supportive of this further discussion Councilmember Briggs All right, sorry for that procedural nightmare for a little bit I"}, {"start": 8042.41, "end": 8203.503, "speaker": "SPEAKER_06", "text": "To go back to the sustainability component, so the supplemental regulations are the guidelines that we're going to be going out to the development community and asking, they're sort of the guardrails for this project. What do we want to see come back to us? And so if we don't have anything in there that says that we want to have a building that complies with our A20 plan, it's unlikely that a developer is going to bring that back to us.  This is something that planning staff, in terms of our conversations today, it's clear that it's gonna take a little bit of time to create that language that is something that everybody can kind of, it's appropriate from the legal department's perspective, appropriate from planning department's perspective. So I welcome people's feedback on this in terms of their support and I think that's what staff is also looking for is a little bit of feedback on that to make sure this is not just  Not just me, I know Council Member Cornell and I have had conversations around this, and I think we're fairly in alignment on this. I am looking at what we're doing on other city-owned sites. Our affordable housing, where we're maximizing affordable housing, those are all the 121 East Catherine that we approved the transfer of ownership to the Ann Arbor Housing Development Corporation. It's going to be going to Planning Commission tomorrow.  and the language in that is extensive on it being a net zero ready building and discusses many energy efficiency elements that we expect to see as a part of that project.

So I know from my perspective that's really important when we eventually get a development back to us that it is in alignment  what voters have approved through our climate millage. It's in alignment with our A20 plan. So, you know, I think it's, in terms of the language that was suggested here, in terms of amending the regulations, I would have supported that tonight. I think that that's essentially the intent, is to at least have an A20-ready building, if not more. You know, this is a site that's in the flood plain, obviously, having features that  eliminate runoff, water runoff on the building like a green roof are also obviously important elements in a project like this.

I want to thank Councilmember Redina, Councilmembers Ackman, Ghazi, Edwin, and Harrison for also being informative and helpful in bringing this to the table. I also want to thank the Renters Commission, who offered really valuable insight and feedback on this when it was taken to them for their input. Basically, what this ordinance does is amend the housing code within the city  to require residential rental units to have a carbon monoxide detector. It's currently not part of existing rental units. So the state does require, if you are building a new rental unit, that you do have to have carbon monoxide detectors. But as we know, there are a lot of existing.  much older units here in Ann Arbor for which that does not apply. So this would, very similar to what is required for smoke detectors in Ann Arbor, it's another level of safety and security for residents here. The one thing that I did want to point out to my colleagues is that we received later this afternoon a substitute amendment.  The change in this, just so that you know, is that it was pointed out that some boilers and furnaces and multifamily dwellings, so three or more apartments have heating systems that are not contained within the dwelling specifically. And so under the initial version of this ordinance, those units would have been exempt from having CO2 detection because they do not have fuel-fired appliances within the unit. So this covers that gap to make sure that it is inclusive of all different types of rental housing in the city requiring carbon monoxide detection units.  The other thing that is really important, I think, to point out here is that the  The maintenance and the ongoing assurance of safety within these CO detectors is the landlord's responsibility or the building owner's responsibility. So I think that this is a really strong step forward in terms of making sure that our renters are safe and that they aren't at risk of CO poisoning. So I would welcome everyone's support for this ordinance."}, {"start": 8543.894, "end": 8557.91, "speaker": "SPEAKER_15", "text": "May I infer an amendment to substitute the  For the substitute resolution seconded by councilmember Radina discussion, I mean, I assume that's friendly to the body Excellent.

As we all know, civic flags, municipal flags, can be an incredibly important part of and component of civic pride. We also know that that really isn't the case here in Ann Arbor, in part, I believe, because the design of the current city flag does not meet proper vexillological principles.  That is to say, simplicity of design, use of symbolism that is meaningful, two or three basic colors, no lettering or seals, and distinctiveness, or relatedness if it's appropriate in the context. Municipal flags can be an important part of community cohesion, building enthusiasm for the municipality,  infusing civic pride, and it's something that I'm excited that we'll have the opportunity, perhaps, to bring forward in connection with the city's bicentennial in 2024. For folks that have seen the reference in the agenda, and with respect to the resolution, I'd encourage folks to check out the Good Flag, Bad Flag  flyer and folks who are interested in, since I have the floor, talking about one of my favorite podcasts, 99% Invisible, which Roman Mars talks a fair bit in the TED Talk and in a particular episode about the importance of city flags, their principles, their design, and their opportunities.  I'm excited about this. And I'm particularly glad that the Public Art Commission is interested in shepherding this conversation. They've done and had great success over the course of years with having community design projects for public art that has been important to the fabric of the community. I'm thinking with particularity, at least, of the Manchester Water Tower. And I'm hopeful that this can prove an even greater success.  Further discussion?
