These photos I'm going to show you  are of a school crosswalk, a school crosswalk that's used, a school crosswalk that has been in discussion since 1996 when the city hosted a community hearing. Why do we still have a sign here that you can hardly see, and this right here shows what the crosswalk sign looks like  for the opposing traffic, and the other crosswalk sign is over here and not even legible. Now, this is not a complex problem. This is not like sustainability. This is not like all of the issues we're facing with A20. It's just a very basic process. But Ann Arbor doesn't seem to like basics. So anyway,  Got ahead of myself. I have talked to the mayor. I have talked to council members one-on-one I've entered a to fix it tickets and it's obvious that the city simply lacks the political will and operational capacity to maintain safe school crosswalks For this reason I plan to use the same model  that community members used in 2016 following the death of a student in an unlit crosswalk. Concerned citizens formed A2 Safe Transport and effectively advocated for improvements in the school walk zones. The city responded by adopting A2 Safe Transport's plan and allocating millions of dollars for crosswalk improvements, lighting, RRFBs, consistent signage, et cetera, to improve the school walk zone.  Today, I encourage community members to join together and apply for a SAC grant as a chapter of Families for Safe Streets, an established nonprofit to address obstructions in the public right of way. There are three goals. One, to create a community education program.  because most people don't understand the public right of way. In fact, some people on the planning commission don't understand the public right of way. Two, to develop a roadmap for the city, what we need to do going forward.  And I think we need to be very prescriptive because the city is still having trouble flipping crosswalk signs. And three, to work with the state officials to expand the Michigan Vehicle Code to cover the public right of way.

And this is all I think about because it's happening, and it's real, all right? What motivated me to be here today is I woke up and I looked at the bond market, the 10-year yield, okay? Now at 4.3.4%.  And it keeps going up, all right? Why is it going up? Because the market's pushing it up. Why is the market pushing it up? Because of inflation expectations, all right? A currency crisis is when the currency that we use loses its purchasing power. This is municipal because this applies to society, okay? This is our community that we need to step in and help. Loses purchasing power. It stops functioning. It doesn't work like it used to. And this manifests in rising prices.  And this added cost of living essentially makes everyone poor. Everything we used to take for granted is now more expensive, mainly the things we really need like food and shelter. As the currency continues to erode, life gets harder, resources get stretched, the cost of everything keeps going up. Inflation precipitates societal decline.  59% of people with student loan debt have said that when student loan payments resume next month, that they will need to make a choice between making their debt payment or buying groceries. Credit card debt is now over 1 trillion and rates keep rising. People are at the brink. This is an emergency and we need to step in and do whatever we can to help our community.  We need to reduce the cost of living for our residents. Yes, we need to reduce taxes greatly. Reduce the size of government, I'm sorry. Reduce the city's debt burden, reallocate expenditures and human resources into providing essential safety nets to help keep our people productive, happy, and healthy. We need to empower people to keep their homes.  We need to develop a self-sustainable economy based on conservation, rural production, and agriculture. We need to make sure our people are fed. So, I study this a lot, and I'm fairly convinced this is what's happening, and it's pretty scary. So I want the city to  at least consider these words and what this could mean for our future. Because I think everything is going to have to be rethought. All our expenditures, what we're doing with the money and where it's going, it all needs to be rethought before it's too late. And I hope we can put it right back into the community and keep the community healthy as much as possible. Thank you.

I'm here to speak on CA12, the payment in lieu of taxes proposal for a development on Stadium Boulevard on an old car dealership lot. I'm happy to see the progress to our new TC1 zoning. We'll have its first residential  option, an option that was not available before that was done. So that's a real sign of progress. I will note the challenges of building housing on what is almost certainly a brownfield site. Car dealerships are not known for, I guess,  Car-centered businesses in general are known for their pollution of groundwater and other things. There's a whole bunch of concrete on the site. There's going to be a lot of work to clear it and prepare it. And I would not be at all surprised if the Brownfield Commission or the body as a whole will have to deal with that at some point in the future. I don't have any special knowledge, but that just seems to be likely.  I'm looking forward to more neighbors on that site. It's been bleak for quite a while. Most of it was cleared. There was a building, a five-sided car dealership building, which I'm sure someone thought of as historic at some point in time. But now it's just bare and vacant. And I'm looking forward to the efforts, which I'm sure will be complicated and involve details of public finance that are beyond me to make it all work.  I will say that the city does have a history of successful transition of car dealerships to other uses, just like we have a history of transition of gas stations to other uses. And I'll point as an example to the Whole Foods site on Washtenaw that if you have a long memory, or if you don't have a long memory but have looked it up somewhere, used to be a car dealership there.  So it's entirely possible to take a site that was acres of parking and turn it into something that's a dense use. I just warn you that you may actually have to spend a little more municipal money to bring the site up to a level where you'd want kids to play on the grass.

My background includes participating in the Development Natural Features Subcommittee for the 1995 Ann Arbor West Area Plan. That was a long time ago. And being a former planning commissioner for Ann Arbor Township.  In all these activities and others, including the latest Ann Arbor Planning Commission publicized notice, recommended R1A.  I continue to agree, so did not attend the Planning Commission meeting, never thinking that anything else would be different. I consider a Blanket R1D zoning an inappropriate and would like City Council to respectfully consider Properties 2775 and 2737 Newport Road be changed to the original staff recommendation of R1A with the following reasons.  It's consistent with the present land use element of the comprehensive plan and R1 zoning. It's consistent with the surrounding zoning of R1A in the city, but also R2 in the township. It's a smooth transition from township to city density, as these are the first two properties coming into the city.  These properties on Newport Road are on or very near a dangerous curve. Accidents have occurred. To have that small corner be built out to 12 dwellings on a 1.7 acre lot would increase the likelihood of an accident with limited sight lines and it's irresponsible. Council might also consider parkland for the Rudolph Steiner property.  as there is already a 1986 memorandum of land contract which includes an easement in favor of the public for the use of existing and future exterior playground and nature areas on the premises.  R1D will drastically increase the impermeable surfaces on the hilly terrain from the present percentages. Existing rain gardens on the school property help control water quality, retention, and detention. The township and the city have a water sewer agreement.  There is a water T valve on the west side of the Steiner property to be used in the case of emergencies to provide water to the adjacent township properties without being annexed into the city.  Is there enough is there enough line capacity for the present load future build out at our one D levels and the township subdivision. I originally thought it would never happen but the Gellman plume is knocking on our door. Thank you. We have six pages and then the of the protest petition petition. Thank you.

I work in commercial real estate, so I've been before councils like this, usually asking for a zoning change or a variance. But when in those positions, I've worked with city officials to ensure that our goals are aligned and that changes are in keeping with the surrounding areas.  Never have I witnessed municipal spot zoning indiscriminately like we're seeing today, especially against the will of the actual parcel owners. While I understand the directive to increase density, there's a right way and a wrong way to do things. And I feel that this is clearly a wrong way to do it. My family and I moved to this area  about six years ago because of the lack of density. The larger lots that make up the area, land around us had already been developed in a thoughtful, consistent manner. There was nothing to indicate or feel that our area would change. You know,  The extreme zoning change that we're talking about here today will negatively impact the quality of life for the people in the surrounding area. As alluded to previously, Rudolph Steiner is the largest parcel that's up for spot zoning today, and they signed a petition against that zoning change.  When these, and again, while it was mentioned previously, when these properties were annexed, the point was to join with a R1 zoning designation, not an R1D zoning designation. By changing it to R1D, it completely contradicts the essence of that approval and of that recommendation.  The anticipated zoning change from R2 to R1A is already increasing the zoning density from one house per acre to one house per 20,000. So it's already doubling it. Now we're talking about going to almost nine homes per acre. It's completely out of touch with surrounding areas.  Additionally, not to my knowledge, again alluded to before, there haven't been any traffic impact studies done. There's been no watershed, no environmental impact studies done, which would be required if a developer brought this to you, right? You would say, show me all these reports showing that someone's not going to get run over, that environmentally it's sound.  You know, but none of that has been done, not to mention the fact that there's easement rights on the property. The biggest property that you're trying to include density on, you can't even do it because there's easements already on the property. I think in general, it just shows a lack of forethought that was done in this. It's sort of a system wide, just increased density. And again, sort of not what we're looking for in this area.

I came tonight to ask you to zone 2775 and 2737 Newport Road as R1A for several reasons. The people, the wildlife, and the heart and soul of the city itself.  Ann Arbor is a place that has the benefits of a city while being in nature. Since the pandemic, cities such as San Francisco have been extremely threatened, existentially threatened, with work from home workers leaving and moving out to places that are less expensive and more rural. In San Francisco, property values and tax revenues have plummeted.  Apartments lie vacant, businesses such as local coffee shops, hair salons, clothing stores, and grocery stores have closed, and everyone from business owners to landlords to janitors who once cleaned these now-closed businesses to the city itself that is now collecting far fewer taxes has suffered. It is widely believed that that city will never fully recover. So far, this hasn't happened in Ann Arbor, because Ann Arbor is lucky enough to be surrounded by trees.  to be a city that feels like it's in the country. If the city starts zoning properties to have higher density of housing, it will lose this appeal and people will flee. They will work remotely somewhere else, buy coffee somewhere else, buy books and groceries somewhere else, and the city will cease to exist as we know it.  In the short term, schools will be overcrowded. Taxes will go up to pay for the extra services, for the extra citizens, and there will be congestion on the roads. In the long term, the schools will be empty, property values will go down, and we will likely never recover.  As for the wildlife, I'm sure that you are aware that there is an overpopulation of deer in Ann Arbor, and they are sick due to a lack of food and natural predators. Human development caused this problem. The denser the human population, the worse it will get. Not just the deer, but other animals and native species will be killed off, and those sorts of changes tend to have disastrous effects on the environment as a whole.  Currently, there's an informal wildlife and conservation corridor coming down the hill, starting at Skyline and going to the river. This runs through these properties. A zoning of R1D would stop this daily animal movement with the potential of causing irreparable damage to the ecosystem.  If properties like 2775 and 2737 Newport Road are rezoned for a higher density of housing, the essence of Ann Arbor, what makes the city desirable to live in, what makes it a place that draws people here and encourages them to stay will disappear. Wildlife will get sick and die and people will abandon the city. Those who will ultimately pay the price will be the lowest income workers who won't have businesses to work in and the city itself.

We've been around for quite some time. And again, I'm speaking in opposition to the Heard Ordinance. And again, I do want to thank staff and council for listening to our concerns and really going through the ordinance itself and making some changes to it that do make it practical.  But I also want to point something else out that two weeks ago when staff was reporting, they brought up a really interesting point that was based from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory study. And as I researched into that, I found a couple of other studies. There's a lot of information on this topic. I'd like to read from one particular quote. This is from the Behavioral Perspectives on Home Energy Audit Study, also by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.  And it reads, despite success stories, the results of home energy audit programs overall have often been considered disappointing. Relatively few households undertake audits, and when they do, upgrade recommendations are often not acted upon. And though there is clearly remaining technology potential, little has been proven about the overall energy savings that results from audits and resulting upgrades.  nor the extent to which actual social behavior can reach technical potential. And I think the point is that this reinforces what the Portland 30-month report showed, and that was that buyers simply don't make upgrades and changes based on having an audit in hand. They're tapped out. Here in Ann Arbor, our average selling price year-to-date is $630,000.  up $30,000 from a year ago. Prices are climbing. When someone buys a house, they're all in. They've spent it. They really don't have dollars to put into it. And then also, the way that we're looking to implement this really has a tremendous cost. We're hiring a staff assessor. When we look at the expense of that staff, all in with  their benefits and such. When we look at contracting out for peak times, which probably will be at least half of them would be the assumption during those peak months, they're just simply not going to be able to do it. You look at administrative costs, technology costs, going back out in the end and really the enforcement side of it. This is well more than a $200,000 a year  venture into doing these 1,300, 1,400, 1,500 homes a year. So I would really just simply say that there's got to be a better way to do this. Let's find Ann Arbor residents that want to have this done and have the financial resources to be able to make the kind of improvements that you're looking for to help us achieve our A20 goals.

I'm a real estate broker and a manager of the Reinhardt Realtors office located at 2452 East Stadium Boulevard. I'm here to speak in opposition to the Heard Ordinance. I certainly do applaud the city's efforts to advance environmentally conscious and sustainable housing. I fear that the ordinance as currently envisioned sacrifices that goal in exchange for what is going to possibly create an unequal playing ground for the residents of the city of Ann Arbor.  In order for the ordinance to achieve its stated purpose, I believe that there are two assumptions which we need to take as true. One, that the purchaser of a piece of real estate is willing to pay a premium for a higher energy score home. And two, that that premium outweighs, is greater than the cost of pursuing those improvements that are going to be required to get that higher home energy score.  What homes are going to be able to take advantage of that playing field? Well, it's going to be the homes with higher earning income family members inside of that home. And as envisioned, the city ordinance would have a city employee operating within a city framework.  come and inspect a premises, not to give a pass-fail, as we might see on a building inspection or a building permit type inspection, but instead a valuation, a sliding scale number that is going to ostensibly add value or detract value from a particular piece of real estate.  So I have that baseline concern. Beyond that, I would call the council's attention to section 8604 of the ordinance which discusses several types of real estate which would not be subject to the ordinance, namely 8604.1. It's difficult for me to understand what this section is talking about. I cannot tell if it is related to the sale of one building  containing multiple units, or if it is related to the sale of a single unit, which is in a building configuration that would be stacked vertically. If it is that latter situation, it would create some incongruous results in certain neighborhoods. Take the Ashley Mews condominium development, for example. That's a condominium development that contains units which are both stacked vertically and adjoining laterally in a townhome configuration.  Under the current ordinance, to me, it would seem that some of those unit owners would be obligated to comply, whereas others wouldn't, despite their same relative voice in that condominium association and ownership rights within their units. Also, with respect to 8604-4, it broadly accepts commercial buildings. I don't see commercial buildings defined anywhere.  within the ordinance or elsewhere in the city code that is being pointed to. And then 86045 broadly exempts the same categories of real estate that would be exempt from the Michigan Sellers Disclosure Act. I'm not sure why that would exist. If we're going to have an independent third party come in and assess the property, the Michigan Sellers Disclosure Act relates to disclosures that would be required based on the personal knowledge of a seller. If we're not involving the seller in making this disclosure, I'm not sure why that's in there.
