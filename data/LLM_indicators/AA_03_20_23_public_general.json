I favor asking our city to explore moving away from DTE as a supplier of fossil gas and toward alternative suppliers that will partner with Ann Arbor as the city steadily moves towards phasing out fossil fuels and moves towards carbon neutrality by 2030.  I'm a professor at University of Michigan Medical School, speaking on my own accord, but also as a volunteer for Michigan Clinicians for Climate Action.  My scientific training provides a foundation for understanding the effects of climate change on our world, and my medical training provides a foundation for understanding the health risks. To quote leading climate scientist Catherine Hayhoe, the difference between a higher versus lower emissions future is nothing less than the survival of our civilization.  I am most concerned about the following problems caused by climate change. Increasing direct heat deaths, extreme weather events causing flooding in Detroit and elsewhere, the unusual occurrence of three major hurricanes in the U.S. in the past year, widespread drought such as that affecting the western U.S., unprecedented loss of species, and threats to our agriculture and food supply.  As a physician, I'm concerned about the ongoing and severe health consequences of air pollution at present, also of mosquito-borne illnesses such as West Nile virus at present, and the threat of malaria returning to the U.S. in the future. In recent years, we have learned that the burning of fossil gas is a worse problem than previously known.  One reason is that it's drilling, fracking, transportation, and use in our homes releases substantial amounts of unburned methane, the main component of gas, which is even stronger than CO2 and causing climate change. Also, recent research shows a number of direct adverse health effects from gas leaked in our homes. DTE is far behind other energy companies in Michigan and elsewhere in moving towards sustainable sources of energy.  DTE appears to be paying little attention to the future of our climate or the health of our citizens. If this resolution passes, I urge city officials to explore the following. Is it true that DTE uses large amounts of rate payer dollars for campaign donations and for lobbying against sustainable energy?  Is it true that DTE uses my money to support their greenwashing commercials on TV, which ignore their foot dragging with sustainable energy?  And finally, is it true that four months ago DTE requested that the Michigan Public Service Commission approve large rate increases to protect high pay for its executives and high return to its shareholders? High pay and high returns to shareholders seem inappropriate for a company like DTE that fights to preserve generation of dirty energy using 20th century technology.

No city council ever fought harder or longer to keep killing Palestinians.  Isn't it strange that the city council member that took all that campaign money from old friends of the Israel Defense Forces just had to run out of the room? For 20 years, you have forcefully halted every resolution that objected to US military aid pouring into Israel. 20 years.  Your main weapon is to keep the word anti-Semitism on speed dial and wield it as a weapon to protect the apartheid state of Israel. You are exactly like a Klansman shedding crocodile tears over anti-white racism while lynching your way across black America.  There is nothing lower than a corrupted governmental body like you, corrupted by your 20 years of treating, 20 years of treating the Palestinian people like insects to be banished from your site. That's how you treat them.  In this foul atmosphere of genocidal racism, you sent the police to clear out your chambers here when they were packed with Palestinian protesters and your friends.  You ignored thousands who petitioned you, thousands who marched outside this building for an end to aid to Israel. You are even unmoved by Israel's long, intimate military alliance with apartheid South Africa. With apartheid South Africa, for God's sake, even that doesn't move you.  No U.S. City Council, none, can match your record, your bloody record, of racism against a Palestinian people. Ha, the mayor can't even make eye contact. Asshole. 20 inhuman years of refusing to even vote on a simple resolution like this. We are against military aid to Israel. Simple.  You fiercely punished your own Ann Arbor Human Rights Commission when it dared to propose such a resolution to you. Meanwhile, loaded with your tax money and guarded by your mayor's gavel, Israel continues shooting and bombing its way across the Middle East. Across the Middle East."}, {"start": 1968.777, "speaker": "SPEAKER_28", "text": "Hello Ann Arbor. I'm here to still demand that this city council passes a resolution and speaks up against the slaughter of Palestinian people. I have been coming here for 20 years and I will continue to come until I see the state of Israel go out of business.  And members who are sitting here are very well aware of the genocide that's happening to Palestinian people. I know that because I spent a few minutes talking to here, Ms. America, Ms. Erica, Erica.  Briggs, and she told me that she's all aware. Everything I said to her, I said, children are being killed. And she said, I know that. I said, every time you just carelessly go to work without paying any attention to the lives of people you impact, children are dying. Children that I care about, children that I know and I want to protect. And to all of that, she responded, I know.  Therefore, if she knows, I'm sure the rest of you know, and if you didn't know, you must be receiving all my emails and all my links so you know there is a genocide happening in Palestine with the money that this country, United States of America, provides for a racist Nazi state like Israel. You must very well be aware of all of this.  There is a human rights commission in this town, and I was very excited when I first arrived here to know that such thing exists. What I didn't realize is that it could easily be cleaned up by Zionists in this town and be promoted to something basically less than a jello popsicle. And now we have people right here, Ms.  who is on the Human Rights Commission, yet she knows nothing about the history of the Human Rights Commission, and she knows nothing about Palestinian struggle, and she could care less about it. And this woman has been handpicked to sit there because of these two qualities. She has no knowledge, and she couldn't care less about Palestinian people.  The one topic in the world today is the Palestinian human rights. People who care about human rights in the world, the first issue is human rights of the Palestinian. Yet this lady here doesn't give a rat's ass about it, and she does not hide it. So I am here to say,  The reason why you guys have no energy and you left, and I can see that our mayor has gotten much older and much weaker, and his voice is unconvincing, even when he's giving awards away. He is falling asleep. It's because your conscious is heavy with burden. And it should be, because you are acting like inhumane beast. It is easy to say we are against giving fucking,  bullets and bombs to murderers. It's easy to say that, yet you don't say it. It weighs heavy on you.

As a 30-year real estate professional, including experience as a developer, with your zonings in multiple communities, I want to speak about the latest in a pattern of problematic zoning actions noticed by experts in planning and zoning over the past several years.  The application for 415 West Washington clearly does not meet the intent of multiple laws and policies. Our policies do not intend for development such as this, at this location, which is in a historic district and almost entirely in a floodplain. The proposal is for a PUD based on D2 zoning baseline characteristics. D2 permits a maximum height of 60 feet tall, with 70 feet achievable with a premium.  However, the UDC states, quote, premium options may be applied only to lots that are located entirely out of a historic district and that contain no part of a floodplain. The D2 premium is clearly not to be used at this location. The proposal instead uses a planned development to achieve this very same thing, 70 feet instead of 60 feet, linked to a similar affordable housing premium.  Yet the UDC says that a PUD quote, shall not be allowed where it's sought primarily to avoid the imposition of standards and requirements of other zoning classifications or other city regulations. There's a more recently added premium that allows 30% additional height in exchange for affordable housing or sustainability. The applicant is basing its justification on this newer premium.  that replaced planned projects after the Lower Town lawsuit demonstrated that planned project section of the UDC was not in compliance with the Michigan Zoning Enabling Act. This newer premium makes no mention of historic districts nor floodplains. Since the intent is very clear in the first premium ordinance language, these two sections are thus in conflict.  The UDC speaks to that. Quote, where conditions, standards, or requirements imposed by any provisions of this chapter are either more restrictive or less restrictive than comparable standards imposed by any other law, ordinance, or regulation, the provisions that are more restrictive or that impose higher standards or requirements shall govern. So we are left with the intent of the UDC to not exceed the standard D2 height maximum of 60 feet in a historic district or in a floodplain which both  apply to this location. Additionally, the historic district guidelines have not been followed. They state that new buildings are to be designed to be compatible with surrounding buildings that contribute to the overall character of the historic district in terms of height, form, size, scale, massing proportions, and roof shape. This has not been designed to be compatible with the contributing structures in the historic district.  Please reject this application and send it back to follow our laws and policies. Thank you very much."}, {"start": 2387.426, "speaker": "SPEAKER_22", "text": "Hello, my name is Rita Ross and I represent the 174 property owners of Earhart Village Homes as its president. We oppose the Earhart Road 2023 project. Although we were promised meetings with our city council members and the project engineers, they have not occurred. We want to know why you would accept a design that diminishes the level of service  As reported in a memo dated February 15th, 2019 from Grace Crow and Cynthia Redinger to Nick Hutchinson. Where's the data to justify spending taxpayer money on projects that reduce the level of service? Also the city's uniform development code stipulates that proposals contributing to a level of service of D, E, or F can be denied by city council. Why should the same stipulation not only apply to existing roads when implementing road diets?  We believe there is room to consider more than one design scenario, as was done for the Gettys Road Improvement Project. The city collaborated with private property owners and made adjustments which resulted in fewer trees destroyed, a shared use path, and bike lanes. Since Earhart Road currently has four lanes and the proposal reduces the road to two lanes, there is sufficient room for other design scenarios. As proposed, the city will paint Chevron lines over excess road surface.  Let's move the driving lane closer to the median and use the excess road for a bike lane and a walking path or a larger shared path. Constructing a sidewalk outside of the existing road will increase the overall width of the corridor. Keeping intact the existing property line and mature trees creates a narrow road visual, a known factor in reducing auto speeds. Additionally, the Route 3 bus stop at the corner of Earhart and Gettys is located just west of Earhart Road.  So most using the stop would have used the existing western sidewalk. All of the schools, churches, and other tributary streets to King Elementary Schools are on or connect to the western sidewalk. All residents living on the eastern side must cross Terre Heart Road at some point to reach those destinations. They will use the closest crosswalk to get on the west side of the street. The goal should be reducing overall road speed and on creating adequate and properly designed crosswalk  rather than creating a sidewalk to nowhere with gaps that will remain into perpetuity, like in front of Oxford Cemetery and Pineberry Street.

I'm calling from Ward 5 to speak about the rezoning of 415 West Washington, which has been  recommended by the planning department. 415 West Washington is a difficult site to develop, especially for residential use. That is because most of the site is in the floodplain. One of the highest authorities on building in the floodplain is the National Flood Insurance Program. And they are quoted in our own city website as recommending that, quote, residential uses in the floodplain be discouraged, end quote.  That, to me, is a very clear recommendation. Don't build residential in the floodplain. Locally, we have Jerry Hancock, our stormwater and floodplain programs coordinator. In his memo to the planning department dated February 6th of this year, he says, quote, for the past 19 years, the policy direction the city has taken for floodplain mitigation  through the various hazard mitigation plans has been to look for opportunities to purchase property, demolish structures, and lower the intensity of use in the floodplain. The concept plan to sell 415 Washington, this city-owned parcel, works at cross purposes to the city's floodplain mitigation efforts,\" end quote. But Mr. Hancock's memo does not  mentioned the toxins in the 415 West Washington site. Lucky for us, Rita La Caruso, Professor Emerita U of M, addresses the toxins in her March 17 letter to our mayor and city council. Her letter reminds us of two things. First, that both the benzene and the TCE found at the 415 Washington site are known carcinogens. Second, her letter reminds us that, quote,  Because of flooding risk, the possibility that flood water will carry pollutants beyond the site requires careful, knowledgeable analysis,\" end quote. The kind of analysis that personally I would trust only experts to do. So I urge the mayor and city council to heed the words of three experts, the National Flood Insurance Program, Sherry Hancock,  and Rita LaCaruso and send this plan back to the Planning Commission. It needs more experts to take a look at it. Thank you so much."}, {"start": 2809.878, "speaker": "SPEAKER_21", "text": "Good evening. My name is Muffy McKenzie and I live at 217 3rd Street. As a nearby resident to 415 West Washington, I have many concerns about the city's plans to move forward to build on this site.  Several of them have been mentioned, the historic district, the concerns about the floodplain. But my number one concern are the toxins and the plume on the site and spreading. These toxins are a hazard to everyone. These toxins should be cleaned up now, urgently. This is a city-owned property. The city and the county are responsible for the cleanup.  This responsibility should not depend on or wait on an unknown developer who may or may not purchase the site. Who knows how long that process could take? This is very urgent for the health and well-being of our entire community. We have been asking for several months, what is the estimated cost for the cleanup? Does the cost differ for use, if it's a park,  for residential or commercial uses? I was just recently told by my city council people that the cost is between one and three million, but for what use? Where is the data on this? How can the city make an informed decision with public support without the actual cost revealed? Whatever the cost, the city and the county need to find the money to clean this site up now.  We have a lot of bright minds in this city who could find ways, other than waiting, on a might-be developer. Don't wait. Please, don't shift the city's responsibility to clean the site up.

I did want to comment on this, and so I appreciate the mayor's getting that straightened out and allowing this comment. This may seem like a small point to many of you, but I think that these types of claims  and the way their process does provide an important window that council can look in on staff and see how the staff is interacting with the public. And for that reason, I don't think you should change the current process. Ms. Briggs' proposed change to ask for a reporting on it is a partial solution.  But it doesn't really solve the problem of really eliminating your watching staff interact with residents. And I sent you a detailed email a couple of weeks ago when this came up the first time, first reading. And I won't go into the detail of that. But the gist of it was that I had what I thought was a totally merited small sewer claim.  It was initially denied. The person I talked to about that denial letter said, well, the city staff said they didn't cause your sewer backup, so therefore we denied the appeal. I went to an appeal hearing. I'm a retired lawyer. I went there. I had an expert witness from Dynamic Drain who cleared the backup in the drain. They said it was inconceivable that any other, there was no other possibility  other than the repair of the water main break in front of my house as to what caused that. The city attorney, a young lawyer whose name escapes me now, was pretty assertive and pretty aggressive, I would say, in saying, look, you can't prove that. I reminded him of the first year torts case, Paul's graph, which for you non-lawyers says, you know, if there's a giant explosion, you can assume it came from,  a particular train engine if it blew up the train. And that principle means you don't have to prove the details of something like that. And the appeal was denied again. And this was a little disconcerting. I don't think anybody without a law degree would have maybe gotten that far. And I had essentially threatened to go to court for small claims over it in order to get anything. I got another denial letter. And then it was with a settlement offer  $950 on an $1,100 claim. I took that, I had to dice with Abby Elias for several months about the settlement agreement because it was clearly an appropriate settlement agreement. I finally got paid almost a year later. I don't think that that was an appropriate way to deal with a pretty simple claim of a taxpayer.  I'm not saying current staff would have done that or the lawyer's office would have done that, but you would never, you're never going to know how these claims are being handled unless you actually watch them. That's all I have. I don't want it to sound like sour grapes. That's really not the point. The point is that it's a window into how staff interacts with the public, and that's very important, and I don't think you should eliminate that opportunity.
