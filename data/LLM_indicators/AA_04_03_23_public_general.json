I don't have to tell you, you know it, I'm sure you do, that this city council does not work for the public. They work very carefully and very, very long time for those who contribute to their campaigns.  The mayor sitting here right now last year got $90,000 in campaign contributions. His buddies sitting here and giggling all the time, they got $30,000, $40,000 in campaign contributions. You can be sure those who gave them hundreds and thousands of dollars in campaign contributions are not gonna sit and watch as they do stuff to benefit us. They want stuff in return.  Now, I tell you they don't work for us and they work for the rich in this town because Gilman is scot-free, has paid very little for the contamination, massive contamination of our waters. I tell you they work for the rich and not for us when we know for 20 years they've been talking about  housing and shortage of housing, still we don't have affordable housing, yet the developers are fat and nice. I tell you they work for the rich and not for us because after I made a big stink about $15 minimum wage during the past election time,  and discussions. And after this Miss America here, Dharma, agreed that we need $15 minimum wage. They still haven't installed it in Ann Arbor. Workers in Ann Arbor don't have $15 minimum wage. So they don't work for us. They work for the rich. We know that. This is still a limping liberal democracy. We can kick them out.  This is still a limping liberal democracy. We can kick them out. I invite you to come and kick them out next election cycle. Their human rights record is even more atrocious. They've got a lady here who cares little, if any, for Palestinian human rights. She has even less understanding of human rights commission in Ann Arbor. She's sitting there and, you know, saying yes to Mr. Mayor.  Yesterday, Mohammad Khaled Salabi was murdered in Palestine. He was 26 years old and he had just graduated from medical school. Imagine if a medical student right here in Ann Arbor was murdered by the police.  Israelis are murdering Palestinians on a daily basis. Now it's Ramadan and the festivities brings people to Al-Aqsa Mosque. And they find every opportunity to torture people, stop their access to medical care, and shoot them dead.  All I've been asking this esteemed group here is to say that they are against military aid to Israel. Yet they don't have the decency to do that. Kick them out. This is still not a dictatorship. And this mayor doesn't work for us. I have zero respect for him and his buddies."}, {"start": 846.443, "speaker": "SPEAKER_09", "text": "In case anyone is wondering, why are we demanding a resolution against military aid to Israel? Here's why. Israel massacred thousands of Palestinian and Lebanese people and stole their land. Also, Israel sets the tone for how the United States treats Arabs and Muslims with mass murder. With mass murder, that's how.  So that brings us to Ann Arbor City Council, which loves to pass resolutions on global stuff, like a global warming, like animal rights, like goldfish rights, like the rights of deer. Look at your mayor, a big loud mouth for white Ukrainians. But never, never will you see him stand up for Palestinian rights. He has no heart.  Ann Arbor City Council has thrown its weight against every resolution for Palestinian rights for almost 40 years, since January 1984. Has this city council and this mayor ever looked at Palestinians as human beings? Ever? You tell me. As if there are rules for when you get to speak up for Palestinian human rights.  And the rule is never ever. The city council members sure seem to act like the rule is never ever. But 90 campus resolutions have broken that gag rule. Those resolutions insist on Palestinian human rights.  Amnesty International says Israel is committing the crime of apartheid against the Palestinian people. Human Rights Watch says so, too. Black Lives Matter says so, too. South Africa says so, too. And what the hell do you say? Not a goddamn thing. While Israel butchers the Palestinian people, you can't even make eye contact.  Israel is apartheid's last stand. So why is Ann Arbor City Council helping Israel to reload? To reload? Israel is so drunk with American guns and money that one of its highest officials has just said there is no such thing as the Palestinian people. And you say nothing.  Malcolm X said, stop talking about the South, as long as you're South of the Canadian border, you're South. Well, guess what? When it comes to Palestinian rights, the Ann Arbor City Council is way South, South even of the Ku Klux Klan. Ann Arbor City Council, your racist ship is sinking fast.  And I say, fuck you. Go down with that ship. Ann Arbor and the world will be better off after the voters throw you out. After the voters throw you out."}, {"start": 1261.324, "speaker": "SPEAKER_14", "text": "My name is Glen Nelson. I am one of the co-leaders of Citizens for Mental Health and Public Safety. I urge you to allocate the city's revenue from the county mental health and public safety millage to the unarmed response program.  The appropriation for millage funds of about $2.8 million per year would be in addition to the American Rescue Plan Act funding of $3.5 million. I will give two of the many reasons this would be good policy. First, the expansion of unarmed response will be another step forward in improving the quality of life in Ann Arbor.  Everyone benefits from living in a community where all people feel that others care for them. In the words of Martin Luther King Jr., quote, our goal is to create a beloved community, end quote. A beloved community is especially important to those who live with a serious mental health issue, those in poverty, and those bearing the brunt of racial, ethnic discrimination.  Second, the use of the millage funds for unarmed response would increase the chances the millage will be renewed. Many, and perhaps most, people believe a millage labeled mental health and public safety on the ballot should be spent on mental health and public safety services. The pressing need for better services in these areas reinforces their view.  The millage will expire after 2025, if not renewed or replaced. The replacement will probably be on the ballot in 2024. Now is the time for city policymakers to demonstrate that future tax revenues would be used for mental health and public safety services. Thank you for this opportunity to present my views."}], "public_hearings_1": [{"start": 4049.822, "speaker": "SPEAKER_26", "text": "Yeah, hi. Brandon Dimcheff. I live in the fourth ward.  I think this is a great project overall. I hope one day we will be able to get away with doing less parking than this, but I don't think that there's much of a concern there. People who want to have three cars and an RV aren't going to live in this building. People self-collect for the type of housing that they need.  My wife and I went down to one car recently. It's been great, saved a lot of money. I put snow tires on my bike this winter and rode all winter. And there are a lot of people who are interested in living that sort of lifestyle. This gives them a great opportunity to do so. So I hope that you approve it tonight. Thanks."}]}
