So, as I was saying, I understand why you  might want to dissolve the Brownfield Plans Review Committee tonight on the basis of efficiency and a streamlined process. And I agree with that general aim. Right now developers pass through a convoluted review process that's inflexible and needs fixing. But the Brownfield Committee is not part of the problem. And as I was saying, I checked and over the last ten years the committee has met exactly twelve times. Barely once a year on average. Sometimes some years not at all. This is not a burden.  Brownfield plan oversight is critical, not so much the site remediation activities. These are vetted by technical experts, but the non-environmental activities need close scrutiny. Here the city is using the Brownfield plan not to clean up a site, but rather to advance other goals.  It's sometimes appropriate to reward developers with a brownfield tax credit for doing something non-environmental that benefits the public. But this is tricky. There is no clear line between a useful tax trade-off and a taxpayer giveaway to the developer. We need to be mindful of bad policy, overpaying, and favoritism. Staff negotiates these deals out of public view so they require sunlight.  And once adopted, TIF tax credits are invisible. They don't show up in property tax bills, on millages, or in the city budget. The affected government entities, city, county, school board, district library, and mental health, often don't even know that they're missing the millage revenue, which can run into the millions just for non-environmental. The city is effectively deciding for all these entities. That's another reason for strict oversight.  So these plans, especially the non-environmental elements, need careful scrutiny on the front end. That's why council voted unanimously in April 2003 to establish the review committee. Please keep it intact. This is a very capable city council. But you simply do not have the time or the bandwidth at your meetings to fully vet these complex and opaque plans.  You may argue that the city's brownfield policy, adopted in 2019, reduces the need for review. In fact, it adds a layer of complexity that makes separate review even more important. By dissolving the committee, you are also eliminating one of two chances for public comment. In conclusion, this committee poses no burden  and provides needed oversight for the discretionary removal of millions in taxpayer dollars from the tax rolls for non-environmental purposes. Please do not dissolve it tonight. Thank you for considering my comments."}, {"start": 602, "end": 606, "speaker": "SPEAKER_19", "text": "Thank you.

I was enlightened by Ken Garber's description of the Brownfield Plan Review Committee's infrequent meetings. I think I've been to two of those 12 meetings over the span of the last 10 years. I remember waiting a long time for minutes for some of them.  One of the things that I think he brought up and I'll repeat is just the relatively light administrative burden for this committee relative to the relatively large sums being expended on brownfield remediation and the tax dollars that go with that.  A couple hours a year of oversight and a couple hours a year of listening to public commentary on these sorts of efforts seems like a good investment.  The challenge with brownfields is that as a city we tend to forget what came before us. We forget that there was a chemist living at and doing his chemical experiments at what is now the Science Center. We forget where all of the landfills and dumps were. We just forget. People from a hundred years ago are not around now to tell us.  where not to go. And so we're rediscovering or discovering, or like some people know of course, but most people don't, just how expensive it is to take land that we've destroyed and bring it back up to a space where it can be reused. And I think just for the public stewardship of the land that's under the city's orbit, I think it's a good idea to keep this  keep this function visible. I did look for other organizations that also have brownfield oversight, and I did find the county, which does a pretty credible job of meeting on a regular basis and reporting on, on a regular basis, their efforts. An equivalent web search of the city website was not as anywhere near as useful. So I guess the request is if you're  If you're going to decide to remove the review committee, my ask would be please put a mandate to report out on brownfield activities on perhaps an annual basis to describe the locations under use and the funds expended or not collected and make sure that people can keep tabs on bad decisions of the past and hopefully remediate it in the future.

I think they were well thought out.  I just want to say this, the committee currently has the task of reviewing multi-million dollar brownfield TIF plans, one to a year. One of the policy standards previously set is that a developer asking for TIF dollars for non-environmental items has to give a percentage to affordable housing. The committee recently, including some new members,  Matt overrode a staff recommendation of denial on the village project because the developer didn't propose any housing dollars in return for the non-environmental items, and then recommended dissolving itself. I understand that Council Member Song said a while back, essentially, don't worry about this. The county also has to approve and does its own due diligence, so there's other regulatory bodies here. The county just recently met,  On the same village project, several commissioners said, essentially, we should defer the city. So it appears that's really not a viable solution. It's our oversight, the city's oversight, that is going to essentially be potentially rubber-stamped by the county. And the commissioners essentially said that. And so did the person in charge of that for the county. These are big dollar projects. This is big affordable housing dollars.  I think shirking responsibility to carefully review these plans is a mistake. Next topic, the Brooks Street construction. The first issue, the bid process. There have been some past discussions, some heated, of the best value policy. There were often memos describing the bid amounts along with the differences in contract to practice.  To be transparent, we should be able to see the additional amounts we're paying over the low bid and what we're presumably getting for those extra dollars. But all the contracts on today's agenda, at least as far as I could tell, don't have that information. They just have the raw scores. That's a pretty good way to prevent any critiques of the bid process. You can't see the additional dollars and you have to guess what the perceived value was.  On several recent contracts, the deciding factor was worker development. What was that? An apprenticeship program maybe? Better training? Isn't the public entitled to have some idea of what we're actually getting for the extra dollars? As to the project itself, I live a block away. I just hope that the promise will be kept is that there will be some curb bump-outs to save some of the dozens of mature trees which are in the past for both sidewalks.  I walk that street regularly and with no safety concerns and I'll be sad if all the trees are cut down to say nothing of the last climate benefits of having it.

I'd like to respond to the rather personal comments I received from council members when I spoke here on April 17th.  I do not wish to respond in kind. Rather, I come before you tonight with understanding. I've spoken about the Holocaust at least a dozen times prior to this evening. No council member, past or present, has corrected any of the claims made during those 12 appearances. How do most people, myself included,  come to understand this historical event. I offer Casablanca, Sophie's Choice, and Schindler's List. I also offer the Holocaust museums we have locally and nationally, and the constant reminders the press reiterates again and again. My friend refers to this as the mighty Wurlitzer, spinning the same songs over and over.  In other words, we have been coaxed, not logically convinced into our knowledge, in quotes. And as they say, you cannot argue a person out of a position they didn't argue themselves into. When people are presented with facts that run counter to what they assume they know, a great cognitive dissonance sets in.  Have two choices, either consider what is being said to have possibilities of being true, or assault the character of the person saying them. It's human nature, not necessarily mean spiritedness. Consider the first choice, I'm sure you all have. What happens if one of you says publicly that there might be some merit in Henry's words?  Words to date that have not been challenged. Do you really think you'll win re-election? Look what happened to Ali Ramlawi after he accepted a small donation from me. He's no longer here. What if one of you votes to suspend military aid to Israel? I think we all know the answer. Reasonable people can disagree.  using reason and not emotions.

I'm going to tie my tongue and not respond to that last speaker.  Hi council, I am one of the many in our community who knew Jude Walton and counted on her to be community engaged, honest, forthright, generous and solutions oriented and compassionate.  In that spirit, I'm here to ask you to create a city task force on gender-based violence. There is no denying that Jude's murder was the result of gender-based violence. There is no denying that our city has failed to seriously address this pervasive problem. It is long past time to take action.  Sexual assault is the only crime, violent, or property in which our city has a higher incidence rate per capita than the rest of Michigan and the country at large. That rate has increased over the last 10 years. 43% of U.S. women experience some form of sexual violence. One in three U.S. women experience some form of physical violence. That's over 20,000 women each impacted in this city.  Black, indigenous, people of color, transgender, non-binary, and lower-income citizens experience higher rates of gender-based violence along with increased severity, duration, and fatality.  Prior incidents of gender-based violence is the single greatest predictor of mass shootings. 63% of all mass shooters have histories of gender-based violence. Aggression towards women, including stalking, harassment, as well as physical violence, is predictive of other violent crime.  I understand that domestic violence victim services are provided by outside agencies, usually at the county level. I am not calling for duplicating those services, I am asking for prevention. A city resident who feels unsafe calls city emergency responders. Jude once called the police department for aid when an ex was refusing to leave her home. They wouldn't intervene until a man with influence in the city called and demanded action on her behalf.  Over 10 years ago, I remember Jude complained about people using her backyard as a shortcut to West Park from Delanus and downtown. When she and neighbors applied for a fence permit, they were denied because their homes were in a floodplain. Her murderer accessed her home from the rear and was staying at Delanus. Please take a moment to let that sink in. Those are just two stories from Jude's experience. There are more which signal opportunities  lost to increase her safety as a single woman living alone. And there are so many more citizens with story of gender-based violence and harassment to tell. Each of those stories could lead to an action at the city governance level that would show we as a city are willing to step up to the challenge of responding adequately to the risk posed to vulnerable citizens.  The research is abundant. The funding for this work at the state and federal level is abundant. We have a community capacity and expertise. We have gender-based violence programs at every level of government except in this city. Thank you. Do we have the will? What would you do in your place? Please honor her legacy by seriously considering this request.

Ann Arbor will stop permitting investments in toxic and climate disrupting gas infrastructure. No vote, or not even bringing a vote before us,  is a no vote. It's a no vote on climate action that we absolutely urgently require. We're in a declared climate emergency. We have an A20 goal of powering our grid with 100% renewables by 2030. There is no possible way that we can even approximate this goal unless we stop permitting investment in fossil fuel infrastructure right here in Ann Arbor.  We need to electrify everything and power it with renewables and efficiency. We at Washtenaw 350 have a motto. When you're in a hole, first stop digging. Gas infrastructure is a huge, gaping hole, perhaps the largest that we here can control. We need to cut that off immediately.  Today I just read that in a part of southern France there are three communes that have no water. That's 3,000 people who have no water. There are forest fires raging in those areas that don't normally even start until maybe July or August. And they've cut off water for everything except for hygiene and emergency medical use. No agriculture. That's today.  The Energy, Environmental, and Renters Commissions have all passed resolutions calling for no new gas infrastructure for new and substantially remodeled buildings. Please schedule and vote yes on a gas ban. You, as council members, are the only ones who have the ability to make this policy a reality. Please.

I'm here to speak in favor of the unarmed crisis response and wellness check proposal with a personal story, a story of mental health. My wife and I married in 2018 and enjoyed two years as newlyweds, then COVID hit. In quarantine and also working from home, we spent 24 hours a day and seven days a week together for years.  Through counseling, we also learned that both my wife and I suffer from severe childhood trauma. For everyone in this room who has had a relationship or is in a relationship, I think can respect the fireworks that that recipe just cooked up. In the fall of last year, an argument rose to crisis level. For the first time, I was scared.  It was late on a Sunday evening when neither one of us could reach our counselors. I felt so over my head I called 911. A friend had recently told me about unarmed crisis wellness checks. I asked the dispatcher, please send an unarmed response team for a wellness check. 30 minutes later, three police cars arrived. We both cooperated, but I believed I was asked leading questions while in a vulnerable state for the purpose of making an arrest.  I don't fault the police. They were extremely compassionate and helpful. But because my wife had self-harmed and because I had a small cut and a bruise, my wife was arrested. But this is not a story with a sad ending. My wife and I got the counseling, we're in a great place together, and we're overcoming a lifetime of childhood trauma together. We've learned to support each other and are in a functioning and healthy marriage.  Spending the night in jail was extremely traumatic for my wife. It was also costly. Legal fees, logistics, hotel rooms, court costs put expenses over $10,000. But I can never erase the vision of my wife being walked to a patrol car in handcuffs, especially when I feel unarmed mental support was all I was calling for.  Although the case was dismissed, my wife still has an arrest on her record and I now fear for her citizenship. I loved reading the report.  On the unarmed crisis support team's status, last year it looked like money from the Federal American Rescue Plan Act was directed to the program. And according to a group called the Coalition for Revisioning Our Safety in Washtenaw County, that funding would allow the program to operate for the first year. Could that be the beginning?

Now, I'm an entrepreneur, I'm a capitalist, I believe in capitalism, but I believe in regulated capitalism. I don't want the Wild West in capitalism, and I don't want the Wild West in government. Government has a role to play. As one of the speakers said, you are our representatives. Whenever you reduce the amount of oversight, public scrutiny, public hearings,  public information as provided. It reduces that window of the public, of the people you represent, of the citizens of Ann Arbor, into how our government works. This particular item has to do with a lot of money and a relatively infrequent amount of time that society needs to meet.  But it's very important. The whole function of the Southfield TIF aspect of cleaning up sites, especially orphan sites, is very valuable to get sites cleaned up that otherwise might not. But a lot of money changes hands. A lot of money, tax dollars, are involved. Public scrutiny should be not just allowed, but embraced.  Journalism is reduced these days, we all know that. Therefore, we need more public scrutiny, not less public scrutiny, whenever we have the opportunity. I believe dissolving this committee reduces the public scrutiny, reduces your helping us to have a window into how government works and how government deals with our tax dollars.

I want to say that last Monday, Councilmember Radina and I, Senators Schenck, Irwin, and Somerville, as well as Commissioner Robby,  toured the city's materials resource facility, our sorting facility, where our recycling is processed. It's remarkably clean. It's well organized. It has enormous blocks of tin, aluminum, plastic bottles, all of these things that go to commodity markets. But we also saw a few blocks of plastic film.  These blocks contained giant dog food bags and other forms of containers that cannot be recycled. We want to redouble our commitment to get these out of our waste stream.  Maybe some of you participated in a pilot that we had a couple of years ago, and that remains in place at El Jarrisa, among other places, where you get your takeout food in a container that you can bring back. They will clean it and give it to you again. Perhaps not in that very minute, but know that it remains in circulation.  And they would like your feedback to help them figure out how to do that. So look for a series of interactive community workshops from May 22nd to 25th. I will provide more details when I hear them. And I also received some drop-off station fee waivers. This is where you take things that you cannot curbside recycle, like styrofoam, metal items, textiles, motor oil, cooking oil. This waives the $3 entrance fee. I'm going to set them over here for you.  And I want to say finally that I celebrated Earth Day in Ward 1 at Leslie Science and Nature Center, where I enjoyed the city's water taste test.

And so I just very briefly, for those who may be tuning in and then maybe tuning out before we get to that point on the agenda,  What we are doing is going to increase public participation and transparency regarding the Brownfield review process. Instead of a small committee that meets, you know, quietly when the public isn't paying attention and, you know, receives the presentation from the developer at that point,  that part is going away, the entire body here will receive that presentation from the developer and will be able to consider the plan as a body. So that provides greater public scrutiny, it provides greater transparency, and it provides for the entire of the council to ask the questions of the developer. It also streamlines the process, yes.  Because we don't want to ask the developer to come give that presentation twice. They shouldn't need to do that That just adds extra cost to the development process and that is something that we are trying to address because we're trying to bring down those costs where possible in order to make development in our city more affordable and to open it up to more people and  who may not have access to loads of capital. So we can see some different types of developers doing projects in our community.

So I spent several hours on Friday, which appropriately was Workers Memorial Day, looking at the worker safety information included in Fonsen's proposal for CA5. What I found was highly concerning and prompted me to also review an earlier project that we approved here at the table in March with that same company.  So for both RFPs, Fonsen listed the same incomplete OSHA training information. OSHA certificates for only four employees. Three of those certificates were from 2011. Along with an email indicating that just seven more employees were signed up for training sessions in January and March.  However, in both RFPs under a different section, the section for ratio of masters to apprentices, they list more than two dozen other employees, none of whom are OSHA certified or will be according to their own proposals. So in contrast, the contractor who won second place in this bid submitted OSHA certificates for 34 of its employees.  Um so from these proposals, Fonsen admitted and revealed that they have just two laborers who will supposedly have the training by the time construction begins. The nine other employees who have the training certificates are foreman or management. It begs the question, where are the OSHA certificates for the people who will be doing the actual work? Because I know it won't be the foreman or the management.  Therefore, before I can feel comfortable approving this proposal tonight, I'm going to propose an amendment that makes it crystal clear to Fonsen and to everyone else that we mean it when we say in our RFPs and in our contracts that companies must provide evidence that all craft labor that will be employed by the bidder on city projects  has or will have prior to commencement of the project completed at least an authorized 10 hour OSHA construction safety course. So if we can circulate the amendment, this would be adding a resolved clause.  It says, resolved, the contract shall be amended to include provisions that require the contractor to provide the names of all craft laborers who will work on the project and sufficient evidence that each of them have completed the prescribed OSHA safety training requirements prior to work commencing on the project. And that failure to provide such evidence shall constitute a breach of contract."}, {"start": 3651, "end": 3656, "speaker": "SPEAKER_19", "text": "Is there a second? Seconded by Kathy Ackman.

I don't think I, I mean, I know I didn't ever vote for a water or stormwater increase in my four years on council. And Mr. Mayor has been here since 2014. And along with all the other changes we've seen in our community since 2014, this will put us on track.  to have a doubling of our water rates and our storm water rates by the end of the next fiscal year. So I don't know how many of you do any kind of investment or have ever heard of the rule of 72, but when you go 6, 7% every year, 10 years, you're doubled. And that's where we're at. Now, we're not producing twice as much water. We're still doing up to 19 million some gallons a day. The cost for producing that water hasn't doubled in those 10 years.  Inflation isn't running at 7%, although under the current local state and federal Democratic administrations, it certainly is pushing it this year. So why is it that we're doubling folks' water rates in less than a decade? And is there any consideration that  these constant increases in fees, fees for services and so on, that seem constant and unstoppable, aren't being considered as detrimental to our efforts to create a more affordable and equitable community. Because there's no way that you can, the city can double cost,  Add $150 million in spending to its budget, it's coming up another hearing. Double cost for water, jack up fees for every kind of service the city has to do. And say with a straight face that you're working towards equity and you care about people who live below the median income here. And I recognize that the median income here in Washtenaw County and the greater Ann Arbor area is quite high because of our relationship with the university and the fact that Ann Arbor's always been sort of a wealthy white community.  Be that as it may, there are many people in this community who struggle and I think the lineup for our assisted housing proves that. So just as you go forward with jacking up costs to live in our community, consider that there's more than one way to make it an affordable community. And one way is to not jack up costs for everybody.

So my house was built in 1947. And even when it was built, it was built, including the changes to code that have happened, zoning designations and height area and placement regulations that have changed since then. It was considered non-conforming.  And so when I went to put an addition on my house that didn't increase the footprint of my house in any way, but was only above the existing non-conforming footprint, I was asked to appeal their rejection of that plan by submitting an application for the Zoning Board of Appeals. Now when I called the person who administers that, and he said, I can tell by my GPS that you're about 13 to 16 inches off.  I'm looking at the historical records of your house and so on, and it's clear that you're in front of that. And every place I've ever known, any place I've ever worked, this is an administrative fix because we recognize that this happens constantly. And if you look at the ZBA records, and those of you who serve on the ZBA, you'll see that this happens constantly. People come with this, their house was out of, and they approve it. And that's what happened to me.  But on the way to that, I paid $1,000 fee for that application privilege. And I also was required to get a $1,400 stakes survey. They wouldn't accept the survey. And that I had, I had to get a new stakes survey. And that took quite a while to find someone during COVID to do that, but it was done. So $2,400 later, they went like that, which could have been done administratively. Now, I only bring that up as an example because I'm not sure people know that adding $2,400 to a very small project,  you know, could be a burden for someone. It could drag out a project. In my case, it certainly did. Should I pay a lawyer or ZBA or my architect, right? Well, when I look at the 36 pages of increases that you got coming here, including one that's real good for you, Jen, the airport unit  And we know she gave her buddy the airport contract for 30 years. Now they're going to jack up the rates he can charge. I think that's really extra special. But when I look at that 36 pages of fees that are going up between 7 and 40 percent, I certainly understand from being on that side of the table that we have to do a fair analysis of what our costs are. And we have to set the fees that way. But  If you took the time to read through this, you'd see that some of these fees are pretty astronomical and some of these changes are going to benefit people who can afford them and they're going to hurt people who can't.

I'm Kathleen Murphy, I live at 315 Linda Vista Street in Ward 5. I thank the council for giving us the opportunity tonight to make comments about the proposed budget. I speak for the organization, Ann Arbor for Public Power.  We are in the process of trying to create a public electric utility to replace DTE because it uses mainly fossil fuels to produce its energy and thus stands in the way of allowing Ann Arbor to reach its goal of net zero carbon emissions by 2030. It also has had terribly unreliable service this past winter.  We'd like to put a placeholder, that is, Ann Arbor for Public Power, we'd like to put a placeholder in the budget of $25,000, $250,000, which would go toward the valuation of DTE's assets if the feasibility study, which the council authorized and funded, and is expected to be completed in June, looks positive.  In other words, if the feasibility study looks positive, then the next step would be to have a more precise valuation done of DTE's assets. We anticipate, after talking with cities that have undergone the creation of public electric utilities, that this would be the cost, $250,000. Since we won't know the results of the feasibility study until June,  but the budget needs to be passed in two weeks, we're asking for a placeholder in the budget to ensure that funds are available. If the feasibility study comes out to the council's liking and they want to go ahead with the valuation study, they would have then the money to do it. This is a relatively small ask in what has come to become a very large budget.  I urge you to put this placeholder in the budget so it will be possible to follow through with this plan to establish a municipal electric utility in Ann Arbor if the feasibility study shows that the process can go forward. Thank you."}, {"start": 4947, "end": 4952, "speaker": "SPEAKER_20", "text": "Thank you."}, {"start": 4952, "end": 4954, "speaker": "SPEAKER_19", "text": "Is there anyone else in house who would like to speak at this public hearing?"}, {"start": 4960, "end": 5146, "speaker": "SPEAKER_23", "text": "Good evening, council and my fellow citizens of Ann Arbor and staff present. I am still Dr. Lauren Sargent. I still live on Ember Way in Ann Arbor and my hair is still on fire because I'm still worried about climate change. And some of you might ask, what on earth does a municipal electric utility have to do with climate change?  Well, we in Washtenaw 350 examined levers at every level where we could apply our efforts toward climate action, and we understood that we need to electrify everything and power it with renewables and efficiency. And we also concluded that the only practical usable tool is a municipal electric utility,  because right now we're stuck with DTE and they do not share our climate goals. They actively fight the just transition as the biggest lobbyist in Lansing with our money and there's nothing we can do about it short of severing that relationship.  The legislature and MPSC are de facto regulated by the investor-owned utilities, DTE, and consumers via their donations, their financial donations. Only six out of our current crop of legislators, most of them around this area, have refused to take their money. It's literally the fox guarding the hen house. And there's only one tool that can allow us to break three, free from them for electricity.  And that is legal as a municipal utility. It is legal in statute and the Michigan Constitution. And every city always has a right to its own electric franchise. Administrator DeHoney was very wise in setting aside some money in the budget for unanticipated and emergent costs.  an additional feasibility study should the original feasibility study that council already approved be positive that it looks like this would be good financial decision for the city to do it, we've got to then have the money to value the assets, to do a feasibility study to value those assets. And something that I really appreciated in hearing the budget presentation  was thinking about ways that we can put some stability and predictability into our budget. Right now, DTE gives us absolutely no control over it. One of the things that cities with municipal electric utilities enjoy is that budget stability. Holland, actually, with a nice electric municipal utility, had a problem twice within the last decade.  how to return all the extra money that they got from the revenues from customers, they had to return money because they had too much. And they also pay things to the cities in which they reside called pilot fees, payment in lieu of taxes. And also, the electric utilities borrow money for infrastructure repairs at half the rate that DTE does. It's a budget no-brainer, so please,  Save some space for step two.

He's what some people on this body, I think, like the least, which is an environmentalist who can do math.  So I found it useful to me when I read the budget every year, which I've been doing since 2012 or so, maybe even before that, to look at it in a comparative way, and also look at it in a per capita way, and also look for trends. And since I believe this is the only public hearing on the budget, which is just kind of shocking, because 2018, I had to work in the fall of 2018 with the budget that was approved before me, and 2018,  It was quite a bit smaller. I think it was 400, I wanna say 421 million, something like that. And this year it's 563, and I actually lost that bet. I thought it was gonna be 570. So that's not only is that $4,800 for every single person that lives in our community per year, it's a 442 million increase in only six years. That's quite a chunk of change.  Our mills are only going up 1.9 mills or whatever, and that's because of the various ballot initiatives that were passed.  If you look back at the 2018 thing, you can see they had placeholders in there for $627 million in alternative transportation funds, which is kind of shocking. I'm sure by the time this budget is done being itself in two years, it'll be $600 million, just the budget itself. So in 2018, we had $2.5 million in one-time requests. And this year, we have $4 million in one-time requests, $600,000. That's for studies. There's lots of funds carried forward. I thought that was kind of interesting. In this budget, the thing I see the most  We'll back it up one step. When I received my first budget cycle presentation in 2018, 2019, it was about 80 pages. And that's not the budget book, I'm talking about the presentation. And I watched yours and it was about eight. And I hate to say this, but it kind of gave me the vibe that staff's got your number.  We got 740 full-time equivalents in 2018, 840 this year. It's really something. That's where a lot of the money's going. Now there seems to be a constant quest for revenue. We're positioning ourself for long-term impact. And this constant quest for revenue fails to, two things aren't in here, one revenue and one expenditure. The one, if we're looking so hard for revenue,  How come we didn't implement the pilot program that city council said we were supposed to appoint a committee and study a pilot program and there was even anticipated amounts of revenue coming from that. But that just fell between the cracks. And the expenditure that fell between the cracks was another council resolution that passed that said there's supposed to be money in this budget for an office of the ombuds person. And that has failed to be in here too. So we have failures on both sides of this budget.

Should the feasibility study  lead you to decide to take the next step in the municipalization process. I should back up and say that I appreciate the tremendous amount of work that staff has put into this budget, especially Administrator DeHoney, but all down the line.  I think like Ms. Murphy said, this is a relatively small ask, a quarter million dollars, and not an actual allocation, simply a placeholder.  This, you may think, this strikes me as pretty affordable. And it is that way because Five Lakes is already doing much of the work in the ongoing feasibility study. Also, a lot of the infrastructure is open to visual inspection. And as a regulated utility, DTE has submitted a lot of information already to the state on asset condition and depreciation. So the system is not a black box.  As I was sitting there, I remembered something I did read in the budget documents. It's a minor point, but DTE, if I'm remembering right, is raising our street light energy rates by 14% this year, or $300,000, and an additional double-digit increase next fiscal year, FY25.  So this is more than we're asking just for this placeholder. I'm confident that a muni can deliver electricity at least as affordably as DTE and as the previous speakers have said, has the potential to acquire electricity on the wholesale market that's 100% renewable.  So I realize this is a controversial topic, but I think this is a very minor and prudent step that you can take tonight, actually not tonight, but in the next two weeks as you complete the budget, to make an allowance for this possibility.

I hope the bandshell will be repaired and re-situated so it will serve its purpose and be used for concerts in the park once again. It's a matter of honoring our city's history.  I'm surprised that the city plans to spend a lot of money to make Fuller Park into so-called Bicentennial Park. The city has said over and over that it has no money for more parks, and yet there seems to be plenty of money for this. Also, I have learned from Susan Weinberg, an Ann Arbor historian, that Fuller Park was indeed named for the Fuller family and not merely for the road.  So I feel the name should not be changed. Again, it's a matter of honoring our city's history, especially in this bicentennial year. I notice there is absolutely no money for the center of the city in the budget, although city residents mandated the center of the city when we passed Proposal A.  On the other hand, there is money for the tree line trail, which was not voted on by city residents at all. I urge you to put money in the budget to clean up the toxins at 415 West Washington Street.  This is city property, and the city has known about these taxons for years and has done nothing. And now we know that these taxons are spreading. The city wants to wait years until a developer comes forward, submits all the necessary plans and gets all the necessary approval, and only then cleans it up. We can't wait that long.  And the city would end up paying for the cleanup anyway by a waived taxes. Those are our taxes. I would hope the city would value the health of its residents, the taxpayers, and would clean it up now. Lastly, I'm sorry that the Klein lot is no longer being viewed as a site for affordable housing, but rather for market rate housing.  Quoting City Administrator Jehome, he said, quote, now, admittedly, the use of the line for market rate. 30 seconds. Affordable may get me uninvited to a Thanksgiving dinner table. Yes, indeed.

So yeah, I got I got three comments. One is the I like the idea of the the downtown safety patrols involving an empty and a.  and someone from Supportive Connections, that's a great idea. I do not like the idea of police being involved in this also. If we want these safety patrols to be going around and helping people, it's going to be hard to find people, it's going to be hard to  make people feel safe enough to be honest about the kind of help that they need if there's a police officer around. And even if the police say, oh, we're not here to arrest people or something like that when they're part of these patrols, that message will not be heard by the people on the street who they're talking to.  And so it'll definitely inhibit people finding the right kind of help.  There's point number two. I saw that this budget increases the police budget by 1.75 FTE. And I don't know if that's because of the downtown safety patrols or not. But either way, I would like for us not to be increasing the police budget. I think that we'll see when we start implementing  when we start implementing the unarmed response program, that the need for police officers will drop by quite a bit, because the unarmed response will be doing a lot of the work that police used to do. And so I'd rather see some of the money, instead of being spent on police, spent on that.  And finally, we have $1 million of unallocated budget money from marijuana taxes, and I would like to advocate for that to go towards reparations. The city has  throughout its history and up to the present, had policies that have prevented black families from building wealth, from building generational wealth. And meanwhile, white families have had opportunities to build wealth that black families have not. And that's not just some inevitable forces of history that caused that to happen. It was decisions.  that were made by the city council. And so we should take that million dollars and put it towards reparations like they do in Evanston, Illinois.

I'm calling in once again to advocate for the $250,000 budget placeholder for the valuation study of a municipal utility. As many of the other callers said, this is simply the next step in a process that the city has already begun.  If the feasibility study is positive, and it indicates that this would be a direction that would be financially beneficial for the city to pursue, then the next step in the process is to get a hard valuation on what the cost of DTE's assets would be, which would allow the city to then make an offer to DTE. It would help in any future legal fights over valuation. And it's just a prudent step in pursuing this process.  If we did not put this placeholder in the budget and then the results were positive, it would simply mean that we need to take the money from somewhere else in the budget rather than, and that would simply just be messy. It would be, it could be good. It would be poor governance. We hope that this is not a too controversial of a position to ask for. It seems like simply the,  It's a prudent thing to do, considering that we have this study coming out next month, and we don't know the results yet, but we know that the next step, if they're positive, would be to spend this money. When you look across the state of Michigan, across the country, you see that municipal utilities have cheaper rates, they have better reliability, and they have the ability to choose where their power comes from. With the city of Ann Arbor's climate goals, it is unrealistic to expect that we are going to be able to reach them,  with DTE as our primary power provider. Municipalization simply seems like the only realistic option to pursue the city's climate goals while having the added benefit of increasing its reliability and over time lowering its cost.

Bundled into this year's city budget is this year's capital improvement plan, the CIP. And one of the items included in the CIP is the extension of a runway at the Ann Arbor City Airport.  Our A20 plan boasts a goal of carbon neutrality by the year 2030 and a strategy that focuses on reducing the miles we travel in our vehicles, regardless of type, by at least 50%. Having those two goals, it is ironic that an extension of the airport runway could be considered for inclusion in the CIP. Yes, the Ann Arbor Airport has a long and interesting history.  Yes, it provides many benefits to Ann Arbor and the surrounding area, but that does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that extending a runway by 720 feet will be better for the community than the current configuration of the airport. This is because a longer runway is sure to enable use by larger jets and more jet traffic.  Here's what the mayor says in his letter of welcome on page 5 of the H2O plan. Quote, every person, every homeowner, renter, student, visitor, community member, business owner, worker, youth, and elected leader has a significant role to play in achieving community-wide carbon neutrality, end quote. When the mayor says every person, I believe that every person  must include those who travel to and from Ann Arbor by private or corporate jet. If that is not the case, if only persons of lesser financial means than jet travelers are asked to make sacrifices, then that certainly flies in the face of the admirable goals of the H-0 plan. Some have claimed that the runway should be extended for reasons of safety.  But no clear danger from the current configuration of the runways has been demonstrated. Others say they suspect that the true purpose of the proposed runway extension is to allow more and larger jets into Ann Arbor's airport at a time when we are fully aware of how highly polluting these jets are. While the extension of the runway would bring jobs, union jobs, so would the other items on the CIP.  The CIP is a list of proposed capital improvements after all. I hope City Council will consider removing the proposed Ann Arbor Airport runway extension from the CIP so that projects of much broader community benefit can be moved forward instead. Because an extended airport runway will benefit only the very wealthy.

The first one might be somewhere in here, but I didn't see the answer. Are we going to be using the climate millage to pay for any of the new sustainability FTEs? Next, how about an explanation of the statement on page 29? There it says we had 685 FTEs in 2013, 10 years ago.  to propose 829 in 2024, 144 more people. That's an increase of 21%.

This budget adds 27,  The city administrator has gone from 3 in 2021 to 5 now, to 8 next year. What are those two additional people already at it doing? What are the next three going to do? Sustainability is at a 9. GPA is 143. I don't know why the budget uses a different number other places. The Housing Commission has gone from 30 in 2021 to 43 now, 47 next year, 52 in 2025. Should people be asking what are they going to be doing?  The city administrator said we need to pay more to be competitive, so 3% up to all non-union employees. That, I think, has a point. But with all these new hires, you're talking $3 million before the salary bumps even happen. How are we going to afford all this?  Just a few extra questions from the report. The human resources goes from 2.3 million last year to 2.7 next year. Finance, 4 million in 2021 to 4.8 next year. District court, 1.2 million 2022 to 1.5 next year.

While I'm not so enthusiastic about outsourcing creativity, I think it would be desirable to be an opportunity for  people to anticipate the outcome of this feasibility and planning study is actually having a programmatic support of some sort agreeing to be matched. One aspect for the placeholder  would be some education for the city council members and the general public as to what is the commons, commonly pooled resources self-managed by the users. This is an idea that is not new. It's as old as history. And the Nobel Prize in economics, as I think I quote, was given to the research that put together thousands of studies all over the world.  as to how when public resources and commonly pooled resources, and public and private and what people give of their money and land and talent and so on, are managed by the users rather than either by the government or by some private corporation, the resources are better used. So that's why it's important to see some education for the council people and for the general public as to what is the cause.

Since the Phase I feasibility study will not be done until next month, but you're passing your budget this month, it would be easier just to create this $250,000 placeholder now and avoid scrambling for money later.  Okay, third, I'd like to say that DTE's power in my area on the west side was out for three days in the February ice storm when my house went down to 46 degrees before power was restored. It was an amazingly stressful and avoidable experience. About 80,000 Ann Arbor residents lost power in that storm, in the winter, in the bitter cold, and many for five days or more. In my view, the danger, the damage, the cost, and the stress caused by  DTE's unreliable electric service disqualifies that corporation from providing power to Ann Arbor. We require a dependable electric service, and luckily the state constitution gives us that option to have a public electric utility that completely replaces DTE.  I look forward to that. I want DTE out of here. Please create a $250,000 budget placeholder so that we can take the next step in creating a public electric utility.

Could you speak a little bit about that?

So we need to be positioned to begin or continue replacing some of that. You'll see a lot of that in the  capital plan for the next four years or so. There are about 20 water main projects, distribution projects, incorporated in the budget, which are part of what the bond issue will be used for, again, that I'll be talking about in phase one.  We anticipate typically when we put pipe in the ground that it's going to last about 100 years. So that means we should be replacing about 1% a year to stay on top of our reinvestment needs. So that is what's driving a lot of the current and future rate projections in addition to the improvements we need to make at the water plant, which was built in the 1930s and is also reaching the end portions of its life.

I will kick this off.  Mr. Sean and Mr. Ader are here to help support in case there's a question that I may not be able to answer. This bond is focused on projects that go through fiscal year 26. There's about 20 of them. They are all distribution system focused, so mostly water main projects. There's also some valve replacements in the distribution system.  It's typical and best practice for us to use bonds to pay for future capital projects needs like this. And the reason is that that's best practice is because  the benefits of these investments are realized by future water customers. And through the bonding process, as we pay the bonds back through our water rates, future customers are paying for that additional infrastructure. So that's typical in best practices and the reason why we use issuing debt to cover those types of projects.  We also have other tools in our toolbox besides just issuing our own by issuing bonds by the city, but we look at grant programs. We've been successful recently. In fact, we just recently was awarded one from the state of Michigan to help do some work with the water treatment plant.  address associated with our filters. We also use revolving and loan fund programs we've been successful in achieving or getting funds from recently from the state of Michigan. And we'll continue to pursue those types of options that will be available to us when we see projects that fit and we think will score well. The projects that we've identified for this water revenue bond  again, which are typically water main projects, typically do not score well through the state's ranking system. So we tend not to submit these types of projects for that type of funding. But when we're doing projects that have a larger benefit for the whole water system, those will score better through the state's ranking system and those we will continue to put through in order to get preferred  the preferred rates that are associated with the state's program. The bonds are, one other question that was raised by one of the council members was how the bonds paid back, and they are paid back through future waterways. I think I mentioned that already. The other portion of utilizing bonds is it helps us meet also our financial metrics with utility.  So we are looking at things like debt coverage ratios to make sure we can meet those in order to make sure we can maintain the bond ratings that we want so we can get good rates when we go to market. So we factor in these financial metrics also into the decisions on how much to bond for and when to also go out to the market to bond.  I guess the last thing I'll add, and Kate can open it up and see if there's any other questions, is that we did also just put out in our monthly newsletter, which is the Ann Arbor Water Newsletter, a description that you can share about the bond and the anticipated use and how we will fund it at the request of one of the council members also, so that can be shared with constituents."}, {"start": 7814, "end": 7832, "speaker": "SPEAKER_19", "text": "Thank you.

There are no members other than Councilmembers on it, and initially, it filled a gap.  Council established the Brownfield Plan Review Committee when agreements were negotiated project by project, which is to say that standard policy guidelines had not yet been specified. So the committee served the function of making those guidelines up as it went along.  they negotiated brownfield agreements and then sent them along to city council for approval. Since 2019, when council adopted a policy that prescribed standards guiding these brownfield tax incentive agreements, there was no longer a gap for the review committee to fill. We had actually told ourselves how to do that work. And so the review committee was essentially  part of the council being instructed by the whole council on what to do to give to the whole council to approve. You see my point. There's a little redundancy, if not a little bit of schizophrenia there. So no, I shouldn't be light about that. So anyway, the policy specifies the environmental and non-environmental activities that are and are not eligible for reimbursement.  Codified rules, such as we enacted in 2019, play an important part in oversight because they provide consistent common standards that any reviewing body and the public must use in evaluating brownfield agreements. Dissolving the review committee makes no reduction or limitation of council oversight. There is no punting or shirking of responsibility.  The review committee has never been the committee of final review. It is now and will remain the responsibility of City Council to review brownfield agreements for projects within the City of Ann Arbor and deny or approve them. Council as a body will now act, as Councilmember Iyer explained earlier, with the benefit of a presentation from the developer.  Any plan approved by City Council will proceed to the county for final approval. Nothing is being ceded to the county. The county is now and will remain in the role of the Washtenaw County Board of Commissioners to give final approval  to any brownfield plan that comes before it. And what's more, the Board of Commissioners always convenes a public hearing for every brownfield plan agreement in the county and provides notice to every taxing jurisdiction. So whether the review committee is dissolved or not, all affected jurisdictions will be noticed and will have an opportunity to evaluate and comment on every county brownfield agreement.  If we dissolve the review committee, we will eliminate one thing only, which is the inefficient use of a precious resource, and I am talking about the time and effort of our planning staff and development team."}, {"start": 8214, "end": 8362, "speaker": "SPEAKER_11", "text": "Move my microphone, I'm so fired up about this. Just to clear up some, I think, misinformation that's been shared. The Michigan Strategic Fund's Brownfield Program uses tax incremental financing to reimburse brownfield related costs that are incurred when developing contaminated, functionally obsolete, blighted, historic, or other, here's the key word, eligible properties.  By increasing the taxable value of the properties, the Brownfield program generates increased tax revenue and has a positive significant impact on the taxable values of surrounding properties. I think a couple of really important things to note is that the incentive amount is not guaranteed. It is only realized if the investment achieves the anticipated increase in property value. So the cause and effect need to match in order for that incentive to be awarded.  The developer must pay for the improvements to the site, and then property taxes must be paid each year. This is not a handout. Once the Brownfield plan reimbursement is complete, the increased property taxes that would not exist without the redevelopment taking place begin going directly to all of the taxing jurisdictions, city, county, and state.  TIF programs are really common in economic development. We have other examples of TIF tax incremental financing being used here in the city of Ann Arbor. And in every single case where TIF dollars are applied, there are very clear parameters around what a qualifying project is, clear methods to evaluate the success of a project in order for those dollars to be awarded.  This is important. There's no ambiguity when it comes to awarding TIF dollars, regardless of the program from which those dollars are granted. There's also no ambiguity around the Brownfield TIF being an important economic development tool that's not unique to Ann Arbor, Michigan, or the country.  It's really common. What isn't common is to suggest that there's something irresponsible, untoward, shortsighted, uninformed about this move by city council. Quite candidly, it feels like conspiracy theory fodder around a program that is literally designed to provide significant economic benefit to the city.  Any brownfield project that the city would take on still requires city council approval. That can't be stated more. To suggest dissolving this committee removes oversight from the process is dishonest at worst. And at best, it shows a complete and fundamental lack of knowledge around the process itself.

We received the  presentation from the developer and then we had a substantive discussion and then when it came to council it was not so substantive because that had already taken place and the recommendation came here.
