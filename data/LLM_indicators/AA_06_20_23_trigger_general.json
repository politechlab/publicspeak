We've missed you these past three years.  This year we are presenting awards for Preservation, Rehabilitation, Centennials, and Special Merit. I'd also like to thank the committee that selected the awards, Patricia Austin, Grace Shackman, Frances Wright, Tom Stahlberg, Ellen Ramsburg, and Ina Hannell-Gerdnitsch. Special thanks are owed to our incomparable staff person, Jill Thatcher.  We believe that architecture is an art form which gives beauty to the public every day as they drive, bike, or walk through town. Tonight's awardees have generously provided this beauty to us and we want to show that we appreciate their work. Thank you awardees for this beautiful gift. And the first award is for  Preservation. Preservation awards are presented in recognition of superior maintenance of a significant property to preserve its essential historical, cultural, or architectural value for a period of 10 years or more. And the first award goes to 2115 Melrose Avenue  which is up on the screen. This is to Kenneth and Penelope Fisher. This handsome Tudor revival home was built in 1929 for James Dale, an insurance salesman. It features a steeply pitched roof, prominent chimneys, randomly extruded bricks, casement windows, and an arched top front door that combine to give the house a particularly medieval vibe. It has been the home of Ken and Penny Fisher since 1988. Are they here?  No. Okay. It's hard to give awards in June. Everybody's away often. The next award goes to the Church of the Good Shepherd at 2145 Independence Boulevard.  The Church of the Good Shepherd is a mid-century modern church designed by local architect Robert Metcalf and built by Arthur Chizik in 1957. It is a beautiful example of a non-residential structure designed by Metcalf and has been wonderfully maintained by the church. Its original undulating roof was repeated in an addition that was built in 2005.  Anyone from the church?

This mid-century modern structure was the home of local architect James Livingston and built in 1958. Livingston designed many houses in this area in the 1950s. He also designed Lurie Terrace, Maynard House, Weber's Inn, Lawton School, and many houses in Washtenaw County's Thorn Oaks Historic District.  The home has been owned and beautifully maintained by Robert and Martha Ozzie since 1965. Obviously, you're here. Thank you so much. You're welcome.  Thank you for all you've done. Okay, next. Oops. The next preservation award goes to Anna Mapp and Adam Matsker for 2240 Belmont Road.  This mid-century modern home, you see a pattern here, in Ann Arbor Hills was designed by local architect George Brigham and built in 1952. It was described in an Ann Arbor News article as, quote, the pinnacle of livability and beauty, unquote.  It was built for Dr. Albert C. Furstenberg, a physician who served as dean of the UM Medical School for 25 years, and developed it into one of the foremost centers for medical research in the United States. Furstenberg Park is named after him. It has been owned by Adam Matsker and Anna Mapp since 2004. Anyone? No Mapp? No Matsker? Okay.  And the next house is pretty much next door.  is at 2228 Belmont Road, and its owner is Marilyn Lindenauer. Another mid-century modern house, this structure is one of only three residences in Ann Arbor designed by Alden Dow, who designed this building. Love it or hate it. Famous for his home and studio in Midland, and for many public buildings in Ann Arbor, including City Hall and the Ann Arbor District Library.  The house was built for Dr. and Mrs. Sidney Hubler in 1949. Hubler was a renowned cardiologist who founded one of the country's first hypertension clinics at the U of M. He served at the U of M hospital from 1947 to 74 and made the hypertension clinic an internationally renowned research center on high blood pressure. His home has been lovingly maintained by Martin and Marilyn Lindenauer, whose family has owned it since  at least 1992. Martin Lindauer was a professor of surgery at U of M for over 40 years and specialized in vascular disease. Is there a Lindenauer in the house? No? Another no-show. Okay, the next preservation award is for 3575 East Huron River Drive. The owner is Myra Larson.  An outlier on the banks of the Huron River, this 1953 mid-century modern unistrut house was designed by U of M professor of architecture Theodore Larson, an internationally recognized practitioner of modern design. The Larson family still lives here and maintains both the inside and outside of the house as it was originally designed.  Unistrut is a metal framing system with a unique weld-less connection. It has channels used to support heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems that are still in use today. I know she couldn't make it. I know that one.  The next preservation ward goes to Terry Mara for 717 West Huron. This lovely Tudor Revival style house has majestically looked over Huron Street since 1906. It was built for Titus Hutzel, a member of a prominent German family that installed central plumbing systems in Ann Arbor in 1900 and is still in business today as Hutzel Plumbing. Hutzel was also active in civic affairs.  serving as an alderman, president of the Board of Public Works, and trustee of Forest Hill Cemetery. Today's owner, Terry Mara, has kept it in fantastic condition since 1982, over 40 years. Terry.

Cooley helped organize the American Sociological Association in 1905 and became its president in 1918. It has been owned by Schott and Lighthammer and maintained by Campus Management for many years. There is some evidence that the house may have been designed by the famous architect  Irving K. Pond of Pond and Pond Architects, who designed the U of M League and the U of M Michigan Union.

Zahn and Duncanson had used Gardner Vose as their architect for the buildings on State Street, so it's possible that he designed this Tudor duplex as well. They display the characteristics of the style. Brick, half-timbering, ashlar stone trim around the doors, and finestra steel casement windows.

Hello, my name is Abigail McGinnis, and I'm a pediatric ICU doctor at C.S. Mott Children's Hospital. Doctors are seen as experts in safety, and as a pediatric ICU physician, I am deeply invested in the safety and well-being of our community members. Therefore, I am calling in support of the coalition for re-envisioning our safety, also known as CROS.  I'm excited that the resolution in support of the RFP issuance for the Unarmed Response Program affirms the importance of an independent non-police program that is accessible from a non-911 number and is in line with CROS's values. I have also read the Community Engagement Report by Public Sector Consultants and I am here to urge the City Council to prioritize the following three key findings in the report.  Firstly, to fund the unarmed public safety response from existing budget resources. Personally, I believe that some or all of this funding should be taken out of the existing policing budget. The city's commitment of ARPA funds to an unarmed response program is a great start, and ongoing sustained funding from the existing police budget is a great way to ensure this program remains robust, care-based, and accessible to all Ann Arbor residents. To me, this would demonstrate the city's commitment to addressing the root causes of conflict and crisis.  Secondly, the RFP should require the establishment of a separate number for unarmed response. A dedicated number for unarmed response can help streamline services, ensure appropriate response to non-emergency situations, and alleviate the burden on the 911 system.  Third and finally, the RFP should insist on the exclusion of police from the Unarmed Response Program. The program should focus on unarmed professionals for nonviolent situations, to reduce the risk of unnecessary use of force, as well as to enhance community trust and to encourage more effective community-based solutions.  By ensuring a non-police response, the Unarmed Response Program can be safely utilized by more people while simultaneously reducing the number of calls police are responding to. Reducing the number of police responses will alleviate the burden on Ann Arbor Police while freeing up existing police funds for other safety-promoting programs in our city.  I kindly request that the City Council take these findings into consideration when assessing the RFP for unarmed response and moving forward with its release. Finally, I want to extend my support for C2, the driving equality ordinance. As a pediatric doctor, I strongly support efforts to reduce interactions between police and residents, especially young residents and especially on our roads.  is a public health crisis that disproportionately harms our black, brown, and queer neighbors. This resolution is a fantastic step towards creating safer streets and a safer town for all our residents, neighbors, and visitors.

I was half hoping for a yes, but I guess not. But, in fact, I am a cranky old woman who drives cranky old Volvos. One of which is cranky enough and old enough to have a headlight that is consistently out. I went to repair it. It went out again. I gave up at some point. It's been like that for a while. But you know what? I never get stopped. You know why?  First of all, I'm a cranky old lady. Second of all, they are kind of late-ish model Volvos. Third of all, there is a Harvard alumni plate on each of them that I very intentionally put there because my mama didn't raise no fool. I am black. I rarely get stopped.  But let's talk about the numbers because other people aren't so lucky. So the Michigan State Police itself studied itself in 2021. That data revealed that traffic stops conducted in daylight were 18% more likely to have Latinos and 11% more likely to have blacks as the subject of those stops.  A study in a neighboring state found that one-third of the stops for minor traffic offenses were stops of black and Latino drivers. They were stopped twice as often as white drivers and far overrepresented in searches in being handcuffs and in being detained. But the incidence of contraband or evidence was lower than that of white drivers.  So Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Seattle, Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, and Berkeley in California have all implemented policies to limit or eliminate traffic stops for minor violations. And I encourage the city of Ann Arbor to join them.  We can go down a list, you know, there are numbers and then there are names, right? Ty Nichols was pulled over and beaten to death for reckless driving. Daunte Wright was pulled over for an expired registration tag. Rayshard Brooks was shot to death for falling asleep in his car at a Wendy's. Gabriel Navarro was shot 17 times while driving. Sandra Bland killed because an officer said she failed to signal a turn.  And of course, Philando Castile, who, before the police finally killed him in 2016, had been pulled over a staggering 49 times for minor traffic violations. Between 2016 and 21, police killed over 400 drivers or passengers who were unarmed and were not being pursued for a violent crime. And an outside proportion of them, as we know, were black and Latino. And that's an average of one person per week.  Right? So a busted taillight is not impacting public safety, neither is loud music, or an expired tag, or a window tint. The overall crime rate for these municipalities who implemented policies... Is that... Okay. Thank you."}, {"start": 2225.751, "end": 2230.293, "speaker": "SPEAKER_41", "text": "Thank you.

I'm here to speak deeply in favor of the proposal to stop executing traffic violations, stops by police in the city, the Pre-Tax stops. Decades of research have shown that traffic stops have an extremely disproportionate impact on black and brown and poor drivers, while white people driving fancy cars are subjected to an entirely different reality.  In some cases, like we have read about in Ferguson, Missouri, this leads to an outright cycle of terror for young, often poor, black men. We must soberly recognize that while Ann Arbor is not Ferguson, Ann Arbor is not not Ferguson, either. In fact, a recent report from the Citizens for Racial Equity in Washtenaw County, the crew report is damning, and I quote, the breadth of the racial disparities crew documented and the impact in terms of punishment on people of color are so stark  that CREW presents this report to our community with a call for immediate action by those institutions responsible for funding, administering, and overseeing the criminal legal system in Washtenaw County. The report found that in the county, prosecutors charge POC dramatically more than white people and that POC get worse treatment in the court system. The blatant reality is that the more contact that black people have with police, the more this racial disparity and punishment will widen.  And although that sounds bad, these are in fact life-ruining sentences, and the ramifications of these decisions are extremely serious. Nothing would be a racist and evil thing to do in this case. I'm looking forward to seeing how crows will begin to peel back the layers of policing in this county, finding, I hope, more and more instances in which the harsh punishment of imprisonment, as well as more minor retributions, are increasingly unnecessary. While we're at it, I would love to see Ann Arbor use its significant power in the county to encourage all municipalities to stop pretext stops  And I deeply encourage you to open a line of communication with the county prosecutor's office as well. The prosecutor's website states that they will, quote, no longer prosecute contraband cases that arise in pretext stops. Specifically, the prosecutor's office will no longer prosecute possession of contraband crimes that arise from a factual scenario, indicating that a police officer stopped a person for a minor infraction, but where their real goal was to uncover evidence that a civilian possessed drugs or other contraband. Unfortunately, the current reality is that the SABOT office is still prosecuting pretext stops,  It's their opinion that this policy stated on their own website only applies in scenarios in which the stop individual goes on specifically to give consent to the stopping officer to search their vehicle. This further specification of that policy renders it utterly unaware of the scope of this problem. Let us all be clear in our demand from the prosecutor to execute the pretext policy as stated. Stop prosecuting contraband from pretext stops immediately. And while I'm here, I'd quickly like to mention that if I were an Ann Arbor City Council member,  I'm just starting to worry about the city's biggest landlord and client, the University of Michigan, being under investigation by its accreditor for faking thousands of grades. You all might want to check on that and encourage them to make some confessions to GEO. Thank you all very much."}, {"start": 2643.481, "end": 2646.485, "speaker": "SPEAKER_41", "text": "Thank you.

I'm Dr. Lisa Jackson, the former chair of Ann Arbor's Independent Community Police Oversight Commission. For years, I advocated for transparency and accountability in policing in Ann Arbor. I'm here today in support of the Driving Equity Ordinance sponsored by Councilmember Cynthia Harrison and others. I've been stopped for not taking my handicapped placard down soon enough after leaving a grocery store when my daughter was in a wheelchair. I've had colleagues who've been stopped for having a child's graduation tassel hanging with pride from their rearview mirror.  I don't believe that the police or anyone feel that either of these were a threat to public safety. I perceive them, however, to be a pretext by which to stop and interrogate people who look like me. When I discussed these issues with Chief Cox, and specifically the claim that some people are concerned about that tinted windows make police less safe, he reminded me that in Florida, Arizona, Nevada, and California, tinted windows are in regular use and they have not posed a threat to police.  maybe we can do an exchange program and send some AAPD to these summer climbs. I saw Amy here, so maybe we can do like a trade-off thing. After much advocacy and my working for over 14 months, as you guys know, to get accurate traffic stop data from AAPD, the Southeast Michigan Criminal Justice Policy Research Project, called SMART, has finalized a report of traffic stops in Ann Arbor from 2017 to 2019.  Data on 2020, which is the first COVID year, are being analyzed separately. I worked very hard, as you know, upstream on this issue because traffic stops are the number one way in which people come in contact with the police. Just as Michigan State Police found when they had researchers at Michigan State analyze their data, the SMART team at Eastern has found significant disparities in the way drivers are policed in Ann Arbor at every single dimension examined.  Non-white motorists are stopped and searched more frequently than white motorists. The largest disparities should surprise no one. African-American male drivers were stopped for equipment violations, such as a hanging tassel, over 200% more than would be expected by the data, and they were searched after such stops between 365% and 500% more than would be expected by the data.  Middle Eastern male drivers were stopped 81% more often, while white female drivers were stopped less than should be expected by the data. There are certainly other statistically significant findings. Overall, the antiquated processes by which police are allowed to stop motorists do not keep us safer.  Allowing, supporting, and turning a blind eye to police with the discretion to search people who look like me, Lisa Jackson, while letting people who look like Lisa Dish off with a warning, or more significantly, not stopping her in the first place, do not keep us safer. The city of Ann Arbor needs to live up to its progressive image and join Philadelphia, Los Angeles, and other cities who have relied on data to bring their cities into the 21st century and to decrease the disparities with which people come into contact with police by way of traffic stops.

Good evening, Mayor, Council members. I am the current chair of the Independent Police Oversight Commission. A few years ago,  Our son was a student at Pioneer High School. He played on the basketball team. One Friday evening, as was our custom, his father and I went to the basketball game. We sat there and watched him play. After the game, we all got up and we left together. In the parking lot, we stopped and spoke with some other parents. Our son got into his old raggedy car and started home ahead of us down stadium.  Within 10 minutes or so, we also proceeded down stadium on our way home. When traffic light, I'm sorry, lights of a police car drew our attention, we looked over. Now this was a cold, dark night. And we looked over to see our son's car and our son with his coat unzipped and hands up like this standing on the sidewalk.  We walked over, we parked and walked over. At that time, by the way, I was working for the city of Ann Arbor in the city attorney's office. No, I take, yeah, or was I in the prosecutor's office? One or the other. In any case, I walked over, I said, what's going on? They said, who are you? I said, we're his parents. They said, we stopped him because he fits the description of someone who just robbed a store over on Broadway.  I said, what was the description? Young black man with a knit cap on. Did I tell you it was cold out? We said, we just left him at Pioneer High School. The officer looked at me and said, well, when we pulled him over, we smelled marijuana.  I'm not one to believe my children never did anything wrong. I went to the car. I said, you didn't smell marijuana. The officer says, oh, you're going to tell me my job? I said, yeah, I was trying marijuana cases when you were in high school. I almost said that. But I held back. Then they said,  Well, we found a weapon in the car. Weapon in the car? My son, because of the age of his car, had a rock. He would start the car up in the morning and it would cut off if he just left it. So he'd start up, put the rock on the gas pedal, and go inside to finish getting ready for school. Absolute everything wrong, not true. This is what happens.  It didn't matter to the police that night that my son, our son, was a National Honor Society two-time letter winner, an all-around good guy. That evening, he was a black man with a knit cap on. We strongly support the ordinance for equity in driving.

All right, so my very first interaction with police in my life, I was 12 years old, right here by University of Michigan Police Department by what was the Freeze Building. It's now North Quad, so I'm giving away my age here.  So I'm the embodiment of disparate traffic stops right here in Washtenaw County. My current case is being tracked by MLive and other local media outlets. Long story short, I was pulled over in Ypsilanti for failure to signal in a residential neighborhood and subsequently arrested for contraband.  I have never in my adult life committed a violent act, yet Ellie Savitt and Washtenaw County Police treat me as like a terrorist. I wonder why.  On the issue of police discretion in traffic stops, fact is discretion is not given to poor black people. Politicians the world over run these compassion campaigns, yet study after study, year after year, reveals ongoing patterns of anti-black, anti-poor, and anti-labor policing. NPR just revealed a Michigan State police study, once again affirming widespread and systemic disparities when dealing with black motorists in particular. But this is not news.  So how can poor, black, underrepresented constituents feel confident this will be any different? How are police and policy makers being held accountable aside from distractive identity politics to remind us, hey, at least we're not Trump? What is going to be gained from this discussion aside from thoughts and prayers?  There is the crew report, the Michigan State Police report, a mountain of scholarly academic literature in a valley of the mostly ignored and neglected experiences of millions of poor and black folks. This is both academic and simple. Black folks are adversely affected by discretionary policing, especially traffic stops. We even have a candidate for sheriff, a former beat cop who centered part of her campaign around eliminating quotas based on her personal experience as a cop.  Speaking engagements are great for PR, but what can voters actually expect? And to whom do they voice their opinions to since racist policing has been endemic for generations? In the words of Judge Arian Slay here in Washtenaw County, Washtenaw County prides itself on thinking left, but actually it looks right.  The idea that police need to do more to keep us safe is a force-fed idea, mostly by the Democrats. After all, the mood of the constituents at the time of their election in 2020 was to defund the police. How and when did the electorate suddenly change its mind on this issue? Or was this the decision of embedded elites who just cannot and will not fathom the terrifying prospect of the world changing before them? Of the political and fight... Am I done?  Thank you. Of the political and financial connections with the prison industrial complex and its irresistible and exhaustible golden honeypot. Thank you. If crime indeed drops and the world becomes a better place, the mighty apparatus of the police, prison guards, et cetera, would suddenly be out of jobs. And we just can't have that now, can we?

I served for three years as chair of the Ann Arbor Transportation Commission, and I still sit on the commission, but I'm speaking tonight only for myself. I'm calling in support of C2, the driving equality ordinance. As an advocate for road safety and a transportation system that serves everyone, I'm strongly in favor of policies that reduce interactions with the police on our roads. I realize that might seem incongruous,  but consider that the American Public Health Association has declared police violence to be a public health crisis. There is extensive evidence that police and policing cause harm to black, immigrant, indigenous, queer people and other people of color, as does involvement in the criminal legal system. If we want our roads to be safe for everyone, that means we have to consider not only safety from traffic violence, but also safety from state violence.  Secondary traffic stops for things like a broken taillight, tinted windows, and loud exhaust do not make our roads safer. But tonight, we've heard a lot about the extensive evidence that they do disproportionately harm people of color. And we've also heard personal testimony about our Black neighbors' experiences with excessive traffic stops in Ann Arbor. Ending this practice will move us a step closer to the safe, equitable, and just transportation system Ann Arbor aspires to.  While I'm here, I also want to express support for DC6, the resolution in support of an RFP issuance for the unarmed response program. This resolution recognizes the importance of creating an unarmed response program that is run independently by a third party. This is a structure that is widely supported by both established best practices in these programs around the country and by members of our local community.

This is Adam Driskevich calling from the Fourth Ward. I'd like to talk to you tonight about two items on your agenda, DC2 and C2. First, I'd like to talk about C2, the Driving Equality Ordinance. I am delighted to see this on the agenda tonight, and I hope to see it passed into the second reading unanimously and without being watered down. Thank you to Councilmember Harrison for bringing this forward, and for those of you who have already signed on as co-sponsors.  As we have seen in many cases around the country, interactions with police can be dangerous, particularly for people of color. We are not immune to that here, and we have seen the data showing that even we have disparities in how often people are pulled over and the outcomes of those stops.  This ordinance change will reduce these interactions with police, eliminating many that are, frankly, unnecessary anyway. Traffic enforcement can and should be limited to driving behaviors that are actually relevant to traffic safety, speeding, running red lights, road rage, failing to yield to pedestrians, and so on.  I hope the Driving Equality Ordinance will be uncontroversial among Councilmembers, as some other important ordinance changes have been, and I would love to see everyone jump on board to co-sponsor this tonight and at second reading. I would also like to mention that I am glad to see us continue to move forward with the RFP for an unarmed response program. I am following this with a lot of hope for what we can accomplish here in Ann Arbor with this and other reforms like the Driving Equality Ordinance.  I would also like to support DC2, the federal building plaza on Liberty Street. From my reading of this, it appears that the feds are going to be moving forward with redeveloping this plaza, whatever council has to say about it. I think it's great that we might be able to influence what these changes look like, and I like the ideas presented in the resolution. Pedestrianized streets are great, and I really enjoy our summer open streets over on Main Street.  If we can get a pedestrianized block of liberty out of the deal, it would certainly make that block more pleasant to visit. And what better place to put it than on the same block as the Blake Transit Center near the William and Division Bikeways? While I rarely bother to bring my car with me when I visit downtown, I know many people do. So the fact that it is only a block or so away from three large parking garages should alleviate that concern. Please also pass DC2 tonight.

There is no difference than what happens on the West Bank when a mother or a father or a son or a daughter or a grandparent in their own country have to have a work pass to go past a certain point.

Hi, everybody. My name is Alicia Dyer. For anyone who doesn't know, I served in law enforcement for many years. So I'll be speaking from that perspective about the traffic stop ordinance. I want to say thank you all that have worked on this, especially Cynthia Harrison, who  I know has put a lot of effort in this. Thank you, Jen Cornell, for co-sponsoring. And this issue is really important for law enforcement in a lot of ways. When I worked as a deputy on patrol in Washtenaw County, I remember pulling somebody over as a new recruit because their exhaust was loud. And in training, that was one of the stops that they told us that we could pull people over for.  I remember going up to the car and I remember seeing how scared they were of me because of this situation. And I asked him, I said, hey, I just pulled you over for your exhaust being loud. And then they went on very quickly to tell me how hard they were trying to fix their car and how they just did not have the money.  I remember walking back to my patrol car and sitting there wondering, why are we pulling people over for this? And then the hard pill to swallow of causing the trauma I did and pulling this person over for this offense. And I think that I now have a social work degree. And I think when we think about traffic enforcement, what we need to realize is it is a traumatic interaction for a lot of people in our community.  For law enforcement, when we pull someone over, that can be a dangerous interaction. And so we should minimize those interactions whenever possible. We should make them for safety reasons, but we should not be making them because of a registration sticker that got put in the wrong spot, or an air freshener, or a crack in the windshield. These things really hurt the trust that we are trying to build in communities.  And so the more that we can do ordinances like this I think are a step in the right direction to start reducing the unnecessary contact that doesn't really need to take place if it's not a safety risk or a safety hazard. I think that this will also help protect younger officers so they won't have to go through that situation I did on patrol and have to live with that trauma knowing that I caused harm.  And so the more that we can start restructuring our laws and our ordinances and what we have law enforcement do, the better we can actually have a community where people are not being harmed, not being killed, and not being injured because of our practices. And so I just want to thank you all for your work. I especially want to thank Cynthia Harrison. I know that you put a lot of work into this.

But their intentions here for this plaza redevelopment are clear. The resource is at the ready, and we should catch that wave and ensure that we get the best possible outcome for the city and its residents.  Specifically, I want to support the intent to use all of the adjacent right-of-way on Liberty Street for inclusion in this plaza. Unlike some more challenging public sites downtown, this site has the ingredients for successful and vibrant public plaza space. It has active uses facing multiple sides. It has terra firma for sustaining trees and other vegetation. It is open and transparent to the surrounding streets.  There will be logistical trade-offs and complications for the adjacent parcels and for those traveling through downtown, but those are small costs relative to the potential benefits this kind of space will bring. While I'm here, I also want to support passing CT2 to limit pretextual stops by the police and encourage your ongoing support for creating and funding an unarmed response program by passing DC6.  Whenever we use armed police to respond to community needs, we inevitably risk that resolution will come at the end of the barrel of a gun or other violent force. And it is marginalized people, as we've heard tonight, multiple stripes that suffer an unequal burden, and this is an avoidable outcome. So thank you for all of your work on this.  And lastly, I also support the passage of C1 at first reading tonight. We're in a housing crisis. We need more housing of all kinds. It's a high demand area to live. It's a site that sat vacant for far too long. The developer's plan comports with the zoning ordinance that applies to the site. There's no reason not to say no. There's no reason to say no to 200 additional homes, especially since it's coming with almost no parking.

Hi, Council. I'm the Reverend Donnell White and I live in the 500 block of Silo Church Road in the 4th Ward. I'm calling in to speak in support of the Driving Equity Ordinance C2. The majority of policing and police interactions with civilians nationwide occur during traffic stops. These are often civil infractions. But racial inequity is endemic in our criminal justice system.  And one key driver of those inequities is the so-called pretext or pretextual stop. These stops are made by police officers as a result of an observed traffic or ordinance infraction.  but they are really about an officer wanting to uncover evidence or to conduct a search. The data shows that black motorists are significantly more likely to be subjected to pretextual stops than white people, and pretextual stops are heavily associated with racial profiling.  As you know, your own Independent Police Oversight Committee noted during their update to Council on June 5th that this data isn't just coming from out there, nationwide. It's actually right here in Ann Arbor. According to the research conducted by the SMART Center at EMU,  that evaluated AAPD stop data from 2017 to 2019, it found significant disparities across every dimension examined. Black motorists are being stopped and searched in Ann Arbor more frequently than white residents. It makes it unsafe for me, a black resident, who is male, to drive in our city.  Now, what I've noted is you cannot train away racial bias. You actually have to change the underlying systems that allow racial bias to harm people like myself and other residents.  Anything else is a policy decision. It's a policy decision to support the ongoing racial bias that's embedded in our existing system. So I am incredibly grateful to Councilmember Harrison for taking on this important issue to ensure that I can move about the city freely. In addition, I want to offer my support for DC6, and I'm grateful that Unarmed Public Safety is moving forward in Ann Arbor.  I was heartbroken when I heard about Scott Fitzpatrick's experience when he called for a mental health wellness check, but instead watched his wife get arrested. They then incurred over $10,000 in fees and fines, and they have to live with the trauma of that experience for the rest of their lives.  This was a categorical failure of our community to care for each other. And so I'm grateful that the PSC Community Engagement Report affirms with the coalition re-envisioning our safety has already proposed over a year ago that public unarmed safety should be...

Question one comes in regards to the statement in the resolution. However, staff also found that deeds to additional lots within the park contain racial restrictions, either on the deeds themselves or by reference to other deeds that contain  racial restrictions. The question is, what do you mean by reference to the other deeds? Um, the second question is, what are, what were the racial restrictions? Um, Alma Dinger Park is made up of lot of a variety of lots donated by various individuals. Uh, the lots donated by almond beyond the family did not have any racial restrictions on the deed. However,  Other donated lots did have the racial restrictions, which are the lots within this resolution. In regards to what were the restrictions, the most common restriction was that no portion of the land herein described shall be occupied by persons other than the Caucasian race except as servants or guests. So that was question one. I will go ahead and go to number four.  which speaks to the whereas clause of whereas the City of Ann Arbor Parks and Recreation Services strives to provide exceptional experiences for all park visitors and residents, regardless of race, age, gender, sexual orientation, income level, ethnicity, or ability. Whereas the Park Advisory Commission believes everyone should feel safe, welcome, and respected in the city parks, and that removing these prohibitive restrictions from the deeds associated with Allmendinger Park is consistent with this goal.  Question related to that statement is, does this mean the Park Commission will perform a comprehensive review of all city parks to see if such other covenants exist? In speaking with PAC and at the PAC meeting, PAC fully supports the review of all city properties determined if other covenants exist, and PAC and park staff will follow the directive of council regarding this process.  Those are the two questions that I was charged with answering as they were related to the park side. Mr. McDonald has the other ones unless somebody has questions for me at this point."}, {"start": 5295.086, "end": 5296.667, "speaker": "SPEAKER_41", "text": "Mr. McDonald?"}, {"start": 5296.667, "end": 5565.615, "speaker": "SPEAKER_60", "text": "Kevin McDonald, Chief Deputy City Attorney. I'm going to respond to the rest of the questions. Question number two, on December 13th, 2022, the state of Michigan enacted the Discharge of Prohibited Restrictive Covenants Act, which allows Michigan property owners and Michigan community associations to record a discharge that affirmatively removes discriminatory restrictions from deeds and other recorded documents. How could a property owner do this?  is the first part of that question, and it says community organization. Does this mean these restrictions may exist on commercial real estate deeds as well? The process is detailed in the Discharge of Prohibited Restrictive Covenants Act, which is found at MCL 565.861. The statute provides a form  And a property owner can complete the form, have it notarized, and record it with, in our case, the Washtenaw County Recorder of Deeds, which is what is proposed here. There is also a simplified process defined for homeowners associations and for platted subdivisions and association boards for condominiums to take action at the request of those members.  These are the organizations that were being referred to in the memo as community associations. These residential restrictions could exist on commercial real estates, property use, changes over time, and although these were restrictive covenants for residential and they're illegal and enforceable, that language could still exist in those documents.  Question number three, whereas the lots with restrictions are within Oakcrest subdivisions, lots 147, 48, 49, et cetera, does the Oakcrest subdivision still exist?  If so, does the rest of the subdivision still have the covenants? The city attorney's office did not complete a search for any property outside of park land owned by the city. It was just out of the scope of what we were asked to do. The platted subdivision, Oak Crest subdivision, which included Almendinger Park, included lots from Oak Creek subdivision. So it would follow that there are likely other lots that reference the same illegal, unenforceable, restrictive covenants.  Question number five, the city owns and has recently acquired land for the Greenbelt. Did any of that land have racial covenants on the deeds? If so, did the staff already go through the steps to discharge them? And our answer is the city has not reviewed the deed history for recently required properties for racial covenants or any other illegal unenforceable covenants. We can ask title companies to review this in future transactions proactively. Question number  Number six, does staff know if any of the Ann Arbor Public School-owned land has racial covenants on the deeds, including the new lots the district recently purchased? For example, we know that certain neighborhoods and subdivisions had racial covenants, as the Hannah subdivision recently had their racial covenant discharged last year. The assumption would be that a school within that subdivision area could have a covenant as well, depending on when it was built, correct?  and that staff has no knowledge. Properties not owned by the city were not proactively researched for racial covenants. It was just this one-time action. And then finally, seven, does council need to pass a resolution for a comprehensive review of deeds for city-owned land, or can staff do that in accordance with our past equity resolutions?  We will incorporate a search for these restrictive covenants proactively in future property acquisitions and when we have other reasons to be researching deeds. But I would ask that council pass a resolution for us to complete a comprehensive review after further consultation with the administrator and the city attorney due to the significant resources involved. There are approximately 165 parks with some consisting of multiple parcels  without including other city properties, such as City Hall, for example, which has about eight parcels underneath it. A quick, very preliminary estimate is that it would take 400 to 500 hours minimum to complete the searches for parks property only, which may only be possible using city attorney's, city attorney office staff, a consultant, or title company. And that completes the staff introduction for that item."}, {"start": 5569.645, "end": 5573.076, "speaker": "SPEAKER_30", "text": "We do.

Thank you. My name is Glenn Wazorek. I'm the engineer at the Water Treatment Plant. I will be introducing CA-18 and responding to two questions. By way of introduction, sorry, thought you'd want to look at my face maybe.  By way of introduction, this resolution requests acceptance of a grant for PFAS treatment upgrades at the water treatment plant. More specifically, the grant program is called the Consolidation and Contamination Risk Reduction Grant Program, which will be administered by EGLE, Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy.  The grant amount is $491,122, to which we are proposing the design and construction of two filter upgrades to strengthen PFAS removal performance. The two questions proposed to me, CA18 question one,  It reads, since we're replacing only two of the lower profile underdrains, I'm assuming we still need to eventually fund the replacement of the 14 other underdrains that need more clearance to more efficiently filter PFAS. In the meantime, how are we addressing this issue? Are we actually running the water plant at a lower capacity, or do we have another way to remove the PFAS?  A response to question one, our current flows at the water plant are well below the plant's design capacity of 50 MGD. So the filters are operating well below their maximum capacity, but we don't want to restrict the flow as demand increases over time. It's important to note that we are meeting all PFAS  regulations under all current conditions. We are constructing these two filters to take advantage of the grant and to validate performance prior to investing in the remainder. But due to excess capacity, we have additional time where we'll likely be incorporating the remaining filters in a future capital project.  CA18 question number two reads, regarding the project budget, the memo says $1 million of the required $1.291 million for this project is included in the approved fiscal year 24 water supply capital budget. The EGLE grant is providing $491,000  Why does another $291,000 need to be appropriated? Wouldn't this grant bring us to $1,491,000 in available funding? There's a lot of numbers.

The project total cost estimate has been determined to be $1,291,000. So we're looking to appropriate the difference, which is that additional $291,000 to cover the difference.  The water fund must front the full project cost. This is a financial accounting practice requirement. The water fund will be reimbursed the full grant amount of $491,000 when it becomes available. So to reiterate, the total project cost  is $1,291,000, not the $1,491,000 in the question. Thank you."}, {"start": 5896.592, "end": 5905.623, "speaker": "SPEAKER_41", "text": "Thank you.

As stated in the first reading, this ordinance is not unprecedented, as hundreds of other cities, along with some states, have similar restrictions on the sale of animals.  The main purpose of this ordinance is to prohibit irresponsible sourcing of animals from inhumane facilities and to encourage pet acquisition directly from reputable breeders or other responsible sources like shelters and rescues. These actions are proven to protect consumers, promote humane business practices, and contribute the overall health of pets in our community. However, I understand this has been met with some opposition from some lobbying groups that may speak tonight or in some council members  In boxes opposed to taking this these 3 minutes to tell you a bunch of legislation that these organizations have lobbied against that would improve the lives of animals. I will just let you know that these organizations have the heart of the commercial pet industry at heart.  They work from a monetary basis. They don't consider animal welfare at the source of what they do. And with that, I hope all of our city council members will make a decision that's in favor of animal welfare and not this pet industry.

I'm a third ward resident on Brooklyn.  No one condones the animal abuse, substandard kennels, irresponsible breeders. This ordinance does not address those issues. That being said, I have concerns with this ordinance. Seemingly, the Humane Pet Acquisition Ordinance has been a working process for quite a period of time before it was presented to council last session. As of Thursday when I visited several pet shops,  none of the stores had heard of the proposed ordinance. The three stores visited that sell live animals are all impacted by this ordinance. The point being all stakeholders should have been brought in early into the discussion, not just in this past week or two.  The ordinance erodes consumer protection. Under Michigan compiled law, MCL 281.3358, section 5, pet stores are required to have current pet health care certificates valid within 30 days from the sale of a dog or cat at retail. Shelters do not have the same requirement.  Pet stores also have certificates of origin for all their animals. The consumer will know what qualified breeder or qualified licensed kennel the dog or cat came from.  The ordinance shrinks consumer options with the goal of matching families' lifestyle with the dog's temperament. Random source dogs do not fulfill that goal. A 2017 study by the ASPCA and the study by the American Pet Products Association showed that 3.3 million dogs entered shelter. Meanwhile, close to 90 million pet dogs are in the United States.  The average lifespan of a dog is 11 years. The annual rate of death of dogs is close to 9 million pet dogs a year.  The ordinance plan is unsustainable. Over the past several years, shelters intakes have been going down. The demand for dogs have been going up.

I'm Tanya Hilgendor from the CEO of the Humane Society of Huron Valley and longtime Ann Arbor resident. I'm here to give our enthusiastic support and gratitude for this ordinance to ban inhumane pet retail sales in Ann Arbor. There are currently an estimated 10,000 puppy mills operating in the United States, confining roughly 500,000 dogs solely for breeding.  Nearly all pet stores and online dealers get their puppies from mills notorious for abuse and neglect. The less well known this is also true for kittens and other animals sold as pets.  Though many mills are unlicensed, even if licensed, regulations are woefully lacking and minimally enforced. The rules around commercial breeding are almost 60 years old and don't address what we now know today scientifically about what animals need mentally and physically. Rather, they ensure just enough to keep the animal alive in their misery. Animals kept in mills are treated just as commodities and their most basic needs, food,  medical care are denied to increase profit margins. In puppy mills, mother and father dogs spend their entire lives in small, stacked, wire-bottom cages, required to just be six inches larger than their actual bodies their entire lives.  They never play, go for a walk, or snuggle with a family. Sickly mothers are forced to have litter after litter until their bodies are spent, and they are killed in cheap and violent ways.  Meanwhile, Michigan pet stores go 100% unregulated. In 2008-19, HSHV investigated a local pet store that let, among many violations, let sick puppies die in a back room without any vet care and just left their bodies there.  Their puppies came from a Hillsdale puppy mill that was also investigated by the Attorney General. Both operations continue to thrive today because of absurdly mild penalties and unsuspecting consumers. Of course, we prefer that families adopt a homeless animal and help save a life. But when that can't happen, we ask that consumers go directly to small family responsible breeders where good living conditions can be verified in person.  Pet stores and online dealers are the lifeblood that keep puppy mills alive. Until we have federal action like we saw in the UK, ordinances like this are an effective and important step forward to stemming this intense and systemic cruelty. Thank you to Councilmember Ackman and all of Council for considering this compassionate and forward-thinking proposal.

I am the current resident of Franklin, Michigan, but I'm a lifetime resident of Michigan. Just wanted to call and express my support and encourage the council to pass the pet store ordinance tonight.  As someone who is very active in the animal rescue community, I've had personal experience caring for dogs that come from puppy mills that had been intended to be sold at pet stores. Instead, these dogs are either aged out of their cute phase or the female dogs were no longer valuable because they couldn't have any more litter. These dogs spend most of their life filled with fear. Even after spending months in foster homes, they're typically extremely anxious and there may be no correcting that.  And just to be clear, there is no reputable breeders that will sell their dogs to pet stores. We've talked to just hundreds of them. They deal with the families directly. So this ordinance in no way stops reputable breeders from selling their dogs to families. So, you know, families are still able to get dogs directly from breeders if there's a specific breed that they're looking for. And then in addition to the problems surrounding the puppy mill pipeline and pet stores really lack the proper living conditions for almost all species.  The overcrowded small living spaces are necessary to show animals to consumers, but it's really not adequate for any animal to thrive. That's not only true for dogs and cats, but it also includes birds, rabbits, and reptiles. So this ordinance is very important not only to protect these voiceless animals, but to also protect the public. So I appreciate your time and consideration.

And also, are there any stores that are problems in Ann Arbor? And I would hope that the council and mayor, you think about collective punishment and only focus on bad actors and people in stores who are problems. You know, I hate to see these things pass when, you know, someone could be doing it right. I worked for a pet store in  College, I've trimmed hundreds of dog and cat toenails. We were mainly a grooming business, but occasionally we sold puppies, and we socialized with puppies. The owner was a veterinary technician. Numerous times I saw her spend an hour or two with people who would come in crying because their veterinarian would not spend enough time with them to go over common pet nutrition facts with them, and instead just wanted to prescribe medications. And I saw her turn over 100 unhealthy puppies into healthy puppies. And this was a legitimate pet shop owner who did a great job for the community.  and those animals, and something like this would have put her out of business. And it's just a shame to see that happen. Our puppies all came from very small breeders who were locally, they were all locally sourced. And again, this would put a store like her out of business. And there are lots of Michigan laws, including Chapter 750, chapters  9 and 25 of Chapter 750 that address pain and suffering, duty to provide care, animal cruelty, and more. So hopefully those laws could be in place regarding reptiles. Every animal coming into the state requires a USDA veterinarian certificate of veterinary inspection. So that's covering your reptiles. And again, I would hope that rather than painting this with a broad brush, you actually look at people who have problems  People are always going to have pets, and you're taking away the most public and heavily regulated possibility for them to get those pets. And who knows where they may get their pets from? So I would hope that you would allow responsible pet stores to stay in business in Ann Arbor.

I have lived at 1321 Forest Court for over 40 years. I am strenuously opposed to the application for a PUD project at 721 South Forest. I strongly support the thoughtful analyses of Matt Kowalski and the Planning Department staff to reject  this project. The proposed luxury student apartment building is totally inconsistent with the zoning of this site and the land use goals of the city's master plan. It significantly exceeds any density and building size permitted for this zoning district. It disregards the existing buildings around it on and adjacent to South Forest between Forest Court and Hill, a diverse and pleasant area of well-maintained residences, small apartment buildings, fraternity and sorority houses, and a child care center.  It contravenes the central area land use recommendations that seek to encourage appropriate development and transitions and to protect the existing character of neighborhoods. This project clearly does none of this, unlike the recently constructed small apartment buildings at 727 South Forest and adjacent to it at 1315 Hill, as well as the Towsley Children's House.  The proposal is in complete violation and makes a mockery of the zoning created by the City Council in recent past, establishing D1 and D2 zones with transitional step-downs to preserve the character and integrity of the R4C area surrounding.  It seeks to do via a PUD what the established zoning will not allow. Ignoring the city master plan and central area plans for this PUD is not how city planning is done, nor should Ann Arbor be remade through single-site spot zoning.  like this. This is precisely the only purpose of this request for a PUD for this project to circumvent the existing zoning of this site. I strongly urge you to reject this PUD proposal that is in total violation of the zoning and of the purposes of the Planning and Developments  Approval will only open the way for other such PUD proposals in the R4C zoned area between Willard and Hill and beyond, no doubt. I could support a newer apartment building of similar size to the current one on this site if this one is antiquated. I would encourage that it require affordable housing in this building, not just a one-time fee.  There are still D1 and D2 parcels on Southview, on Church, on Willard that have not been developed into student high-rise housing. They're still there, they're still available. There's all of the transit corridor TC1 rezoning that you've passed and that is being speeded along and has not yet been subject to dense development.

I am here to speak in favor of it here tonight. The site is immediately next door to another previously contentious high-density development proposal, Forest Plaza.  which nearly 100 years ago, was originally proposed as a luxury nine-story building on the street. This proposal triggered anti-development backlash, forcing the reduction of a building by four stories and forcing the building back from the edge of the lot. And it also led to further restrictions in our zoning ordinance that limited dense development near campus.  One of a few series of backlashes that happened through the history of the city that has limited housing. This PUD is a symptom of a problem that we began creating for ourselves 100 years ago. We have had the good fortune to live in a city that is home to one of the premier public universities on the planet, created and supported by the people of the state of Michigan. The significant public investment creates a natural demand for housing as closely as possible to campus.  This was true 100 years ago, and it remains true today. Our efforts to limit the ability to build and to meet this demand has created the reality that we live in now with scarce, expensive, often extremely low-quality housing to anyone who wants to live in our city. If we had allowed many more forest plazas as originally proposed 100 years ago, we would have avoided digging our housing hole yet deeper, putting further barriers up to substantial new housing  for subjective preferences or to reach goals that can't practically actually be realized right now, will contribute to our history of exclusion, contribute to our ongoing case of housing scarcity. So I please encourage you to approve this proposal tonight.  And I did describe this PUD as a symptom. There's other PUDs coming in the same area. I agree with the previous speaker. We're probably going to see more of these. And it's a symptom that something's wrong. I still think we should approve it because the housing situation is desperate. But I think we really need to be rethinking our zoning much more broadly. But we don't have time to wait five years for a comprehensive plan rewrite, ordinance rewrites, just to provide enough housing for the people who want to live here now.  And we know downtown, nothing new really has been built or approved since the recent ordinance updates a few years ago. We've put up all kinds of barriers. We have an unwritten rule book that we hear at Planning Commission over and over again of things we'd like to see that lead to rejections.  You know, all of which are goals I think we all share, but we're not getting what we want using the tools we've been using forever. And so I think if we want to actually get there, we need to start taking a little bit of risk, allowing some things to happen, and actually letting people meet the demand that is there.

If you look around downtown and if you look around South University, there is tons of new development. We have not been slow to develop recently. First of all, I hope that you will consider these things when you consider granting PUD status here. You're planning  staff and your Office of Sustainability both gave reports that asked you to deny the approval of the PUD. This should give you pause. You have experts on your staff who are saying this does not meet the requirements for a PUD. Their reports are well substantiated, and they give ample reason of why this does not have the public benefit for a PUD.  Any proposal to circumvent an existing zoning by use of a POD should give you pause, should make you think about the planning process and whether it's a valuable tool for a city to use.  These comments came up in the planning commission. A planning commissioner was asked, the commissioner asked the developer, if perhaps a change of zoning would be more amenable to the kind of development that he was proposing. And the reply was, it took too long to do that.  Thus the resort to a speedy alternative, a PUD that circumvents the zoning, that does not take into consideration the neighborhood or what the long-term plan for this neighborhood is. Another commissioner said, if not here, where?  Within walking distance of that site are some empty lots. There is an empty lot at Washtenaw and Observatory. There's something that's being used as a parking place across Washtenaw. There are alternative sites that don't require removing a relatively affordable student apartment building and putting in something that will be  both disregarding the nature of the neighborhood and will not be more affordable. So not sustainable, not affordable, not a public benefit. Please think about these things. We're about to embark on a new comprehensive plan, and so shouldn't we take that, take the slow step,  Sorry, but I think that in the long run, the slow step looking at a comprehensive plan is a better idea. I urge you to consider factors beyond adding density. One commissioner, one planning commission indicated that he did not see that this was a neighborhood worth preserving.

It makes a farce out of our city's zoning regulations, and recent attempts to steer high-density buildings into the D1 zone and along transit corridors. Small residential buildings are now at risk to be overpowered by these behemoths.  Out-of-scale buildings block our air and light. They reflect the sun's heat in the summertime, weaken and kill native plants, and cause destructive wind shears.

Yes, it's only a few buildings away from the taller structures on South U, but it will tower over the properties directly north, south, east, and west, including our home.  We're concerned about the impact of traffic flow and parking in the area. We're worried about the impact to the trees and the green space in the area, as others have said. We're concerned about the aesthetic of the building as it sits less than a block from the historic district, like I mentioned, and across from our home that we feel is charming and old and carries its own proud history.  We're concerned about how this development will impact future development on the block. It's, you know, I think others have said this, it seems like it could be the first of many in our area or, you know, around Ann Arbor.

We need to be more thoughtful about how we use all of the space and how we think about putting appropriately sized buildings, including high rise apartments in the places where they fit, not simply shoving them into the neighborhoods in the name of a housing crisis. I really encourage you to think this through. This is a big decision. Once it goes up,  It doesn't come down, and there are many more behind it.

There have been a number of discussions around encouraging electrification or even banning natural gas. Well this development is fully electric.  We are installing solar panels so that some of the energy needs will be generated on site. They're increasing the efficiency of the envelope with extra insulation to eliminate thermal bridging. All of these are great and seem to be above and beyond what we require in the building code. Another benefit.  This location is easily walkable to campus and to local businesses that are frequented by students. It's right in the thick of things in terms of student living, so residents will likely not need to drive much. This is great because we are trying to cut vehicle miles traveled in half. This benefits our Vision Zero goals as well as our A20 goals. Furthermore, this building would pay $4.7 million into our affordable housing fund.  which Jennifer Hall and the Housing Commission can leverage into more wonderful developments like 121 Catherine, the old wide lot at 5th and William, and other projects coming down the pike. These benefits to the city seem substantial to me, hence my confusion. This seems to check all of the boxes. Please approve this rezoning and the site plan tonight. And echoing the thoughts of Mr. Trudeau, please tear down the barriers that make this kind of development difficult so we can meet the demand for housing in Ann Arbor. Thank you."}, {"start": 8642.462, "end": 8642.822, "speaker": "SPEAKER_42", "text": "Thank you."}, {"start": 8642.822, "end": 8657.198, "speaker": "SPEAKER_49", "text": "Michelle Hughes, do you have a comment?"}, {"start": 8657.198, "end": 8808.983, "speaker": "SPEAKER_51", "text": "Hi. Yeah.  This building, so what a community requires is community members. That's how you make a community. That's what a community is made of. And we have an option to either allow people to be, we have an option to either welcome people into our community or to keep people out of our community. We could say, hey, this is just the way we like it.  I don't want it to change. But then it'll change anyway because the price of housing will go higher and higher, the more exclusive we get. The community will change anyway because the impact of all the people who have to live outside of town and drive in will be felt by us as we have to make more and more parking lots for people who have to drive in from outside.  So I think it's very important that we allow new housing developments, allow new neighbors, allow new community members. And this is a great opportunity to do all of that. You know, even if it didn't have all of these, all of these specific environmental things that they're doing, such as full electrification and the thermal insulation,  It would still be a boon for our community and it would still be a net gain for environmentalism because it would allow more people to live car free and to walk to school and walk to work and walk to the things that they want to do. And I think there are plenty of people that if you give them that chance, that's the exact opportunity that they want. So we should be in the business of giving people that opportunity. This is a  great project because it will also give money to the affordable housing fund. So not only will the people who move into this building have an opportunity to live here, but we'll have more opportunities for people to live downtown in a subsidized apartment later on. So this is all positives, no negatives. And  I think that they're already offering us."}, {"start": 8808.983, "end": 8811.663, "speaker": "SPEAKER_49", "text": "30 seconds."}, {"start": 8811.663, "end": 8832.887, "speaker": "SPEAKER_51", "text": "And a lot of stuff here.

Hi, Adam Goodman speaking to you from the 5th Ward. You've heard this from other people, but I'm going to say it again. The city of Ann Arbor is facing a housing affordability crisis. This means that we need more housing at all income levels, both market rate and subsidized.  And this project that is in front of you tonight would do a significant amount to address both of those needs. It would directly provide a significant number of units of market-rate student housing in a location that, frankly, I can't imagine a better one for high-rise student housing. It's two blocks from campus. It's a block from Ricks. Where else are we going to do something like this, right?  But also, as part of this project, there will be a contribution of, I believe the number was something like $4.7 million, the Affordable Housing Fund. This is badly needed. A couple of years ago, residents of Ann Arbor passed a millage to raise money to pursue a lot of very ambitious affordable housing construction projects.  That millage was never going to be enough to meet our ambitions. And this has gotten worse. Because of inflation, supply chain issues, and various other problems, construction costs for affordable housing have skyrocketed. I have seen, and I'm sure you have seen, many discussions, presentations, and memos from city staff speaking to this exact issue.  The city needs a lot more money in the affordable housing fund to achieve the goals that you have set out for it. And I'm not going to claim that this one project will solve all of that, but let me put it in perspective for you. $4.7 million is more than 70% of the money raised from the entire city or the affordable housing fund millage in a year. This would  This would get most of the way towards doubling the amount of revenue you would get for the affordable housing fund in a year. And by increasing the tax base, it would provide a permanent increase to the money raised by that millage and every other millage. So. 30 seconds. I'm similarly perplexed to  My friend, Adam Deskevich, about why there is even any question about what the right answer is here. I encourage you all to vote yes on this tonight.

I just wanted to say that $4.7 million is a heck of a lot of money for affordable housing.

I don't know how that works scientifically, but I just think that the idea that someone can say remove the air and then just get to completely ignore both the housing crisis and the impact on the environment that comes from sprawl, because here's the thing about people. If you don't build homes for them where they want to live, they still got to live somewhere.  And if they can't live where their jobs are, they spread out. And the ways that we get from one place to another, specifically in Michigan, are inadequately environmentally friendly.  I think that it's kind of just absolutely absurd for folks to be making stuff up and then trying to say that we should just flush down $4.7 million that can go for affordable housing down the drain on top of the housing that's super needed. And I honestly don't see very much difference between that type of dismissive ideology about stuff that fundamentally comes down to caring about your neighbors  And a lot of the stuff that I'm seeing here in Ottawa County.

My name is Alyssa Miller. I'm with the Pet Advocacy Network. And on behalf of the responsible pet care community, we are asking that you vote no on this proposed ordinance and work with the entirety of the stakeholders to create a humane ordinance that would benefit the community at large.  All of us in the responsible pet care community are dedicated to ensuring that the appropriate care of animals is the primary focus of any law or regulation. At the Pet Advocacy Network, we regularly work with all levels of government to make sure that any law or regulation that is put in place has the interest of animals and responsible and healthy animal-to-human companionship at heart. We welcome the opportunity to work with the City  in raising the bar to ensure proper animal sourcing that would protect dogs, cats, ferrets, rabbits, long-lived birds, and large reptiles. And a common-sense solution would be to require that animals only come from appropriate licensed breeders while working with the existing Ann Arbor pet store community.  It's been mentioned both in the press and here tonight that there are no statutory regulations that govern pet stores. And concerned about these claims, I actually reached out to the program manager at the state level for all shelter and breeding programs to inform me that pet stores indeed do have state statutory requirements. And depending on what animals and species they sell or adopt, they may also have federal and local animal orders requirements.  So, luckily, the federal government and the state of Michigan have taken steps to protect and ensure the safety of animals by enacting several layers of regulation and law. Walt-Well intentioned retail pet sale bans will not stop the bad breeder for unregulated, unlicensed, and not held accountable. We agree that these bad actors who mistreat and neglect animals must and should be put out of business, but unfortunately,  and we have seen them have the opposite effect, oftentimes creating an unregulated black market for pets, including, again, dogs, cats, and the animals that are included in this ordinance. In California, when they announced a statewide ban, vets saw an uptick in sick animals that had been purchased online  And there was no way to provide any recourse for the animal or the owner who was seeking the best care for it. Again, we hope and we would love to be able to work with the city to create an ordinance that would benefit everyone, including the animals and protect animals while also protecting pet choice and allowing the residents of Ann Arbor to be able to choose the pet that best fits them, their current situation and their family.

I would like to echo the others who spoke about denying 721 South Forest PUD. It seems like our zoning laws mean next to nothing now with all these exceptions for high-rises in neighborhoods where they do not belong. As others have said, this building was denied by staff for a number of good reasons. I want you all to think about the dangerous precedence that you are setting by approving these PUD high-rises south of South University.  I live half a block from a number of student rental houses on South Forest, a few blocks south of the 721 South Forest site in North Burns Park. And I wonder all the time, what if a developer purchased those rental houses on South Forest and applied for a PUD to build a high-rise there, just like what just happened on Church Street? My beautiful 1910 half-timbered house, which easily could have been featured in the historic preservation presentation earlier,  has been lovingly maintained at great expense to us over the years. Next door to a high-rise, it would become worthless. So would our quality of life. If my South Forest nightmare comes true, more high-rises will probably follow, destroying a longstanding historic neighborhood through the misguided notion that the city is somehow contractually responsible for creating housing for University of Michigan students. It is not.  I want each and every one of you to think about what you would do if this happened on your block or around the corner from your home. The way that this council prioritizes developers over neighborhoods shows a dismaying lack of respect and short-sightedness. Ann Arbor already has plenty of high-rise zones. That is where they should be building high-rises. It is simply unfair and wrong to grant these exceptions for these luxury private dormitories  that the city seems so obsessed with. They have not solved our housing problems over the last 15 years, and they won't do so now. The more you approve these high-rise PUVs, the more you will embolden developers to propose them in the first place where they do not belong. I am begging you, please don't open the door to this trend cascading down South Forest. That is what my family would call a housing crisis.

Hello, my name is Nishant Kedarpal. Thank you for taking the time to hear my comments today. I live in Ward 5 on Liberty Street. I am in huge support of this project. It is already a bunch of student apartments instead of being old.  and including a lot of parking, they will be modern, environmentally friendly, electrified, contribute to the affordable housing fund, and they will house more students than they do right now. Some of those people might not be students, but given the neighborhood, like others have said, it's a no-brainer that this should house as many students as possible on this parcel. You know, my own personal experience is informed by growing up in the city, having siblings who went to the university for undergrad, and now myself attending as a grad student.  And it's hard to find housing. And in particular, there are students, particularly undergrad students, folks from, say, out of state with more family resources, who can afford to live in more expensive, newer buildings. And by building modern, high-rise student housing with attractive amenities,  that keeps lower-priced housing in the rest of the neighborhood, older buildings, et cetera, available. And so we should be building as much of this as big as possible, as few vehicle parking spots as we can. And, you know, without those, it would be crazy to turn down almost $5 million.  So, yeah, and I'm in strong support of this bill. This is PUD, and I urge the council to make systematic changes to the Uniform Development Code such that these things don't need to get hauled in front of council and the planning committee, especially when we're doing good work on bi-rights rezoning in other corridors of the city. If you want, we should look at the downtown zoning and other categories to make these sorts of approvals bi-rights, in particular in neighborhoods that already have a lot of them.  high-rises oriented towards students, for example, like the Southview Forest Corridor.

To be honest with you guys, I'm not actually a big fan of this PUD. 98 vehicle parking spaces, it seems excessive and providing more subsidized parking is really quite contrary to the city's climate and sustainability goals. 650% maximum floor area ratio, that is a pit stop.  We should be seeing 3,000 to 5,000 percent max FAR. And only 12 stories? Is that all? This area needs more buildings like the nearby University Towers, which is 18 stories tall. Or perhaps this should be the site of Ann Arbor's very next Tower Plaza. I could go on, but I think this indicates my displeasure with this.  But when I studied engineering, one of the most important things I learned about was trade-offs. And in this particular case, I think that the only thing that could be worse than approving this PUD would be not approving it. I agree with many others who have said that PUDs are bad workarounds to the current zoning. In my professional field of software development, this is called a codesmith.  This PUD is an indicator not just of problems at this site, but that our zoning as a whole is bad and needs fixing, and we need to be doing that. But we cannot afford the steep cost of waiting until a new comprehensive plan before allowing this PUD through. We need to keep moving forward  with what we have while we're working on what will come next. We're in a housing crisis and the less housing we allow as a city, the more we as a city are choosing to take housing away from people.  Perhaps those who have spoken out tonight in opposition to this PUD would be willing to chip in to replace the $4.7 million of money that denial of this PUD would deny to our affordable housing fund. Or maybe they'd be willing to open their own houses to replace the 631 additional bedrooms that would be lost if we don't approve this PUD.  approve this PUD now and improve the comprehensive plan so that these sorts of developments can be by right in future.

So this is related to the site plan of this building. I, Scott Trudeau, again, this building that has 733 bedrooms in it. So some previous public commenters  asked some good questions like, who do you all represent? Who is this building for? Who is the city for? And yes, the 733 bedrooms in this building would probably be mostly occupied by wealthy students that are attending the University of Michigan. And so if you say no to this development, you're saying no to those 733 homes, where will those 733 wealthy students go?  As our friend Ottawa County Joe pointed out, people have to live somewhere. And if you don't build the housing that they want to live in where they want to live, they'll live somewhere else. Are those 733 students going to decide, never mind.  University of Michigan is one of the best schools in the country. Maybe it was really hard to get into, but they didn't build this apartment building, so I'm not gonna come here. Of course not. They're gonna find the next best option, and then where do the people who would otherwise be living in those apartments go? And so on. So by saying no to this, we're excluding 733 people from our community that would wanna live here.  I mean, that's just the reality of how the musical chairs of the market goes. And we are also saying no to millions of dollars of affordable housing funding. Now, as Adam Goodman pointed out, that is not only the $5 million, but also the tax money over time.  that will support all kinds of things. What hasn't been pointed out is that money is always leveraged with other grants and funding sources. So every dollar we bring in that's unconditional like this into our fund, we can leverage multiple times over again. So it's not $5 million, it's $25 million or more.  that can be put to good use in all of the ambitious projects that we have lined up. So we'd be saying no to those people. And we'll be saying no to the people who come here looking for housing and because 730 students came looking for somewhere to live are taking the place that they might have otherwise taken. I'm sorry, there's no room for you here.  And so yeah, we've spent 100 years finding reasons to say no. Everyone can enthusiastically support an imaginary building that can't actually be built. 100% affordable, 100% green, passive house perfect, and two stories tall for thousands of people. It can't happen. And if we demand things that can't happen, we get nothing. And if we get nothing, we know what the outcome is. What was the other thing?  Yeah, so lastly, I'll just say that somebody asked, what about if it was next to my home? I live in a very similar neighborhood. I live in a 1904 house. And I say, yes, please build a high rise in my neighborhood. I'm sure many student renters who live here would love it.

I understand the housing crisis and I completely agree we need more housing, but it's the where. And are you gonna just ignore planning and staff and the people we pay as a city who have thought through  The city's plan and have evaluated this and recommended against. Are you going to ignore those people who we as a city pay to evaluate things like this and simply just approve this? And as they said, approve the many more like it they have planned.  You are talking about a domino effect that when this goes up, you might as well just go ahead and just roll out the red carpet for developers as opposed to asking them to do what's right, which is to go and buy the properties that are in the locations that are already zoned.  for a building like this that would address the housing crisis, to acknowledge that as I walked through that neighborhood today, there are already buildings being built in that neighborhood that will help address the housing crisis. It's not about whether or not we need it. It's just the question of, can we just go up and build these anywhere? Could we go down to Burns Park and just put one vertical because we have some space there?  Could we go over to the old west side and just put a 12 story building right there? I just think there's a lot of questions about where we put our buildings. And I agree, it's a student neighborhood, but it's a student neighborhood mixed with single family. It's part of the unique character of Ann Arbor. And the question is, do you want to fundamentally change that? Do you want to change the university and the city's unique relationship?  I employ a lot of students. I'm a university faculty. I love our students. I care about our students. However, the idea that we should just willy-nilly put buildings anywhere because we need more housing for students, and the idea that a single housing unit is going to somehow solve all of the trickle-down effect,  It is just false. I do think you could build a building that would be tall, maybe even slightly taller than the one that's there, but a true step down, and truly incorporate affordable housing. My father spent his career in tax-accredited affordable housing. I understand this space better than most outside of that space, and I can say with great certainty, if we did that, that would be a positive, and I would be very supportive of it. I just think this is just a veiled comment that is intended to make profit for a Texas-based developer  and also help students, and it's only students. And this gentleman's very kind.

It's under a thousand bedrooms. That's woefully insufficient. It's six floors shorter than the nearby University Tower. It is less than a 10x FAR. There is too much parking for cars, and there's not enough parking for bikes.  You know what's actually worse than this bad side plan? The lies that people have been telling here in opposition to it. Especially since the very resolution we are discussing just makes the lies incredibly obvious.  Oh, the site is going to be 100% powered by DTE, they say. The site plan literally includes 100 kilowatts of solar panels. My 1,000 square foot house, which is a much less energy efficient type of building than this will be, needs four kilowatts of solar panels  fully make up for my energy consumption. So this will be covering at least 25 units, probably far more just with the solar from that.  Oh, we're putting it up willy-nilly. What are you talking about? We've gone through process after process after process discussing this every step of the way. So come on, if you're opposed to this, fine. But be opposed to it for good reasons. Don't lie. Please, people.  You don't have to sink to that level. Let's talk about reality, not fantasy.

I would like to talk about the staff's main concern, which was not the density. So it's not the number of bedrooms that this thing would add, but the size of the structure. And I'm quoting, the area surrounding the site is primarily multiple family and group housing with structures of various sizes and heights, but not approaching the scale of this project.  Dot, dot, dot. It would prohibit any sort of transitional zoning or scale against the residential neighborhood to the south and east. Those comments mean or ask us to consider thoughtfully two things, the relationship of a building of this scale to its surrounding context, and whether the project provides sufficient public benefits to offset its scale.  I'm going to speak very quickly about the public benefits. These are all in the supplemental regulations. It means they are part of the zoning and they must be provided. There are affordability elements. The PUD regulations require a minimum of 15% of the total units  to be dedicated as affordable or a contribution in lieu of units, which is usually preferred by Jennifer Hall of the Ann Arbor Housing Commission. The petitioner then is required to pay $4.6 million, but has added to that a voluntary top-up of $98,000, which brings the total cash-in-lieu payment to $4.7 million, which can be leveraged up to as much to $25 to $1.  In addition to the $98,000 top-up contribution, the project will make a voluntary contribution of $50,000 to the Ann Arbor Housing Development Corporation to use for sustainability upgrades to existing or proposed AAHDC properties located in the central area of the city.  So the required 4.6 million will benefit the public, but should it count as a public benefit for purposes of justifying the zoning category for this project? And do we need other public benefits for that? There are other public benefits. I will go quickly, as quickly until I get caught up through the sustainability benefits.  The project offers a shelter-in-place community space for renters. Its generator is sized to heat common spaces. The site is located next door to an urban forest fragment.

Council Member Dish is correct in that I did an analysis about, I actually don't remember when, five, six, seven years ago, to look at how much a dollar that was  committed to the affordable housing fund, how much it leveraged in additional funds based on actual projects that utilize those funds. And the amount was $25 were leveraged for every dollar that was contributed to that fund, which has primarily been from developers, but also the city has historically put general funds into the affordable housing fund. We haven't had much contributed in the last few years. So,  I would suspect that if I did a new analysis with new funding coming in, that dollar leverage would be less than 1 to 25, just because of the increased housing costs. But I feel pretty confident, based on other projects that I'm working on, that it would leverage anywhere from $5 to $10 for every dollar that's in that fund, because that's how you fund actual affordable housing projects, where all of the units are affordable housing as you layer  multiple funding sources on top of each other.

A month ago when this came up the first time I spoke about my experience as a student living in University Towers on South University. In 2005 when I lived there, there were 39,533 total students enrolled at U of M. Last academic year there were 51,225 total students enrolled at U of M.  While the university must bear some responsibility for this problem, the reality remains that whether we like it or not, we do in fact need more housing.  As we've heard multiple times tonight, this project, the proposed project, would bring 228 new units, 733 new bedrooms to the area. There are other considerable benefits, the 26 new EV charging stations, storage for nearly 200 bikes, including two e-bike charging stations, options for ground floor retail, LEED silver, which admittedly could be improved, as we've talked about before.  but an all-electric building with no natural gas hookups, except to support a backup emergency generator, and $4.7 million to our affordable housing fund, which we just heard from Ms. Hall about how she is able to take that money and leverage it into significantly more units of affordable housing than what the developer could build in this project for the same amount of money.  You know, we heard tonight about concerns that high density, that with the growing student population, that high density housing could continue to impact nearby neighborhoods. But the reality is our housing crisis is already impacting our near campus neighborhoods.  As I mentioned at the last meeting when I was out on the campaign trail, specifically in this area, I heard from long-term residents about concerns with housing availability due to more and more houses being gobbled up by landlords to use for shorter-term student rentals, driving up housing costs, and impacting long-term upkeep and quality of the structures. This problem exists exactly because we as a city, and yes, the university, have not kept up with the need for more student-focused housing near campus.  For all of these reasons, I will be supporting rezoning tonight because this is exactly where, within a couple of blocks from campus, we need more student housing if we don't want more student housing proliferating out into nearby neighborhoods.

So, you know, firstly, I want to note and I want to acknowledge that, you know, our exclusionary and racist zoning laws have prevented us from building more dense housing in a variety of ways and have helped to bring us to where we are today.  We also, as Council Member Rodina stated, must acknowledge that despite the many benefits that U of M provides our community, the university's exponential growth of staff, students, and others has significantly contributed to our housing crisis. We simply do not have enough housing supply to meet demand. This project is in alignment with our climate action goals, our goals to make housing more affordable in our city, to be a more welcoming and equitable community,  And, as Jennifer Hall stated, it will provide funds to build more affordable housing. And, very importantly, it will provide an opportunity to create a more accessible, walkable, and bikeable neighborhood. The Brookings Institute found last year that removing zoning barriers and increasing housing density has positive effects on rent stabilization, especially in areas with constrained housing supply. This will help to fight our housing crisis.  And the U.S. Energy Information Administration reports that carbon emissions in cities with higher density are less than in more remote suburbs. This is very, very helpful in regards to the climate crisis. We're at a critical point in our climate crisis fight. We're predicted to be a state that's going to have a mass number of climate refugees. We need to make choices to make more housing available or it's going to impact all of us.

A lot of what I wanted to say has been said, so I won't repeat some of those points. But I did want to acknowledge staff's thoughtful professional analysis and perspective on this PUD, while also acknowledging that it was very different from where Planning Commission landed. Like Councilmember Rodino, I lived in this area of town when I first moved to Ann Arbor in 2003, so I'm very familiar with its area.  It's convenience as a location for students to live, as well as how it abuts against single-family homes. You know, I guess I wanted... Councilmember Rodinez spoke about the growth in our enrollment in the time that he's lived here. I wanted to speak more recently to the amount of students that have been added in recent years. So, 4,500 students.  only 1,000 new on-campus student housing units have been built in recent years. Private development has added approximately 2,000 new units. So in other words, we are short of housing. Our rental vacancy rate is essentially zero. Rents continue to climb. U of M enrollment continues to grow at approximately 2% a year or about a thousand students.  So this development would add 733 bedrooms. You know, student enrollment's growing by 1,000 a year. So I just want to put that in perspective. This isn't going to fill a need by itself, but it certainly is part of the solution. I think for this PUD, we're being asked, you know, to consider how it would be advantageous to the city.  And that's a value judgment. So here is mine. Housing fund, the amount is significant. I think we just heard about how those funds can be leveraged in a better way by giving the money to the housing commission rather than building units in this building.  all electric, LEED Silver certified, thermal bridging to increase efficiency of the building envelope, and last but certainly not least, bringing desperately needed housing close to campus, other developments of its kind, amenities, and transportation lines. That's enough for me to say it's advantageous to the city.  When I hear words like protect, character, preserve, maintain, infringe, financial impact, property owners, I am really concerned that they're indicative of values that prioritize keeping things like they are rather than meeting this community's very real housing needs next to campus that continues to grow.

So, to add to more numbers,  U of M has built just two dorms in the past 30 years, North Quad and Munger, and those added about 1,000 new beds. In the same time period, if my calculations are correct, they've added 15,000 more students. Now, we've talked about how much the private market has added as well in terms of new beds. Now, U of M is trying to rectify this decision to some degree, and they did this by  deciding to build a new dorm near Elbel Field, and they're doing that by acquiring private property that's currently contributing to our tax base and taking it off the tax rolls. Obviously, it'll provide much-needed new housing, but it's also going to cause other difficulties for our city, and we as a policymaking body do need to take this into account.  I understand the concerns of neighbors and and also staff who are rightfully looking at our current but outdated plans The consolidated land use element of the city's master plan was adopted over a decade ago, but this plan And while it's been reviewed, it's basically it was built upon recommendations that came  mostly about 30 years ago. The central area plan that informed that is a 1992 central area plan. The reality is our plans are very outdated, which is why we're going through a comprehensive update right now. But we are stuck at this moment of time where we have an outdated plan.  Significant housing scarcity and we were presented with a project That helps to address this Now it's important. You know, we have to identify as a body whether or not this truly has the community benefits that justifies a pretty large ask for our community and so each of us is individually having to decide that and that's difficult to do especially in the face of recommendations from our staff, but  Looking at this myself.

Which will help fund our critical our general fund which also funds basic services for our city So these are the calculations that I need to make Recognizing that it's maybe not a perfect project and there's maybe not a perfect answer here But these are the issues that we're wrestling with as a community So I'll be voting in favor of that further discussion councilmember dish"}, {"start": 13163.006, "end": 13293.679, "speaker": "SPEAKER_11", "text": "It's always terrific to hear my colleagues deliberate.

And so it will be great if this building manages to do it because it will be an example that we can point to on Planning Commission and Council  and say, yes, it can be done if you had the right incentives to do it. And so I think that that's valuable. OSI has pointed out that this building may be Ann Arbor's first high-rise electric building, but it won't be one of the first nationally.  Michigan state law makes it more difficult to build this kind of building here. So I think that we value this.

It also accords with the current policy on parking, which no longer requires parking minimums. The developer will not be adding parking.

Alexis DeLeo, Planning Department.  We've had a question with two parts. The first part is what was the change to increase units without increasing the basic footprint and volume represent apologize. What does the change represent Is it because the developer change their mind and about what to offer.  We know that the developer offered the planned condominium units in this building B for presale for some period of time, but did not get enough potential owners to meet their own criteria and chose to change from an ownership format to a rental format. That change alone does not trigger the need to change zoning.  that is outside of the parameters of site plan approval. And then the applicant has told us directly that the apartment units necessarily have a smaller floor areas than do the condos, and that they are striving to adhere to the physical parameters approved for building B in keeping with the spirit of the rezoning. And so that's why they have a virtually identical building mass in terms of absolute floor area, setbacks in height, and the same architectural design.  Other than the changed shape and the increase in unit count, the proposed changes to the site plan pertain to floodplain mitigation and parking reduction, and that comes specifically from the different first floor design, going from a podium shape to a U shape. The second part of the question was, what gets reported in a transportation impact analysis, and what are the potential outcomes of that analysis?  This answer response has been provided primarily from our transportation staff, and they say that multimodal transportation impact analyses determine how the transportation system is currently operating, identify any concerns with the current transportation system, and develop an understanding of how the transportation network will be impacted by or appropriately serve the new development.  The multimodal transportation study investigates all modes of travel for quality, level of service, as well as safety operations as identified in the ITE manual, that's the Institute for Traffic Engineers. Potential findings include, not limited to, the vehicle level of service is or is not affected, sidewalk gaps that impede the ability to travel to and from the site as a pedestrian,  Transit stops that are or are not ADA accessible, bicycle and pedestrian quality level of service is currently below desired levels, if so, and the impacts the proposed development will have on the safety performance or outcomes of an intersection or corridor, which is especially critical at locations identified as already having safety needs by the A2 moving together plan.  Generally, transportation staff say they do not have major concerns with this site, but would like to answer multimodal and safety questions. For example, there are new signals in the area, as well as a new roundabout, which are different than when the project was initially presented. Operational evaluation was requested and would ideally have been presented during staff review.  Although vehicular impact is not expected to change, this project did not update impacts to the non-motorized travel, transit, or safety measures, those components of the traffic impact study. The original TIA traffic impact analysis was produced before our local safety plan was produced, so there is not recognition about tiered safety locations.  And finally, I do want to mention that planning staff acknowledge the transportation team has recommended denial of the project as the applicant didn't provide the multimodal traffic analysis of the project, instead relying on the vehicular traffic analysis model from the original site plan.  But the planning team is recommending approval of the site plan regardless, as we would not have been able to conclude that any outcome of the non-motorized analysis would impact level of service standards identified in the Unified Development Code, which is the lone standard for approval or denial of a traffic impact analysis.

Today, just a day after our city celebrated Juneteenth, I want to underscore a topic that has been long tied with our shared history and the concerns of those doing business, visiting, and living in the city of Ann Arbor. The lineage of American policing finds its origin in an institution we have spent centuries trying to overcome, slavery.  Historically, slave patrols in the antebellum South bore the responsibility of apprehending runaway slaves and thwarting potential revolts. After the Civil War, these patrols simply donned a new name, transforming into what we recognize today as formal police departments. It is crucial to remember that this metamorphosis was not without consequence.  The patrol's legacy lingered, perpetuating disproportionate targeting and control over black people. Why did this happen? Primarily two reasons stand out. The abolition of slavery was not synonymous with the eradication of white supremacy. Several white southerners were intent on retaining their dominance over black people. And they saw the emerging police departments as instrumental in achieving this.  Moreover, these departments were deemed necessary to restore order in the post-war South, which was grappling with chaos and instability. This unsettling historical legacy manifests itself in our contemporary policing practices across the nation, and not just in the South. As evidenced by current events, Federal Department of Justice civil rights investigation findings and their subsequent consent decrees  Black people are disproportionately more likely to be stopped, searched, arrested, and tragically, fatally shot by the police. These statistics stem from the historical context of policing, which has been about control, especially over black and brown communities. We know that the history of American policing is not a relic of the past, but an ongoing narrative that we must actively shape.  The vestiges of white supremacy remain embedded in our police forces, and black and brown people continue to be disproportionately targeted. This is why I am introducing an ordinance to end low-level secondary traffic stops as one of many crucial steps towards creating a police system that is truly equitable, just, and fair for all members of our community.

It's not okay that we accept disparities in the rate at which black drivers are stopped and searched in comparison to white drivers. We know over time that singling out  one race over another. Conducting searches and behaving in this way erodes community trust in law enforcement and alienate citizens. We can and should do better, and this ordinance is a step forward. I'm proud to co-sponsor this, and I hope my peers will join us in supporting it tonight.

Um, we've talked a lot about, you know, the statistics that secondary traffic stops lack public safety benefit. That's something I do want to stress, but do cause harm, humiliate and expose communities of color to risk of violence as well as criminal criminalized poverty. Um, they also decrease perceptions of safety in the community and decreased community trust in the police.  I believe that we need other ways that we can provide assistance and resources to those who are having obstacles and driving safely. I also want to make a note that this ordinance is really an intersectional equity issue. This is also a disability issue. Those who are pulled over by police are disproportionately people with disabilities, in part because disability is overrepresented among communities of color.  43% of disabled people are arrested by the time they turn 28. 30 to 50% of people subjected to police use of force are people with disabilities. 33 to 50% of people killed by police are people with disabilities.  So the risk of this, obviously, and of being subjected to police violence increases as these identities intersect with race, class, gender, and LGBTQ status. So this approach to eliminate secondary stops is not just anti-racist, but anti-ableist, community-centered, and an equitable way that we need to approach our policing.

I know from speaking with her that while this change may seem fairly straightforward to a casual observer, it comes after hours and hours of research and is informed by lived experience and conversations with community stakeholders, ICPAC members, Interim Chief Metzer, city attorneys, fellow council members, and staff.  I also want to acknowledge that based on my own conversations about this ordinance revision that I'm personally grateful that we have a local chief who wants to be part of the solution and is working with council on reforms.

Many of my council members' colleagues have spoken to the need for this. And so that is very clear. I think to address the couple of questions that I've gotten from residents  around making these changes. I think it's important to note that there are, of course, reasons at times that one might want to have enforcement around these issues. And these ordinance changes don't prevent that from happening. A ticket can be mailed to a resident or to a driver, I should say.  who has one of these violations. And that's important to note because at times there are reasons we might want to enforce this. But there is no reason that we need to stop a driver for any of these issues. They are not issues that can be changed at the moment. They are not safety issues. And so I think we are definitely heading the right direction in terms of how we are changing our enforcement so that we can make sure that everybody is safe.

I have a few more words about this. I just wanted to add that we must acknowledge the fear, stress, and trauma black and brown communities face when loved ones are simply out driving. This fear isn't abstract or unfounded. It's grounded in a history of racial profiling, discrimination, and a disproportionate number of police violence incidents towards black people. The trauma associated with this fear is immense.  Mothers may find themselves in a state of perpetual anxiety, always worrying about their children. This constant fear can lead to conditions like chronic anxiety, depression, and even PTSD. Black children, teenagers, and adults who experience these police stops live with this trauma. Many have grown to associate driving with fear and stress rather than freedom and independence.  Every police stop, no matter how routine or minor, carries the risk of escalating into a dangerous or life-threatening situation that violates someone's civil and human rights. Additionally, the financial burden of these low-level stops can be significant. Fines and fees associated with traffic violations or other low-level secondary traffic stops can lead to financial stress.  especially for families already economically challenged. The added cost of legal representation or the burden of navigating complex legal systems without it can quickly accumulate. As we consider this ordinance, we must keep in mind the layers of fear, trauma, and financial burden associated with these low-level secondary traffic stops.  Let us acknowledge the reality of living with this fear and work towards the reform that not only respects the comfort of all of our residents, but also supports the needs of our economically disadvantaged community members. In prohibiting low-level secondary traffic stops, we take one step closer to making our city a place where all residents can live without fear and with dignity. And I need to quickly add that in rereading Section E in preparation for the first reading, I would like to move to amend the language for greater clarity  And because the current language does not fully reflect my intention with respect to tail lamps.

It's incredibly important that we, as a municipal government, assure our residents that our law enforcement focus is always the promotion of public safety, performed with professionalism, without bias or favor.  The secondary stops addressed by this ordinance are not necessary to affect public safety. Crucially, however, they unnecessarily disrupt the lives of community members. They corrode trust and confidence between PD and the community. And they thereby, and for other reasons, affect true and real hurt.

And second, we received some fairly strongly worded concerns from both Solid Waste staff and Community Standards staff, both of whom will be charged with implementing this ordinance. And Community Standards is concerned that they will receive a neighbor's complaint call about things on the curb. And in the floating 48 version, it'll be, there's no way for Community Standards to know how long the items have been out there. And so they're going to get pressure  from both sides of the conversation, both the person who complains about the stuff and the person who put it out and will say, it's only been there five minutes. And Sarah Mason, the solid waste and circular economy sort of head,  believes that a better approach would be to have the swap option available during a defined period, not only because it will make enforcement more straightforward, but it makes promoting the program as part of A20 easier. The idea is to give people new ways to shop, and so I  Scheduling this thing during a defined time period could make it easier for it to become an event. We would know, hey, weekend, I'm going to go for a walk and go for a curbside shopping spree with my friend and she can help me carry some stuff home. So putting it out there, it's, I don't, though I am friendly towards my colleagues, I don't think this is a friendly amendment.

We had just a couple questions on this item, the first being what is kind of a brief history of our engagement with the GSA on this topic. As the council will recall, there was direction from the council table to talk to the federal government about future uses for the federal building site, and in the course of those conversations, we  had more detailed conversations with them about their intention to redevelop the plaza that is in the front of the federal building. And so through the course of those conversations, we thought there might be an interesting opportunity here to partner with the GSA and envision an expanded federal plaza using either some portion or all of the right of way along the 200 block of Liberty Street.  So question two, why is this area being considered for an open street? I'll start by saying that in July there will be an item coming before the council to authorize a cost sharing agreement with the DDA for a circulation study or a sub area transportation plan for the downtown.  Part of that analysis will include looking at streets in the downtown area for open street installations or curbless streets or something like that. So the question is, why would we put a resolution forward to look at this area in front of the federal building? And the answer is, because the federal government is engaging in a design study this summer to redevelop the federal plaza.  And so the idea here is we let the subarea transportation plan for downtown move forward, the circulation study move forward, but also simultaneously engage in a process with the federal government to see what a design for such an installation would look like in front of the federal building when  These processes are underway simultaneously. When they conclude, we would bring back recommendations to the council on, you know, what we would actually do. So what this resolution directs is conversations and participation and design, but it does not actually direct the installation or removal of the right-of-way or anything like that.  So how will the community be engaged in this process? All of our projects like this in the city go through our community engagement checklist or community engagement toolbox. We will have robust engagement. I would envision discussion with downtown stakeholders, including the businesses, the merchant associations.  certainly consultation with area to moving together transportation plan which I think already answers some of the big questions about the what in terms of directionality for what the city should prioritize downtown but we would want to have more detailed conversations about the how and the when and things like that.  And then finally, what engagement is in store for the circulation study? And what is the aim of the study? Same answer on the circulation study. The A2 moving together plan has done a lot of the heavy lifting on engagement in terms of figuring out what public priorities are for the what. Engagement for the circulation study would answer on focus on the how and the when. So there will be a stakeholder committee  technical committee, there will be public communication from the consultant and you know all of that would kind of feed into a prioritization for transportation priorities downtown. And in terms of what the circulation study will cover,  The consultant, Smith Group, by the way, who also was the consultant on the A2 Moving Together plan, so they're intimately familiar with our transportation goals. They would build a downtown multimodal traffic model. They would evaluate the feasibility, conceptual plans, and costs for up to six additional bicycle infrastructure projects in the downtown.  They would create technical guidance and plan improvements for transit priority streets in the downtown, working with AAATA. There would be a study of 5th and Division, moving those two streets back to two-way traffic. And there would be feasibility for up to four pedestrian streets, shared streets, or curbless streets in the downtown area.  This resolution simply kind of puts a marker on the idea that because of the work of the federal government, we want to make sure that this concept is identified as part of the effort for our circulation study and that we don't miss opportunities to do some basic joint design work and concept work of the federal government in advance of the delivery of the circulation study."}, {"start": 15972.033, "end": 15972.613, "speaker": "SPEAKER_41", "text": "Discussion of DC2?"}, {"start": 15976.667, "end": 16086.734, "speaker": "SPEAKER_14", "text": "Councilmember Briggs Yeah, thank you and thanks for that introduction I think that is the groundwork about why the timing is is so important for us to be doing this as Folks know we've received a fair amount of feedback from downtown merchants and Main Street Area Association regarding kind of questions and concerns around pursuing a full pedestrian plaza in this area and I  I think that the case has been laid about why we're exploring this right now.

Just my gut is that this feels like just a minute of the tail wagging the dog with regard to the federal government's intentions. Main Street Area Association, of which, you know, I serve, has been facilitating, organizing, engaging, and managing the pedestrian street closures since they started in 2020.  We know from that experience that pedestrian street closures need to be on blocks with heavy engagement from the businesses, with a number of them extending into the street. Any business that doesn't have, any space that doesn't have businesses in the street quickly becomes dead space. Half that block will close at five o'clock when the government services building closes.  The GSA just isn't a destination for visitors or citizens outside of 9 to 5. Abracadabra, Afternoon Delight, Sam's Clothing, all of those close around 5 to 6 p.m. So in my mind, this is not an attraction. The closing of this particular thoroughfare doesn't make sense to me. And generally, I am in support of closing streets and making our city more pedestrian friendly.  I think it'd be silly to not point out that one block from this proposed site, we have Liberty Plaza. And we see that being adjacent to a space that's dead outside of office hours has a negative impact on that space's vibrancy. So adding a second plaza within the block of that site doesn't make any sense to me either.  Councilmember Briggs mentioned, and I appreciate that, mentioned hearing a lot from the business community who would be impacted by this. And contrary to what we hear from the experience of Main Street Area Association members on Main Street who have experienced the street closures and see that, you know, if you go to dinner, go to a bar, you're going to go shop somewhere else, they're supportive of street closures on Main Street. The businesses that we've heard from on this particular block don't see benefit to it.  And I really worry about the city's resources to activate the space so that it's not just dead after six o'clock And if we have those resources Why aren't we using them now for Liberty Plaza and for West Park and other areas within the city that we know need to be activated?

So I think  We have to think bigger than what exists there now. I think this is an opportunity to actually refigure the space. I think, yes, it would have to be designed very thoughtfully. I think what you're hearing is everybody wants a vibrant, active downtown. No one wants to create a dead space with problems. But I think that when done right,  These kinds of spaces are extremely desirable. I go downtown. The spots in our downtown that are closed to vehicular traffic are the most vibrant spaces that we have. I've been to other cities that have way more than one block pedestrianized. They are very successful. They're destinations for many people.  So, you know, this to me is directing us to engage with it. It's not a design.

Whether that includes portions or all of the right-of-way is something that we're going to be working through with professional staff, with GSA, with community members, with stakeholders, both proximate and otherwise. I'll note that there are substantial differences between a pedestrianized Liberty Street and an existing Liberty Plaza. It is plain and obvious that there is existing commercial on Liberty Street.  a place of natural transit between Main Street and State Street. And there are other differences as well. It is at grade rather than below grade, just to name a few off the top of my head. But I do want to assure folks both  in the commercial sector and the residential sector that this is a process.

I just wanted to say as someone who is particularly interested in historic architecture, I found the  historic district awards earlier tonight a little bit weird, because those buildings didn't really seem to match a reasonable definition of historic to me. Old? Yeah, sure, some of them are. Pretty and well-maintained? Mostly, yes. But being old and pretty doesn't  it isn't enough to make something historic. And I really do wish our historic district commission would spend more time preserving actual history than trying to freeze a few buildings in time when they have roughly the same historical value as my own 1960s ranch style house.  I was also a little bit disappointed to hear that the bicycle lanes on Stadium are going to be shut down entirely for the helicopter-based installation of new lights. It's quite concerning because it seems to treat people who commute by bicycle as second-class citizens over people who  commute by automobile. To the extent that this closes down one of the very few decent bike throughways in the city so as not to reduce the capacity for cars and chooses to endanger people on bicycle  in order to not minorly inconvenience people in cars.

I still want to state things that I was going to say because the police are not here to help us. Broken window policies only exist so that the state can harass those that they deem less than themselves. Historically, these people have been in the black and brown communities. Cars having wear or tear or any kind of aging  is not enough reason for the police to intervene in someone's life and find an excuse for further subjugation. I absolutely applaud this amendment for being approved because this means that the police can no longer use these existing policies to harm and take life as they did with Philando Castile. Secondly, the wonderful people who do pull over preventions can now spend that time helping their communities in other ways instead of helping the police avoid  instead of helping these people avoid the police like Sauron's eye. Has anyone ever called the cops and honestly thought they would help you find out who broke into your car? Insurance claims maybe, but not to actually solve the crime. So what makes you think that when they pull over and harass people, they say are criminals, that they're actually not just looking for an excuse to look busy? I will leave you with wisdom from words past.  Fuck the police coming straight from the underground.

Was it morning yet? It might be good morning to you all. I am happy that this ordinance did pass on tonight.  It is my prayer that no kinks pop up in his past in the second reading. And I, it is my prayer because in Washtenaw County, there is this claim to being so progressive. And a lot of times it turns into symbolism. And so it is my hope that this has the weight needed to enforce when officers will still try to do pretext stops on black and brown folks  As we see, Washtenaw County prosecutor on day one said no pretext stops in Washtenaw County, and that any contraband found would be thrown out. That has not happened. We have got calls from multiple families that are suffering because they're poor, because they had a life that was out. This is still happening with a law on the books that says no pretext stops.  So it is my hope that while I'm grateful this has been passed, that we have the meat needed to hold officers accountable when they do this. And that all pretext stops that have contraband or anything found are really thrown out. This is an assault against the black community. I can't even tell you as a black woman, I'm scared when I'm pulled over by the police. They come up to you with their hands on their guns. I have been treated horribly by the Ann Arbor police just  When the Black Lives Matter mural in Willard Park was destroyed and had this man totally act as if I wasn't there, as if I was invisible and treated me very horribly. This is the state of policing in America, but not just in America, right here in Ann Arbor. Number eight, elitist city, right? So we're asking that please don't just make this symbolism, but give it the meat needed to hold your officers accountable to actually follow this ordinance so that black and brown lives  can be safe in the Ann Arbor area.
