I wish that we were not adding a lane for cars at all, even if we were coming up with wider sidewalks, which is what's proposed in the substitute resolution today, which I certainly hope you'll pass that rather than the original proposal. But I think it would be even better if we were not widening the bridge at all.  or if we were to widen the bridge and make it, if we were widening the bridge, I want it to be clear to the new design contract that it will only be for the purpose of non-motorized transit and that we will not be widening the bridge for any car uses. Like it says in the substitute proposal, this is,  Car uses of the bridge goes against our non-motorized transit plan, our transit plan, our 820 plan, and this is the wrong time to be committing to car culture for decades to come. And so I hope that we see a version of this which  will not widen the bridge except for insofar as it's required to widen the sidewalks. And other than that, thanks for having the courage to rework the design at least some.

I'm speaking for CA1 and CA3, which award major contracts to CA Hall and Bailey Exchange. I sent a detailed email with a link to former council member Nelson's meticulous analysis. I hope he had a chance to read them. If at all possible, these contracts should be postponed until a thorough evaluation is made. The four contracts described in my email illustrate how flawed implementation of our best value policy has already potentially wasted almost $1.6 million in just eight months.  over competing qualified lower bids and appears to have chilled competitive bidding. This is real money. Failure to ask hard questions would be the height of fiscal irresponsibility. Ask yourself this, what are we getting for that $1.6 million? I recognize the community voted to approve best value. I had mixed feelings about it then and unfortunately it looks like some problems raised then have now occurred. It's your responsibility to deal with them. Look at the CA Hall contract. It's $755,000, three quarters of a million.  Higher than the low bid. Staff's using a five-factor scoring system for awarding contracts. I'll leave aside for now the issue of weighting items like worker development equally with cost and qualifications. Let's look at the detail. TA Hall scored 83, the lower bidder 80. That small scoring difference was a four-point difference in social equity and sustainability.  Ask this, what was that based on? Then ask, what are we getting for that $755,000? There might be good answers, but those questions need to be asked. Next, look at the August 837,000 AZ-SHMINA contract, 279,000 higher, 50% higher than the low bid. AZ scored 74, the other bidder 67. The difference was local workers and apprentice program and better benefits, nice things."}, {"start": 560.487, "speaker": "SPEAKER_05", "text": "But consider this, you get bids for a house renovation, $300,000 local contract, another bid, $200,000. Tell me, would you pay the extra $100,000, 50% higher, assuming, of course, you can afford it? If not, why should we? If the spread was close, it makes sense, but not 50%. On the Bailey contracts, unlike the typical multiple bids on large contracts of this type, this time Bailey was the only bidder. Last year, if you remember, Council Members Iyer and Rodina twice convinced you  to override staff recommendations to hire lower bidders in favor of Bailey. Two well-established local contractors with lots of past city jobs have said since they might not even spend the time and dollars working up bids if this process like that continues to be used. I can't blame them. And now it looks like no one wants to even compete with Bailey. So it appears in less than a year, implementation of best value has resulted in potential  much higher bids, $1.6 million, $2.5 million on an annual basis, and has completely eliminated competitive bidding of the work that Bailey likes to do. Who knows how much that will eventually cost us."}, {"start": 648.068, "speaker": "SPEAKER_11", "text": "Thank you. Good evening. This is Tom Stolberg calling from Lowertown in Ann Arbor. We're calling in about C1. And I hope you've all read the very thorough report. So I just want to make a mention from page 19 of that report about the Robert and Irma Hayden House Historic District.  The Robert and Irma Hayden House Historic District Study Committee finds that the proposed Historic District, Robert and Irma Hayden House Historic District, sounds redundant, has significant under National Register of Historic Places, Criterion B, as it illustrates the lives of persons significant in our past within a local, state, or national historic context.  I support this and hope that you'll vote in favor of this. We do have some other single resource districts within our city, Northern Brewery, Cobblestone Farm come to mind. This is a wonderful way to recognize, not just preserve, but recognize architecture and people and the history of our community. We have our bicentennial coming up in 2024. So I'm hoping that there'll be some other recognition similar to this  that will be highlighted as part of that as well. And by the way, I was on the Historic District Commission for six years, Chair for two, and on the Board of Cobblestone Farm for two years. So I speak from that perspective, but I speak here supporting this as an individual person.  I'd also like to thank the last caller for their remarks on that particular item. I believe two items, maybe. And I also want to speak about CA9. And I suggest that you pull this for discussion from the consent agenda. I'm not against it, but I think the discussion of it would be valuable to everybody. We have a $2 million contribution to the Affordable Housing Fund as part of the TUD, and they're looking  actually have 15 units on site, which would be the right math, I'm guessing. And the question is, as a community, what do we prefer? Do we prefer to have the units on site when we have these type of developments, or do we prefer the money paid in lieu? Rather than me telling you right now, I think the discussion  Should be opened up and let's hear from you and it probably is an ongoing discussion Recently announced was the five corners PUD a state and package and they're going to be paying a few million dollars affordable housing fund So if we'd rather have the units on site or not, that's the 30 seconds and some and something that's a community and you as our representatives I should be communicating with the developer about I  People know from my past speeches that I am a proponent of flexible development options, including but not limited to PUDs.

Good evening, my name is Peter Lutzman, and I'm the president of Scenic Michigan, a nonprofit organization here in the state of Michigan. Contrary to some of the other people who are here and who I've heard this evening, I'm not here to whine, I'm not here to complain, I'm not here to gripe, and I don't want anything from you folks. To the contrary, I'm here to present Scenic Michigan's Scenic Hero Award.  This award is given in recognition to someone, an individual, a company, a group, who signifies a lasting contribution to the preservation, the protection, and the enhancement of the scenic character here in Michigan.  on its roads, in the environment, in its communities. And this year's award goes to Council Member Erica Briggs. Erica came to my attention about five years ago as she applied for the position of Executive Director of Scenic Michigan. And I was very concerned when she applied because I looked at her resume.  And her resume showed that she was a community activist. She was involved in biking, not the Hell's Angel type, but in biking. She was a runner. She was a camper. She was a cook. She was a traveler. She was a mother and a wife and an academic, having completed her master's and was working on her PhD.  But as it said, if you want a job to get done, give it to a busy person. And we did. And I'm very glad that we did. During her time as executive director, Erica monitored state and federal litigation.  the lawsuits that are filed by the billboard companies against municipalities that regulate the billboards and signs. She participated in developing of local ordinances and state legislation. She spread the word about Scenic Michigan in person, in the media, and electronically.  and she organized and promoted our Scenic Michigan photo contest."}, {"start": 1014.576, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "text": "And if you're interested, submit your photographs to our contest also.

So, as a manager and the attorney knows, it's much easier to follow, or the administrator, it's much easier to follow a mediocre person than it is a  excellent achiever. So now our new successor to as Executive Director has some pretty big footsteps. I was going to say shoes, but I can't do that. Some pretty big footsteps to follow. For all of this, all of these reasons, and for the loyalty and devotion that she has shown to Scenic Michigan, I am pleased to announce that the Scenic Michigan Board of Directors  has designated Erica Briggs as this year's scenic hero.

Thank you for the opportunity to come up here and speak. I won't be long. I said everything I had to say in my letter. Did everyone get one? And when I looked up on the internet, I seen Miss Erica Briggs.  and her bio that she's an activist, you know, out in the community, and I liked that. I apologize for some names on here that I put, because I didn't know. Mr. Matthew and Miss Carrie, I just assumed they was part of your committee when I was Googling. But I did get two right, Miss Erica and Mr. Christopher. So I'm good with that. And so I just want to say is I'm a mother that's very determined. I raised a lot of kids of my own.  And I had to get creative raising those kids and make them happy. And so I gave you a copy of my news article that I made down in Muskegon. And it was big and popular. I drew 500 to 600 kids. I mean, it got so popular that people just got comfortable and dropped all they little ones at my house. And so I just like helping, making an impact on people.  My struggles don't stop me from having a warm heart. I'm not here to ask for anything, but what I am asking, I don't know how Ann Arbor do their little thing as far as blocking off the streets. I've been riding and looking, and I seen one street called Arbordale off a stadium that possibly could be blocked off in the summertime with children's activities and everything, right next door to where Louis's Jewelry  used to be, and they just recently moved. I also went in there and spoke with them about the idea, and they thought it was beautiful. Anything they can do to help me, they'd be willing. Guy rolls down there on Dexter and Stadium. I just don't know which end would be legally to block off. But they also was very supportive. So I'm a woman. I'm not afraid to move around and reach out and talk and speak. I had all those kids, so I had to speak.  and keep up with everybody and that's it. If someone could let me know if I'm able to do this and I get it going on every year and make everybody happy, children and families and uniting everybody and making everybody have fun. I would like to connect with Ms. Erica Briggs on some ideas if that's possible. My name and number is on here, give me a call please.

Hello Ann Arbor, I'm not here to talk about that but I am standing in front of our mayor here who was at the  January 12th event where Ms. Camilla Harris was here to talk about global warming and how they are intrigued to fix the planet. I ask you, this mayor has been sitting here watching Gelman Dioxin grow by leaps and bounds.

I wonder if Mr. Mayor heard the voices of Michigan students who protested outside of the Rackham Auditorium, saying, not a nickel, not a dime, no more money for Israel's crime. Mr. Mayor, did you hear them?  Answer me, did you hear those students saying not a nickel, not a dime, no more money for Israel's crime? Because the same students passed resolutions saying no more money for Israel. The same students have been coming here demanding  something to be done about this apartheid state of Israel.

There are children in Palestine who are dying, and you continue to ignore them while you tell us you care about Ukrainians. You're a liar. You're a racist.

Since January of 1984, this  racist Ann Arbor City Council has thrown all its weight against every resolution that would cut aid to Israel. And you see Israel massacring Palestinians by the thousands.  by the hundreds, by the dozens, by the ones, twos and threes almost every day. You see, Israel has just appointed has just appointed a national security minister named Ben Gavir, who is in charge of the Israeli police in Israel and in the occupied West Bank.

Larry Hunter was not wrong to push for a resolution to boycott the apartheid state of South Africa.

And in terms of CA9, I support this proposal, this action, and like when developers put forward affordable housing options. I think this is the best course moving forward.  What I really wanted to talk about was the library lot. And I wanted to echo some of Dan Adams's commentary from a few weeks ago and the proposals that he is pushing forward. And I will also be writing some email to city council expressing my views on what should happen with the library lot.  I think that Ann Arbor City Council should put forward proposals to either modify or replace the amendment to the city charter from 2018 and I I'm a fan of  putting money and effort into improving Liberty Plaza because that is our commons too.
