So, as I was saying, I understand why you  might want to dissolve the Brownfield Plans Review Committee tonight on the basis of efficiency and a streamlined process. And I agree with that general aim. Right now developers pass through a convoluted review process that's inflexible and needs fixing. But the Brownfield Committee is not part of the problem. And as I was saying, I checked and over the last ten years the committee has met exactly twelve times. Barely once a year on average. Sometimes some years not at all. This is not a burden.  Brownfield plan oversight is critical, not so much the site remediation activities. These are vetted by technical experts, but the non-environmental activities need close scrutiny. Here the city is using the Brownfield plan not to clean up a site, but rather to advance other goals.  It's sometimes appropriate to reward developers with a brownfield tax credit for doing something non-environmental that benefits the public. But this is tricky. There is no clear line between a useful tax trade-off and a taxpayer giveaway to the developer. We need to be mindful of bad policy, overpaying, and favoritism. Staff negotiates these deals out of public view so they require sunlight.  And once adopted, TIF tax credits are invisible. They don't show up in property tax bills, on millages, or in the city budget. The affected government entities, city, county, school board, district library, and mental health, often don't even know that they're missing the millage revenue, which can run into the millions just for non-environmental. The city is effectively deciding for all these entities. That's another reason for strict oversight.  So these plans, especially the non-environmental elements, need careful scrutiny on the front end. That's why council voted unanimously in April 2003 to establish the review committee. Please keep it intact. This is a very capable city council. But you simply do not have the time or the bandwidth at your meetings to fully vet these complex and opaque plans.  You may argue that the city's brownfield policy, adopted in 2019, reduces the need for review. In fact, it adds a layer of complexity that makes separate review even more important. By dissolving the committee, you are also eliminating one of two chances for public comment. In conclusion, this committee poses no burden  and provides needed oversight for the discretionary removal of millions in taxpayer dollars from the tax rolls for non-environmental purposes.

I was enlightened by Ken Garber's description of the Brownfield Plan Review Committee's infrequent meetings. I think I've been to two of those 12 meetings over the span of the last 10 years. I remember waiting a long time for minutes for some of them.  One of the things that I think he brought up and I'll repeat is just the relatively light administrative burden for this committee relative to the relatively large sums being expended on brownfield remediation and the tax dollars that go with that.  A couple hours a year of oversight and a couple hours a year of listening to public commentary on these sorts of efforts seems like a good investment.  The challenge with brownfields is that as a city we tend to forget what came before us. We forget that there was a chemist living at and doing his chemical experiments at what is now the Science Center. We forget where all of the landfills and dumps were. We just forget. People from a hundred years ago are not around now to tell us.  where not to go. And so we're rediscovering or discovering, or like some people know of course, but most people don't, just how expensive it is to take land that we've destroyed and bring it back up to a space where it can be reused. And I think just for the public stewardship of the land that's under the city's orbit, I think it's a good idea to keep this  keep this function visible. I did look for other organizations that also have brownfield oversight, and I did find the county, which does a pretty credible job of meeting on a regular basis and reporting on, on a regular basis, their efforts. An equivalent web search of the city website was not as anywhere near as useful. So I guess the request is if you're  If you're going to decide to remove the review committee, my ask would be please put a mandate to report out on brownfield activities on perhaps an annual basis to describe the locations under use and the funds expended or not collected and make sure that people can keep tabs on bad decisions of the past and hopefully remediate it in the future.

Consider the first choice, I'm sure you all have. What happens if one of you says publicly that there might be some merit in Henry's words?  Words to date that have not been challenged.

I'm here to speak in favor of the unarmed crisis response and wellness check proposal with a personal story, a story of mental health. My wife and I married in 2018 and enjoyed two years as newlyweds, then COVID hit. In quarantine and also working from home, we spent 24 hours a day and seven days a week together for years.  Through counseling, we also learned that both my wife and I suffer from severe childhood trauma. For everyone in this room who has had a relationship or is in a relationship, I think can respect the fireworks that that recipe just cooked up. In the fall of last year, an argument rose to crisis level. For the first time, I was scared.  It was late on a Sunday evening when neither one of us could reach our counselors. I felt so over my head I called 911. A friend had recently told me about unarmed crisis wellness checks. I asked the dispatcher, please send an unarmed response team for a wellness check. 30 minutes later, three police cars arrived. We both cooperated, but I believed I was asked leading questions while in a vulnerable state for the purpose of making an arrest.  I don't fault the police. They were extremely compassionate and helpful. But because my wife had self-harmed and because I had a small cut and a bruise, my wife was arrested. But this is not a story with a sad ending. My wife and I got the counseling, we're in a great place together, and we're overcoming a lifetime of childhood trauma together. We've learned to support each other and are in a functioning and healthy marriage.  Spending the night in jail was extremely traumatic for my wife. It was also costly. Legal fees, logistics, hotel rooms, court costs put expenses over $10,000. But I can never erase the vision of my wife being walked to a patrol car in handcuffs, especially when I feel unarmed mental support was all I was calling for.  Although the case was dismissed, my wife still has an arrest on her record and I now fear for her citizenship. I loved reading the report.  On the unarmed crisis support team's status, last year it looked like money from the Federal American Rescue Plan Act was directed to the program. And according to a group called the Coalition for Revisioning Our Safety in Washtenaw County, that funding would allow the program to operate for the first year. Could that be the beginning?

The previous speakers have done a wonderful job of covering many aspects of this. So I'm going to broaden what I'm going to say about it into what I see as a pattern, a pattern of deregulation and reduced oversight.  Now, I'm an entrepreneur, I'm a capitalist, I believe in capitalism, but I believe in regulated capitalism. I don't want the Wild West in capitalism, and I don't want the Wild West in government. Government has a role to play. As one of the speakers said, you are our representatives. Whenever you reduce the amount of oversight, public scrutiny, public hearings,  public information as provided. It reduces that window of the public, of the people you represent, of the citizens of Ann Arbor, into how our government works. This particular item has to do with a lot of money and a relatively infrequent amount of time that society needs to meet.  But it's very important. The whole function of the Southfield TIF aspect of cleaning up sites, especially orphan sites, is very valuable to get sites cleaned up that otherwise might not. But a lot of money changes hands. A lot of money, tax dollars, are involved. Public scrutiny should be not just allowed, but embraced.  Journalism is reduced these days, we all know that. Therefore, we need more public scrutiny, not less public scrutiny, whenever we have the opportunity. I believe dissolving this committee reduces the public scrutiny, reduces your helping us to have a window into how government works and how government deals with our tax dollars.  There have been some good things that have come out of the Brownfield tip in my neighborhood, in the Lower Town project. Unfortunately, $9 million of affordable housing went by the wayside with an improper decision. In the Brownfield tip, 15 units, 15 units of affordable housing. We lost 93, but we got 15 in a Brownfield negotiation. Just one small example of where a council member was proud of what he felt he negotiated.  into a brownfield active group financing situation.

I don't think I, I mean, I know I didn't ever vote for a water or stormwater increase in my four years on council. And Mr. Mayor has been here since 2014. And along with all the other changes we've seen in our community since 2014, this will put us on track.  to have a doubling of our water rates and our storm water rates by the end of the next fiscal year. So I don't know how many of you do any kind of investment or have ever heard of the rule of 72, but when you go 6, 7% every year, 10 years, you're doubled. And that's where we're at. Now, we're not producing twice as much water. We're still doing up to 19 million some gallons a day. The cost for producing that water hasn't doubled in those 10 years.  Inflation isn't running at 7%, although under the current local state and federal Democratic administrations, it certainly is pushing it this year. So why is it that we're doubling folks' water rates in less than a decade? And is there any consideration that  these constant increases in fees, fees for services and so on, that seem constant and unstoppable, aren't being considered as detrimental to our efforts to create a more affordable and equitable community. Because there's no way that you can, the city can double cost,  Add $150 million in spending to its budget, it's coming up another hearing. Double cost for water, jack up fees for every kind of service the city has to do. And say with a straight face that you're working towards equity and you care about people who live below the median income here. And I recognize that the median income here in Washtenaw County and the greater Ann Arbor area is quite high because of our relationship with the university and the fact that Ann Arbor's always been sort of a wealthy white community.  Be that as it may, there are many people in this community who struggle and I think the lineup for our assisted housing proves that. So just as you go forward with jacking up costs to live in our community, consider that there's more than one way to make it an affordable community. And one way is to not jack up costs for everybody.  The city's only responsibility, as far as I'm concerned, the number one responsibility of a municipality like the City of Ann Arbor is to provide safe, clean water.

So my house was built in 1947. And even when it was built, it was built, including the changes to code that have happened, zoning designations and height area and placement regulations that have changed since then. It was considered non-conforming.  And so when I went to put an addition on my house that didn't increase the footprint of my house in any way, but was only above the existing non-conforming footprint, I was asked to appeal their rejection of that plan by submitting an application for the Zoning Board of Appeals. Now when I called the person who administers that, and he said, I can tell by my GPS that you're about 13 to 16 inches off.  I'm looking at the historical records of your house and so on, and it's clear that you're in front of that. And every place I've ever known, any place I've ever worked, this is an administrative fix because we recognize that this happens constantly. And if you look at the ZBA records, and those of you who serve on the ZBA, you'll see that this happens constantly. People come with this, their house was out of, and they approve it. And that's what happened to me.  But on the way to that, I paid $1,000 fee for that application privilege. And I also was required to get a $1,400 stakes survey. They wouldn't accept the survey. And that I had, I had to get a new stakes survey. And that took quite a while to find someone during COVID to do that, but it was done. So $2,400 later, they went like that, which could have been done administratively. Now, I only bring that up as an example because I'm not sure people know that adding $2,400 to a very small project,  you know, could be a burden for someone. It could drag out a project. In my case, it certainly did. Should I pay a lawyer or ZBA or my architect, right? Well, when I look at the 36 pages of increases that you got coming here, including one that's real good for you, Jen, the airport unit  And we know she gave her buddy the airport contract for 30 years. Now they're going to jack up the rates he can charge. I think that's really extra special. But when I look at that 36 pages of fees that are going up between 7 and 40 percent, I certainly understand from being on that side of the table that we have to do a fair analysis of what our costs are. And we have to set the fees that way. But  If you took the time to read through this, you'd see that some of these fees are pretty astronomical and some of these changes are going to benefit people who can afford them and they're going to hurt people who can't.

I'm Kathleen Murphy, I live at 315 Linda Vista Street in Ward 5. I thank the council for giving us the opportunity tonight to make comments about the proposed budget. I speak for the organization, Ann Arbor for Public Power.  We are in the process of trying to create a public electric utility to replace DTE because it uses mainly fossil fuels to produce its energy and thus stands in the way of allowing Ann Arbor to reach its goal of net zero carbon emissions by 2030. It also has had terribly unreliable service this past winter.  We'd like to put a placeholder, that is, Ann Arbor for Public Power, we'd like to put a placeholder in the budget of $25,000, $250,000, which would go toward the valuation of DTE's assets if the feasibility study, which the council authorized and funded, and is expected to be completed in June, looks positive.  In other words, if the feasibility study looks positive, then the next step would be to have a more precise valuation done of DTE's assets. We anticipate, after talking with cities that have undergone the creation of public electric utilities, that this would be the cost, $250,000. Since we won't know the results of the feasibility study until June,  but the budget needs to be passed in two weeks, we're asking for a placeholder in the budget to ensure that funds are available. If the feasibility study comes out to the council's liking and they want to go ahead with the valuation study, they would have then the money to do it. This is a relatively small ask in what has come to become a very large budget.

And since I believe this is the only public hearing on the budget, which is just kind of shocking, because 2018, I had to work in the fall of 2018 with the budget that was approved before me, and 2018,  It was quite a bit smaller. I think it was 400, I wanna say 421 million, something like that. And this year it's 563, and I actually lost that bet. I thought it was gonna be 570. So that's not only is that $4,800 for every single person that lives in our community per year, it's a 442 million increase in only six years. That's quite a chunk of change.  Our mills are only going up 1.9 mills or whatever, and that's because of the various ballot initiatives that were passed.  If you look back at the 2018 thing, you can see they had placeholders in there for $627 million in alternative transportation funds, which is kind of shocking. I'm sure by the time this budget is done being itself in two years, it'll be $600 million, just the budget itself. So in 2018, we had $2.5 million in one-time requests. And this year, we have $4 million in one-time requests, $600,000. That's for studies. There's lots of funds carried forward. I thought that was kind of interesting. In this budget, the thing I see the most  We'll back it up one step. When I received my first budget cycle presentation in 2018, 2019, it was about 80 pages.

We got 740 full-time equivalents in 2018, 840 this year. It's really something. That's where a lot of the money's going. Now there seems to be a constant quest for revenue. We're positioning ourself for long-term impact. And this constant quest for revenue fails to, two things aren't in here, one revenue and one expenditure. The one, if we're looking so hard for revenue,  How come we didn't implement the pilot program that city council said we were supposed to appoint a committee and study a pilot program and there was even anticipated amounts of revenue coming from that. But that just fell between the cracks. And the expenditure that fell between the cracks was another council resolution that passed that said there's supposed to be money in this budget for an office of the ombuds person.

Should the feasibility study  lead you to decide to take the next step in the municipalization process. I should back up and say that I appreciate the tremendous amount of work that staff has put into this budget, especially Administrator DeHoney, but all down the line.  I think like Ms. Murphy said, this is a relatively small ask, a quarter million dollars, and not an actual allocation, simply a placeholder.  This, you may think, this strikes me as pretty affordable. And it is that way because Five Lakes is already doing much of the work in the ongoing feasibility study. Also, a lot of the infrastructure is open to visual inspection. And as a regulated utility, DTE has submitted a lot of information already to the state on asset condition and depreciation. So the system is not a black box.  As I was sitting there, I remembered something I did read in the budget documents. It's a minor point, but DTE, if I'm remembering right, is raising our street light energy rates by 14% this year, or $300,000, and an additional double-digit increase next fiscal year, FY25.  So this is more than we're asking just for this placeholder. I'm confident that a muni can deliver electricity at least as affordably as DTE and as the previous speakers have said, has the potential to acquire electricity on the wholesale market that's 100% renewable.  So I realize this is a controversial topic, but I think this is a very minor and prudent step that you can take tonight, actually not tonight, but in the next two weeks as you complete the budget, to make an allowance for this possibility.

If the feasibility study is positive, and it indicates that this would be a direction that would be financially beneficial for the city to pursue, then the next step in the process is to get a hard valuation on what the cost of DTE's assets would be, which would allow the city to then make an offer to DTE. It would help in any future legal fights over valuation. And it's just a prudent step in pursuing this process.  If we did not put this placeholder in the budget and then the results were positive, it would simply mean that we need to take the money from somewhere else in the budget rather than, and that would simply just be messy. It would be, it could be good. It would be poor governance. We hope that this is not a too controversial of a position to ask for. It seems like simply the,  It's a prudent thing to do, considering that we have this study coming out next month, and we don't know the results yet, but we know that the next step, if they're positive, would be to spend this money. When you look across the state of Michigan, across the country, you see that municipal utilities have cheaper rates, they have better reliability, and they have the ability to choose where their power comes from. With the city of Ann Arbor's climate goals, it is unrealistic to expect that we are going to be able to reach them,  with DTE as our primary power provider. Municipalization simply seems like the only realistic option to pursue the city's climate goals while having the added benefit of increasing its reliability and over time lowering its cost.

And I know that there was also a big spike in  the water infrastructure created in the 50s and 60s too, which might have, there might be some stuff with shorter life spans there. So could you kind of clarify that a little better than I, I just did?"}, {"start": 7287, "speaker": "SPEAKER_08", "text": "Sure. Um, so what I discussed, I had a slide in the budget presentation was on the age of some of our buried infrastructure. And if you look at when the infrastructure was put in and what the expected life is, you'll see over the next  decade or so the expected life reaching the terminal, its terminal point for some of our barrier infrastructure. So we need to be positioned to begin or continue replacing some of that. You'll see a lot of that in the  capital plan for the next four years or so. There are about 20 water main projects, distribution projects, incorporated in the budget, which are part of what the bond issue will be used for, again, that I'll be talking about in phase one.  We anticipate typically when we put pipe in the ground that it's going to last about 100 years. So that means we should be replacing about 1% a year to stay on top of our reinvestment needs. So that is what's driving a lot of the current and future rate projections in addition to the improvements we need to make at the water plant, which was built in the 1930s and is also reaching the end portions of its life. Thank you."}, {"start": 7401, "speaker": "SPEAKER_08", "text": "I think that's a fair statement."}, {"start": 7487, "speaker": "SPEAKER_08", "text": "I apologize if my video keeps freezing, but I can hear you all.  Similarly, with our stormwater rates, we have the capital needs are, in a lot of cases, driving what the rate increases are. And again, significant number of projects included in our capital improvement plan, obviously also associated with  the stormwater system is just managing all of the infrastructure. So those are things like maintaining the stormwater infrastructure, cleaning, surveying, and TVing to make sure that the pipes are clear and can pass the flows that they need to. But I would say that the capital needs are a significant element in terms of what's driving the rate projections.  I don't have specific projects at my fingertips but I can provide that."}, {"start": 7606, "speaker": "SPEAKER_08", "text": "Thank you. I will kick this off.  Mr. Sean and Mr. Ader are here to help support in case there's a question that I may not be able to answer. This bond is focused on projects that go through fiscal year 26. There's about 20 of them. They are all distribution system focused, so mostly water main projects. There's also some valve replacements in the distribution system.  It's typical and best practice for us to use bonds to pay for future capital projects needs like this. And the reason is that that's best practice is because  the benefits of these investments are realized by future water customers. And through the bonding process, as we pay the bonds back through our water rates, future customers are paying for that additional infrastructure. So that's typical in best practices and the reason why we use issuing debt to cover those types of projects.  We also have other tools in our toolbox besides just issuing our own by issuing bonds by the city, but we look at grant programs. We've been successful recently. In fact, we just recently was awarded one from the state of Michigan to help do some work with the water treatment plant.  address associated with our filters. We also use revolving and loan fund programs we've been successful in achieving or getting funds from recently from the state of Michigan. And we'll continue to pursue those types of options that will be available to us when we see projects that fit and we think will score well. The projects that we've identified for this water revenue bond  again, which are typically water main projects, typically do not score well through the state's ranking system. So we tend not to submit these types of projects for that type of funding. But when we're doing projects that have a larger benefit for the whole water system, those will score better through the state's ranking system and those we will continue to put through in order to get preferred  the preferred rates that are associated with the state's program. The bonds are, one other question that was raised by one of the council members was how the bonds paid back, and they are paid back through future waterways. I think I mentioned that already. The other portion of utilizing bonds is it helps us meet also our financial metrics with utility.  So we are looking at things like debt coverage ratios to make sure we can meet those in order to make sure we can maintain the bond ratings that we want so we can get good rates when we go to market. So we factor in these financial metrics also into the decisions on how much to bond for and when to also go out to the market to bond.  I guess the last thing I'll add, and Kate can open it up and see if there's any other questions, is that we did also just put out in our monthly newsletter, which is the Ann Arbor Water Newsletter, a description that you can share about the bond and the anticipated use and how we will fund it at the request of one of the council members also, so that can be shared with constituents."}, {"start": 7843, "speaker": "SPEAKER_37", "text": "Yes."}, {"start": 7884, "speaker": "SPEAKER_37", "text": "I just wanted to, since I sit on the Policy Agenda Committee, I wanted to explain a bit. This basically lines up the timing of the Policy Agenda Committee's recommendations to line up with the legislative cycle, which is every two years as opposed to every one year. So we wanted to time it with the new delegations arriving in Washington and Lansing.  And, yeah, so that's really the major portion of it. And then the other portion is that we will be soliciting input from committees and commissions from time to time rather than, similarly, rather than annually just to line up with, to better line up with the new legislative bodies, so."}, {"start": 7955, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "text": "Thanks, Mayor Taylor. Just very briefly, this is pretty straightforward in the resolution, but this is leasing our Buy Protect Sell property, better known as Maisel Farms, our Maisel property, 54 acres, the purchase of which was approved by Council in May of 2022. And this lease is just going to ensure that the stewardship of the land  as we transition ownership to a new farmer. So I really just want to thank our Greenbelt staff for all of their continued work here and to make sure that this property is taken care of and ready for a transition. So, thanks."}], "public_comments_3": [{"start": 8445, "speaker": "SPEAKER_37", "text": "Councilmember Watson I Had a constituent asked me about this during my most recent coffee hour So I you know, I posed some questions to staff and I'm gonna say I'm gonna be supporting this tonight Since the committee is only composed of four council members and there are no members of the public on this committee and  No additional expertise is added at that stage. And there's also no way for staff to know if the opinion of those four council members represents a consensus opinion of council or even the majority of opinion of council. So eliminating this commission saves staff time, and it lets the Brownfield plan be presented to the entire council at once rather than four members. And because the 2019 policy creates a framework,  Council could still disagree but you know, the debate can happen at the council table rather than in this Commission."}], "public_hearings_8": []}
