I'm here because energy is really important to me, and I'm really interested in the resolution that's being proposed. I'm really happy to see the enthusiasm, and I feel like as a city, we're moving in the right direction.  But I have a concern about, well, I'd like to say first, I really appreciate being able to talk with Dharma Ackman and Jen Iron, my reps, after the storm about many of the issues that we see in the resolution. But I do have a concern about DTE being invited to the table, that clause being invited to the Energy Commission. And I would hope that somebody could explain to me why that is and what the intent of that is.  I personally don't see that they deserve to have a seat at the table. What I would like to point out is also, and I'll get around to this, but in terms of the resolution, I think it's great to try to work with the state, but we also have an opportunity as a city to create our own municipal utility and bypass dealing with a state. And I'd like to point out the state has not been effective in regulating DTE. If you look at the MPSC,  They said themselves in an October 25th press release, 2022, over the past decades, the MPSC has issued a series of directives in response to widespread outages after storms. While there are important efforts underway, the reality is that we still haven't seen improvements in reliability and safety that Michigan customers deserve.  That's our own commission saying that. When we talk about the legislature, a report from the Energy and Policy Institute reports that 138 out of 148 state senators accept money from DTE. Governor Whitmer accepts more money than any other state elected official. We can bypass the state and work at a city level. And we have the opportunity to do that. We have the legal right to do that.  So I think that's something I'd really like to see us do. The feasibility study will show us what options we have. But I would like the clause about DTE at the table to be removed. I don't think they have acted in good faith with our state and with our city. Thank you."}, {"start": 949.591, "speaker": "SPEAKER_43", "text": "Good evening. I'm Dr. Lauren Sargent. I live on Ember Way in Ann Arbor, as I have lived here for the past 40 years. As we've all seen way too clearly the last two weeks, DTE has failed us. Thank you for taking a first step towards demanding accountability for these unacceptable electric outages.  This was completely predictable and largely preventable. DTE can be relied upon to be unreliable, and this is nothing new. Over 40 years ago, then Detroit Edison made a business decision to focus on shareholder value instead of reliability and customer service, and it shows.  One summer in the late 1980s, Detroit lost power. My healthy 93-year-old grandma sergeant became hyperthermic in the heat and humidity of August without air conditioning. She was taken to Sinai Hospital, where she lapsed into a coma and never regained consciousness.  In 2006, we experienced one of our frequent power outages in my neighborhood. My son's buddy's little sister had developed a progressive muscular dystrophy, which left her dependent on breathing equipment at night. I asked the DTE supervisor cruising through our neighborhood, can you get this family some help? Their little girl can't breathe at night without power. The reply? If she can't breathe, she should go to a hospital. That family moved away.  Last week, I found another DTE supervisor driving through a nearby neighborhood and asked, what was causing our four plus day power outage? He said, it is the trees. Tell your neighbors to trim their trees. My neighborhood has underground utilities. Our trees are not guilty.  The callous disregard for the health and safety of the customers cannot be accepted one more day. It is literally a matter of life and death, particularly in winter and summer when babies under six and the elderly cannot regulate their body temperature at a safe level, but any time of year for people who rely on electricity for medical equipment and safe storage of life-sustaining medicine.  I urge you, the council, to join with Washtenaw County and the city of Pontiac to proclaim that this pattern ends here. In 2013, the city of Lansing experienced a catastrophic ice storm with prolonged outages. The citizens called on their municipal utility that is accountable to them, the citizens, to ensure that this would never happen again. Here is the report.  outlining all the changes they made. And no, it is not just the trees. They have not had a major power outage since. These last two storms resulted in fewer than 100 of 100,000 customers out of power briefly. Accountability matters. Either we demand better or we pull the plug on DTE and take the power into our own hands. Thank you."}, {"start": 1155.854, "speaker": "SPEAKER_36", "text": "Hello, I'm Kathleen Murphy. I live at 315 Linda Vista St. 48103 in Ward 5. I work with Ann Arbor for Public Power, which is seeking to replace CTE with Ann Arbor's own public electric utility. I'd like to strongly commend Council Members Scottie Edwin, Song, and Harrison  for the resolution they put forward, quote, requesting the city administration to engage with the Michigan legislature and Michigan Public Service Commission to advance energy equity and resilience, unquote. It spells out the many ways in which we need to hold VTE accountable for its lack of reliability during the recent ice storm and during the snowstorm that followed. Hundreds of residents in Ann Arbor and in Southeast Michigan  lost power during both storms, some for as many as eight days, a few even longer. We should all be outraged at DTE's lack of preparation for these ever more extreme weather conditions. I propose one small amendment to the resolution, and that is to remove the clause stating that DTE should, quote, attend regularly scheduled Energy Commission meetings to provide updates on what DTE is doing  to improve the resilience of its infrastructure with a focus on energy justice and decarbonization.\" The Energy Commission has the power to call on DTE to speak at its meetings and to get updates at any time. To allow DTE to be always present at Energy Commission meetings gives DTE the opportunity to push forward its PR campaign to greenwash what it's doing and not doing.  So I suggest amending the resolution to remove this one clause. But again, I thank council members Ghazi, Edwin, Sung, and Harrison for putting this resolution forward. Thank you very much."}, {"start": 1299.192, "speaker": "SPEAKER_29", "text": "Thank you. My name is Greg Woodring, and I am the president of Ann Arbor for Public Power. I'm among the unlucky few who had power out for about eight days or for over eight days. I had my power restored on the ninth day of outage, and just five hours later, my power failed once again due to the snowstorm. I'm calling in because I would like to commend Council Member  Ghazi Edwin, Song, and Harrison as well for their resolution calling on greater accountability for DTE within the Michigan Public Service Commission, legislature, and at the city level. I think that it's incredibly important that we all use this tragedy, this mass power outage, to really demand change for something that has been going on for far too long.  DTE has made the strategic decision to invest in our politics rather than their infrastructure. They're the 430th utility. They're one of the most expensive utilities. And as we all just saw, they're one of the most unreliable, with up to nine-day outages followed by even longer outages that have not been fully resolved. Meanwhile, public power utilities like Lansing, Chelsea, Wyandotte all had very short-lived outages or none at all.  The difference is clear between public power and private utilities. And I think that other people across the state are looking to Ann Arbor and seeing that we have taken the steps forward to start to break free and are trying to follow in our example. It's incredibly important that we continue to move along this process to give hope to others in the state that we no longer will have to live under the rule and callous regime of DTE. So I would like to thank  the commission, the council members, apologies for introducing this resolution. However, I would, as other speakers have stated, recommend that it be amended to remove the clause, adding a permanent speaking position to the energy commission meetings for DTE. DTE has already proven that they are willing to lie about their investments in their infrastructure, bragging just a day after the outage, their shareholders about how they  saved $100 million by deferring tree trimming and plan to continue deferring maintenance to keep their budget lean, all the same time while bragging about reliability upgrades to the press. We simply can't allow them to keep spreading this type of misinformation within our city government. We need to remove their lobbying capabilities and we need to break free from them so that we can start to build a resilient and sustainable energy grid that will carry us through the climate crisis.

Derek Miller, resident of Ann Arbor on Pauline Boulevard, and also speaking on behalf of Community Action Network. There has been a widespread disruption to services for under-resourced families with pockets of outages still persisting. In fact, just two days ago, a community resident had reached out on behalf of their 89-year-old neighbor, still without power. By reaching out to our contacts at DT, we were fortunately able to get a team out there to prioritize the repair. Although this response was to the benefit of this elderly resident,  it is symptomatic of a broken system requiring clout for resolution. Loss of food security resources as well as the ability to distribute was seriously compromised and we are the largest distributor in partnership with food gathers in Washtenaw County. Scrambling to meet emerging needs in light of uncertainty of when power would return, this led to emergency actions from dozens of nonprofits as well as municipal staff to enact remediation strategies on an already stretched system.  For example, can establish an emergency food distribution distributing over 7,000 pounds of food and over $5,000 in gift cards. The city in partnership with can and other partners also set up several warming centers, including overnight warming centers, one of which was at the north side for you center, which is one of the universe few resiliency hubs. With expectations that severe weather will only become more volatile. We are far from experiencing challenges to our grid other and other life saving resources.

Mayor, council members, as you just heard, my name is Jeff Wilkerson.  the petitioner and developer for the North Maple Road Apartments project that is on tonight's new business agenda item. I'm also the founder of A2 Collaborative, a local design development firm that, along with local engineering and architectural services, played a role in the early and ongoing project design. I know that this is the first reading for this PUD rezoning,  but I wanted to take the opportunity to introduce and summarize the project and talk about some of our various features. Our team worked diligently to blend elements of sustainability, affordability, community connectivity, and also a reduced reliance on auto-related infrastructure. In fact, our design has an approximately 82% parking to unit ratio.  Not only do these design features, these are important to A2 Collaborative as a firm, but we also believe that they are valued by the community and the city of Ann Harbor. Through our efforts, I believe that we have put together a project that will have a meaningful impact on addressing the lack of housing in the city, as well as producing and allowing for units that will remain  forever affordable at a 60% AMI level. Our project is located on a major trunk line that has access to other parts of the city and the project includes a clubhouse that is dedicated to bike storage and maintenance as well as e-bike charging. The building itself will use far less energy  than a traditionally designed code built apartment complex. And we believe that this plays a role in reducing our carbon footprint and angling towards a less intensive carbon intensive future.  Our building will be all electrified. We will offset a percentage of our energy usage through photovoltaics. And we will have a built-in level of resiliency through a geothermal design that has been incorporated into the courtyard and the parking lot.

Removal of the trees and burn modification is contradictory to the maintenance of the city's urban canopy and city of Ann Arbor forest management plan. In addition, recent unusual weather events have contributed to widespread damage to other healthy trees in the Earhart Village community, Ann Arbor's citywide  and the Ann Arbor Citywide Tree Canopy. According to a 2014 health impact assessment prepared by Michigan Department of Community Health for the City of Ann Arbor Public Services Area Systems Planning Unit, a 40% tree canopy is recommended for multifamily residential areas, which now only average 21%.

I'm also a resident at air heart village. And I am opposed to the sidewalk. I don't think the city has listened to us. And I don't think our council members have represented us. Well, you keep referring back to 300 reviews that you had from local residents regarding this project from 2019, I believe it is.  at which point the sidewalk was not even a factor, and you say nobody opposed the sidewalk. Well, nobody opposed it because it wasn't even a factor in that project. So that's a ridiculous argument on behalf of the city. There's plenty of area in the existing roadway to put in two lanes of road, two bike lanes, and if you must have a sidewalk, put it in the existing area.  You said you can't move the curb. Well, I think you can. And in the way that our governor says things, move the damn curb. If you must have a sidewalk, don't impose it on the residents of Earhart village. Speed is also a factor here. And that was requested by the 300 reports that you got back from 2019. And I don't believe that the roundabouts will reduce the speed. So I am requesting that the speed limit be reduced  to 30 miles per hour, like it is on Glacier Way, as opposed to the 35 miles an hour that it is now. And I also hope that in this whole project, you address Green Hill School and our ability to exit and enter our driveway without obstruction during drop-off and pickup time.

I'm here to talk about a golf issue that we're having. My issue pales in comparison to no energy, but it's important to me and it's important to 50 other senior golfers that play at Leslie Park. In 2009, you adopted a resolution that set rates and restrictions for season passes and green fees.  Since that time, the green fees have been amended five times, each time by council approval. Season passes have never been brought forward for amendment. They remain as you adopted them in 2009. This year, amendments were made by staff that changed the original intention of the adopted resolution. For example,  Senior season passes specifically allowed we can play for senior golf the commentary section specifically says Now available for use on weekends This year Park staff changed that policy so that seniors can no longer play on the weekends We are not allowed to play at Leslie Park or  on Saturday and Sunday, unless we pay the daily fee, or by a full season pass, which costs $400 more, or a 67% increase. Seniors are the only ones impacted with these cost increases. That is not right. The change, I believe, is not in line with the original intention that council adopted in this resolution.  The second change that was made was to limit the use of a full pass. A full pass allowed users to play seven days a week anytime. Now Parks is saying you cannot play on weekends until after 12. You would think that's no big deal. But the resolution specifically states it's a full pass. It does not allow for restrictions. For me, the cost I estimate to play on the weekends, because I play in the mornings, will be $1,500.  I will gladly pay that, but I'm going to pay that somewhere else if I have to, because I feel that passionate about the change that has been made that it is not right. And again, the change to the full pass does not meet the original intention of the resolution that you adopted. Another change is the original resolution included monthly, senior, full, and weekday passes. Those have not been offered in the four years that I've been in Ann Arbor. I don't know where they went.  The resolution you adopted allows it, but they've disappeared. I think they need to be reinstated and offered to the golfers as allowed by the resolution. I believe that the resolution binds the park staff to offer what was presented and approved. Staff should not be allowed to change the original intent of any resolution that you adopt.  The changes currently made by parks were never presented to the public, and we hope that you do something about trying to get these back in order.

I reside at 782 Greenhills Drive and represent Earhart Village Homes Association as its president.  I want the council to be advised that Earhart Village in no manner, shape or form proposes or provides that the city of Ann Arbor with any permission to trespass onto our private property for the construction of a contemplated and unwanted sidewalk. A properly circulated and documented petition of over 100 residents of Earhart Village has been formally submitted along with the board resolution  and narrating cover letter objecting to the subject sidewalk. We asked the clerk to accept the petition and the accompanying documents. Bearheart Road needs to be repaved. It just doesn't need to have a sidewalk to nowhere built, which would be a dramatic waste of city resources and will ultimately lead to significant damage to the property of Bearheart Village.

Notwithstanding, we would rather collaborate with the city for an amicable solution and invite all parties to a meeting to reconsider the existing plan. I'm most concerned about the fact that we have attended all the community meetings regarding this project, beginning in April, 2019 through December, 2022, to express our opposition to the construction of this sidewalk.  We have written to the mayor, to the city attorney, the city administrator, the public service manager, planning manager, council person, and others, and no one, not one person has responded to us.

We pay our taxes. Where is our representation?  We believe the sidewalk is unnecessary because the sidewalk already exists on the other side of the street. And there is no requirement in Ann Arbor for sidewalks on both sides of the street. You've already heard about the many gaps that would exist between the Pine Gray streets in front of Botsford Cemetery and on our conservation easement. And we do not believe that the 1972 sanitary sewer easement previously granted  gives the city the authority to construct on our private property. Our ISA certified arborist noted in his recent inspection that not only will an unsightly retaining wall be required due to the grade, but removing large tree roots can make our remaining trees unstable and a hazard to the homes behind them. The construction activity will stress the remaining trees, making them susceptible to insects and diseases, causing death and decline.

I live at 621 5th Street, and I am an environmental commissioner, but I'm speaking for myself tonight. I want to encourage all households and businesses to contact the Michigan Public Service Commission, because as you're considering in the resolution DC-5 tonight, electricity is an essential service, and DTE does not deserve the requested rate increase that it has made.  In our house, we experienced two back-to-back power outages in the last two weeks, triggered by ice and wet snow, but actually caused by poorly maintained DTE infrastructure. DTE admits that it deferred maintenance in its 2022 year-end earnings conference call. You can find it by Googling its earnings conference call and see pages 10 and 11, on which deferred maintenance is highlighted as a feature of earnings for 2022 and is planned for 2023.  We're lucky here. We were cold, but safe and concerned. We only had 80 hours without electricity over the two events. I witnessed firsthand a wire that dropped to the ground behind our house on Friday, March 3, that sparked throughout the night until noon on Saturday. Firefighters assessed the situation early on, determined that it was not critical, and called DTE. It wasn't to be a repair. A DTE safety staffer sat in a car idling  at the head of a dead-end street watching it to the wire to be sure that people did not approach the unsafe wire. At noon on Saturday the power was cut and the repair of power was completed 24 hours later on Sunday. We heard about people's loss of work expenses for spoiled food and obtaining food that did not need to be cooked during the outage as well as costs for hotel rooms when available many of which were priced excessively. Please add the cost of Ann Arbor firefighter time that was not available for other fire emergencies in the city  due to the need to check on the many downed hot wires, the cost of warming centers, and other emergency services in the city. Those costs add up and they should be charged directly to DTE. We appreciate the service of all the technicians and electricians who helped return our power. We're not pleased with how DTE management appears to depend on ignoring maintenance to gain the financial return for its investors and simultaneously ask for higher rates.  In Bridge Magazine, it's reported on February 10th that DTE asked the MPSC for permission to increase its yearly revenues by $62 million, representing a 14% residential rate increase. At the same time, DTE reported a $1.1 billion gain to its investors. What the heck? Search for MPSC on the eDocket. Once on that page, search for case number U21297.  click on submit comment and tell the MPSC to deny the rate increase requested by DTE and set a procedure to make DTE accountable to its customers ahead of its investors.

My name is Jeff Hainer. I live in Ward 1. Most of you know me. I've met most of you, not all of you. I'm going to speak to all three of these public hearings tonight because it is that important as the previous speaker pointed out. But this first one is all about zoning. And this zoning, this R4C that this is being requested for is as bad as the R  are one that it came in as when it was annexed in from the township. And I think it needs to be made clear to everybody, the public and the council, that this developer has no right to this zoning request. It's a request and we definitely have the right to say no to something like this, especially if it's not what we're looking for. And as the previous speaker made quite clear, it certainly isn't what we're looking for.  The concerns that I've heard in the community that, well, if we don't give them this, they'll do a buy right R1C, I think that that's an unsubstantiated consideration. This council has made so many efforts, substantial efforts, to do away with R1 zoning that I would hope that you would defend against R1 zoning going on this site. This needs something better. This needs a new zoning designation that we should have put in place when we redid our master plan, which is now called the comprehensive land use plan, thankfully. And we should have redone that plan  2018-2019 for various reasons that got delayed and we didn't. Saying no to this zoning request is an opportunity to reconsider and correct the past's vision, our vision of the past that's reflected in a tired and inappropriate zoning designations. What is left in our master plan, our comprehensive land use plan, is just been rehashed and rehashed over and over.  And it's not what we need. It's not what we needed 20 years ago even, but we're going to let that go. So I think it's very important that we say no when a bad project comes before us and give ourselves the opportunity to correct errors we may have made in the past or just write the ship of state as new information comes to light. I'd like to see a better zoning designation for R4E and E for environmental.  Now, there's so many things that are wrong with this. If you read the staff report on just the zoning, how it's going to destroy the already terrible intersections around it, how it's going to add to traffic, how it's going to be a big carbon waste because we don't have the proper zoning in place.  The thing that's shocking to me about this is this represents more than a quarter of the area of our downtown, and it is twice the size of the original University of Michigan campus. And to think that that would go unplanned or planned by a developer who's just going to shoehorn something in that doesn't even belong in a cornfield, Northfield, no offense, into our fine community, really essentially 80 acres here because they own the other adjacent parcels, it's a tragedy.

And yeah, we haven't reached out, and we haven't done a proper partnership with the townships, and we haven't done proper planning in a regional way. But that's neither here nor there. We don't build it here. They're still building in the townships, because I get dozens and dozens of contracts lined up all through next year to repaint the builders' paint in these beautiful houses they're building out there, and also apartments and townhouses. We need housing. We need housing everywhere. I don't think that's a surprise.  The whole planet does. But not all housing is alike, and the city of Ann Arbor has prioritized its housing. This site doesn't have, this site has, it's typical, it's actually, I had some friends from other communities who follow council as closely as I do, and they wanted me to come up here and say this is an insult to this city and the residents, this project, no offense to the developers. This site has no net zero housing. This site has no low income housing.  It has no affordable housing. The site has no senior housing. It has no ADA accessible housing. It has no cooperative housing, no live-work housing, no group housing. We deserve better. This site plan is... I think the most offensive thing to some of my former constituents and my friends and neighbors at Arrowwood is the way that this is packed and clustered next to Arrowwood, that the large apartment units are massed  right up against the Arrowwood facility. But there's no notion of connecting those communities or creating cooperative communities. It's just a way to stuff the houses on this property. And the folks who say that perfect shouldn't get in the way of the good should recall that in many instances, we have said no to the not perfect and gotten better. And the finest example that I can recall, at least in my time on council,  the Lockwood development where we said no to a Lockwood on an inappropriate site on the west side, and we got a much larger and better project on the south side. And so it doesn't hurt to say no to a bad idea."}], "public_hearings_3": [{"start": 6843.576, "speaker": "SPEAKER_41", "text": "All right, one more time. I actually served on the Brownfield Board of Review when I was on council. And it's a pretty interesting thing. And it's at least as interesting as the insurance board, which I heard you're going to get rid of tonight. I don't know who's going to oversee that fund. I'm a little concerned about that. And because I also hear considering getting rid of Brownfield Board of Review. So I encourage you to read the Brownfield report and the conditions that have not yet been met for this to be approved, because there's several.  should not say yes to this until those conditions are in writing. As another caller and as the report points out, it's not really a cleanup. It's basically some advanced radon systems are going in these houses, some special foundations and some trenches and things like that. $31 million. So the polluter, multiple polluters, including the University of Michigan, who use this for landfill for decades, skate, and we pay for the supposed cleanup,  by foregoing tax revenue. And that's not right. The state gives us the authority to do this, but it doesn't require us to do this. It doesn't require us to subsidize any of this. And from an investment perspective of the city, it's a terrible idea to take, I know this is how it's supposed to function, but it's a terrible idea to give the developer a dodge for the first period of that tax payment when we should have that money in our bank earning interest  for the eventual support of this infrastructure that they're putting in. But that's the way that's going to go down. So it doesn't have MEDC support it needs. It doesn't have the tips capture agreement and start date in place. And it doesn't have the duration of that written in the agreement. Those are non-starters. This should not be approved. Now, I think that  We need to set aside, the council needs to set aside personal interest for the public interest on this matter. It's a big chunk of change we're giving out. I know that a lot of development happens in this community simply because council wanted property tax to play with. And that's fine, at some point this will be developed and it will be developed properly in a way that supports the sustainable commitment that we have made to this planet, supposedly. This isn't it.  And this so-called cleanup could come back and bite us in the future when everybody's sucking methane out of their basements, just like they're sucking dioxin. We should not be paying for polluter cleanups. Ann Arbor is a gem in this city, in this state. I think everybody knows that, and in this country. And we let it just turn to garbage.  We've been well below what we should be requiring our developers to get this kind of money And it's happened at lower town. It's gonna happen here. I hope it doesn't happen here. Don't let it happen here Reject this plan."}, {"start": 7165.135, "speaker": "SPEAKER_34", "text": "Evening, I'm Brett Stuntz. I'm with SME. As Mr. Lockford mentioned, we're the environmental consultant on the plan. A couple of technical pieces associated with the brownfield plan. This site was dumped on in the 40s and 50s, and then the portion where the redevelopment is being built was used as a construction borough pit and is filled with unsuitable soil. Soils that you can build on up to 30 feet down into the ground.  And the Brownfield Statute in Michigan is really an economic development statute with an environmental focus. This site has had economic development challenges that have prevented its redevelopment. The environmental challenges are interwoven with the soils challenges, the geotechnical challenges, all of the things that the Brownfield Statute across the state has been an effective tool for promoting redevelopment. And so, as part of the Brownfield process, which is typical throughout Michigan,  The focus is on due care, which means that it's redeveloped in a way that's safe for use. So people aren't exposed to unsafe environmental conditions. And we looked at what we've been assessing the site for over three years. We looked at what are the costs associated with actually cleaning the site up. That would be  something close to $100 million to get rid of all the material there. It's simply not realistic, but what is proven out at other sites throughout the state and throughout the country  are redevelopments using engineering controls to provide a safe environment for reuse. And so there is no way, other than specialized foundations, there is no way other than venting systems, vapor mitigation systems, and those will allow the site to be reused in a safe way.  and have areas accessible to the public in a safe way, and in ways that control the issues, primarily methane, associated with the dumping that was done in the past."}], "public_comments_3": [{"start": 9670.51, "speaker": "SPEAKER_12", "text": "Yes, thank you, Mayor. I just wanted to speak a little bit about the homelessness here in Washtenaw County. The homeless crisis disproportionately affects people of color in Washtenaw County. There's approximately 60% of those experiencing homelessness that identify as black or African-American versus only 12% of black or African-American individuals that are in the county here of Washtenaw.  An eviction can appear on a renter's credit history for up to seven years, hindering their search for safe, affordable housing due to a ripple effect of negative consequences. But beyond displacement, the impact of an eviction can also cut a renter off from access to quality public transportation, getting them to school and work. The stress of the process and the upheaval of an abrupt move can also affect a tenant's mental health.  Where here in Washtenaw County, individuals experiencing homelessness with a mental illness have gone from approximately 50% to now over 80%. And with substance abuse skyrocketing somewhere near over 300%.  Studies have shown that evictions play an important role in the lives of low-income renter households and may also contribute to poverty through cascading disruptive effects such as job losses, adverse health effects, and negative consequences for children. In addition, if you become homeless after an eviction, you're also more likely to have encounters with law enforcement,  And once released Individuals are more likely to end up in a perpetual cycle of homelessness and law law enforcement encounters So I just want to say thank you to staff for putting this together working really quickly on this and Very very happy that this is happening."}], "public_comments_4": [{"start": 11106.884, "speaker": "SPEAKER_24", "text": "Good evening, Mayor and Council. Yes, as indicated, I think Council Member Dish did provide a good overview of the city. Just as a reminder, the City Council has adopted a brownfield policy that staff uses as a guide to consider projects and frame them and ultimately present them to you.  It is a policy so that it is at your judgment whether or not to want that. As it relates to the non-environmental costs for this particular brownfield plan, components of that are site preparation, some relating to the geotech, some of that as part of the environmental, proposed support of some stormwater measures on the site, and measure of the  Roundabout a contribution towards the roundabout improvements in the future at Pontiac and DuVarn The bulk of the plan is environmental but non-environmental Activities are presented as presented both by the petitioner and in the document So I guess for clarification the electrification components of this project are not included as a component of the non-environmental  Not directly. They are not a eligible activity. The city is part of that. That is part of the pro forma analysis that goes into the analysis of the financial analysis of this. And ultimately, the petitioner's ask, I'm sure, is built into that. But in short, part of the offset of that cost is the city's support, potential support of other activities on the site.  such as the roundabout, such as stormwater measures and other activities."}, {"start": 11233.642, "speaker": "SPEAKER_24", "text": "No, the city is still limited by Act 381 and the types of eligible activities that it could be used for.

Even though they are vacant, there are some value assessed to it. So while I think your characterization is not accurate in that it's going from zero to taxable, but it is accurate in that it's a significant tax increase. That increase in taxes at peak complete development is probably in the range of about $60,000.  $3 million in new tax revenue from the current level, which is about $700,000. That's taxable value."}, {"start": 11358.595, "speaker": "SPEAKER_24", "text": "This is a very challenging site  all the reasons that have been articulated. Not only does the site face challenges from the environmental perspective of its former use, both environmental related and just geotechnical, that is soil stability. It's a very challenging site to develop on. I agree that is why the site has remained vacant for some time. So in short, I think that  I think it is unlikely, likely impossible that the site would not be developed with some sort of brownfield assistance."}]}
