Myself and many members of our association have attended all the community meetings regarding the Earhart Road 2023 project since 2019. I have spoken and written to you about this project now for over a year. We have wanted to see production and resurfacing for many years.  Our goal was to eliminate the sidewalk gap project because it would not serve its desired purpose and still won't because significant gaps remain in front of Boxford Cemetery and between the Pine Tree Street with no plans to fill those gaps. Also, because it would infringe upon and significantly harm our property and likely seriously damage our mature trees and paintings and plantings.  We were very disappointed that it took numerous attempts to be heard by the city. We attended meetings, we made public comments, we wrote letters, but there was no response from our representative government. Our own Ward 2 council members were told not to speak with us. It was not until we hired an attorney to force a response and provide a signed petition  that we finally received some response. We should not have had to pay thousands of dollars to force a representative government to respond and to work with us. Ultimately, Nick Hutchinson and Nick Bailey did meet and collaborate with us. They listened to our concerns especially and seriously. They investigated our suggestions to move the project west or closer to the median, which may waste the sidewalk to be closer to the existing growth.  They changed the retaining wall design and configuration to limit the damage to our property, and agreed to replace, like for like, evergreen for evergreen, for any tree that needed to be removed to accommodate their design. We do still have concerns about potential traffic issues during the construction phase.  But we would like this evening to thank Nick Bailey and Nick Hutchinson for their collaboration, and we look forward to our continuing project partnership during the construction and reforestation phase of the project.

I am going to have to consult with members of the administration about the issues of the use of asphalt in resurfacing streets in Ann Arbor and about  the circulation study that is proposed for the downtown area of Ann Arbor. But I want you to know that I agree with Alan Haber that the downtown library lot should be a public park. The downtown has no child-friendly open space. Children,  are not a political constituency. They can't vote. There's no quid pro quo there. You all took the label Democrat when you ran for office.  When the mayor and a majority of the council solicit high-rise builders and slavishly rezone properties to serve them, that's 20th century Republican behavior.

This city council has stood so fiercely against any Palestinian human rights resolution for so many years.  Think about it. Think about it. A lot of these people look very much like Palestinians. If they're going to treat Palestinians that way, how do you think they're going to treat you? How do you think they're going to treat you?  If they think Palestinians are so disposable, we've been in here 21 straight years, demanding a simple human rights resolution against the apartheid state of Israel, and this city council has thrown every obstacle in our way. Radina here, when he had the gavel in his fist, practically banged her out of the room. Ayer has taken campaign money from old friends of the Israel Defense Forces,  Just this week, you saw the Israel Defense Forces shooting helicopter gunships into an over-packed refugee camp of Palestinians. This is the kind of racist bastard of a city council that we're faced with. Again, if they think Palestinians are so disposable, so murderable,  What do you think they think about you? What do you think they think about you? Unfortunately, whenever we bring up Palestinian human rights, the city council gets up on their chair and screams about the Holocaust in Europe, which happened. It ended in 1945.  And this council uses the Holocaust as a weapon against the Palestinian people to help Israel kill more Palestinians. Whenever we mention Palestinian human rights, they jump up on their chair and scream anti-Semitism as a weapon against the Palestinian people.  Even Watson and Song were practically crying like a baby over the sufferings of the Holocaust. Well, God damn it, it ended almost 80 years ago. Think about what you're doing now.

These are things the community has to have. It's not 10% black admissions at the University of Michigan. It's one thing. And I hope the community feels confident enough to come in here and get another victory demanding reparations on a big enough scale  to make up for what's been stolen from the community, which is actually $97 trillion, according to a book by Jason Hickel called The Divide.  I hope the community will build on this thing that's being passed tonight and demand a drastic expansion of the Neutral Zones program called Future Corps, which doesn't just prepare students for college, it gets students into college, pays for their college, and furthermore, it gets them actually into jobs, not just job training.  And this program, Future Corps, should be drastically expanded. And that's not all. This city council has a lot of relationships with the University of Michigan. This city council can force the University of Michigan to keep its promise of 10% black admissions.  These are all things the community can demand. And don't be frightened by the Supreme Court ruling. There's still a window in that ruling. There's a window in that ruling that says your experiences dealing with racism, confronting racism, overcoming racism, those experiences can be taken into account for college admissions. They can be taken into account for college admissions. So you have the power. You have the power.  You have the power to push the city council for real reparations, massive reparations. You have the power to push the city council for a massive expansion of the future core program under city supervision to get every child all the way through college, all the way through college and into a good job.  You have the power to push the city council to force University of Michigan to keep its promise of 10% black admissions. There is quite a lot you have the power to do.

I wanted to share from a perspective of someone who has dealt with your police officers. The Black Lives Matter mural, as you know, was desecrated. And I called the police. Why? Because it was a crime, right? Felony, actually. And I had one of my Caucasian sisters there with me.  And I was visibly upset because for me, it's more than just yellow paint on the ground. It's more than just words on the ground. They're expressions that we all need to be reminded of the value in black lives. Your officer, noticing me visibly upset, walked right past me to my Caucasian sister. And she said to him,  I didn't call you. Well, no, that's not true, because she did call after I called. But she said, this is the individual that reached out to you all first. And he came back and he had the most arrogant, nasty attitude of someone that is dealing with the public and someone that is upset, right? It was very disturbing to me.  At that point, it was more than just the mural being desecrated. Now it's the way that your police officers are handling black folks, showing that they do have bias. So when you vote on this today, I want you to understand that this is not a problem that's over there. The problem of bias rests right here in the city of Ann Arbor with your officers. And to take it a step further, I asked to speak to a supervisor who never showed up.  I asked to have the chief call me, never called. And you don't have a problem with bias here? No, we do. And so while, yes, we are grateful and we got some thumbs up of people that are going to pass this tonight, there's always more work to do. And this is not to come in and say that what you did was bad, but it's always got to lean more into the work. And understand, lastly, that unless this has more meat  As far as enforcement is concerned, we're going to be dealing with what the county is dealing with right now. Because in the county, on day one, our prosecutor passed, no pretext stops. But guess what? They're still happening.  They are still happening and their officers are not being reprimanded for making these stops. I am asking that you all make an amendment tonight to put in that these officers must follow this ordinance. This isn't a resolution. This isn't a suggestion. This is an ordinance that needs just a little more meat so that we can hold these officers accountable if they continue to do pretext stops. Thank you.

So I am a... Let me bring attention to my shirt. This is a 2014 Black Student Union shirt from here at the University of Michigan. This is who...  This is the ethos of U of M and Ann Arbor, to a certain extent, for who we really are. If y'all can't see, it's a Black Power shirt with the Muhammad Ali quote in the back. This is who we really are. On the topic of these pretext stops and how they affect poor black people, like myself, they can have devastating  devastating consequences to people's livelihoods moving here. I'm sorry, people's livelihoods moving forward with their lives long after the interactions have occurred. Pretext stops often lead to contraband charges and all types of resisting arrest and fleeing and alluding and all types of other issues that had nothing to do with keeping the public safe fundamentally.  As things stand now, I have my own issues with the, I don't want to incriminate myself, but I have my own issues with the prosecutor's office as things stand right now stemming from this very issue. I have to say this publicly that it has been the mostly Democratic elected leaders in the prosecutor's office and in the sheriff's office that have offered the most resistance  to this kind of narrative. If you ask them, this stuff just isn't happening, right? They solved racism in 2020, upon the election of Ellie Savin and Company, and this type of narrative is very frustrating, especially from young black men who don't see very much representation in these kinds of spaces.

So everybody in the room listen. White folks, pay close attention. This is a conversation that I had with somebody recently. So I'm speaking from a point of privilege.  As white folks, we have the ability to kind of look at these things and do incremental change because we're kind of in the cat bird seat. Incremental change kind of serves us in some ways and it makes us feel good about what we're doing. You have to understand what's not even being fully expressed from the crowd because some people don't want to get up in here because they're going to lay into you because there are generations  of pain behind this. The time for incremental changes have passed. And so when we have these opportunities, when we have ARPA funds, when we have excise money, when we have things like this, we cannot do business as usual. We cannot do status quo. We cannot do something that is incremental because these things swing back. What happens two years when money gets tight again? Where are these things gonna come from?  We're going to be right back in the same situation. So everybody's telling you out here they're holding you accountable. And what they're holding you accountable is they want you to do something grand. They want you to not be afraid to fall on your freaking face. This is not a political issue. This is a matter of people's lives. And pseudo-liberalism that often takes place in Ann Arbor is worse.  than people who outright tell you they don't care about your issues. So you're hearing a lot of upset, you're hearing a lot of angst. I'm using my privilege at this point in time to tell you the day of the middle-aged white male was long and it was fruitful. The reason why I didn't want to come up here right away is because it isn't my time to speak.  Other people's voice need to be heard. And you're right, 400,000 is a start. It is a small start. It's a drop in the bucket. I don't know if 97 trillion is the number, but I know 400,000 isn't. So, I ask you to consider these things because people do pay attention to what happens in Ann Arbor. Maybe more than they should.  But the fact is, you can set precedent for other people. You can show people what is possible. You can be genuinely progressive and make a difference.

I live in Ward 5 in the city. And while I'm here in my role as a community member, I'm also a faculty member at the School of Public Health at the University of Michigan. And I focus my research and teaching on approaches to public safety. I'm here in support of the Driving Equality Ordinance. And the testimony that's already been shared by residents is critically important. And I just want to add another perspective as well.  The proposed ordinance is in line with a policy statement by the American Public Health Association. The American Public Health Association is a 150-year-old body that represents a broad base of public health professionals. I and many of my colleagues at the School of Public Health are members of this association.  And in their policy statement, the organization urges municipal governments to, quote, advance equity and justice by decriminalizing and eliminating officer enforcement of regulations such as minor traffic violations, including expired registration and broken taillights.  among many other things that the policy statement says. I invite you to find the policy statement here at this QR code, as well as other city policies that the city can adopt to really address this issue. The American Public Health Association has made this policy recommendation based on years and years of rigorous research showing the harms of everyday policing, including traffic stops, the harms that can have on residents, especially marginalized residents.  This ordinance will also complement the unarmed response program that the city will soon be funding. Ultimately, in a safe and equitable community, the research shows that interactions between residents and police should be minimized and access to supportive services should be expanded. The driving equality ordinance will help reduce the possible pathways to jail or prison and the unarmed response program will help increase supportive services for those in need.  The synergy of these two initiatives will lead to not just better public safety, but a community where there are better opportunities for all members to thrive. In public health, we try to prevent things before they're happening, and this driving a quality ordinance.  will help prevent discrimination, prevent the potential for police violence, and also prevent pathways to jails and prisons. I urge you to align our city with this research on the issue and pass the ordinance as a starting point to address these issues.

You can also take one look at me and know that I am not someone who is personally affected by the matter at issue today. But I wanted to come forward in my capacity as an engineer, as someone who has received training in mathematics and particularly statistics to speak on this issue.  We know that racism, and in particular pretextual racism in terms of both traffic stops and stops while black people are simply walking, while are simply shopping, while are simply going about their daily lives, are mathematically demonstrable. This is something which is proven.  I think that, as many people have said before me, this is an excellent first step, but we also need to take a statistical and sane and racially equitable approach to examining other issues that involve escalation from a minor infraction, which, as we have discussed previously, may not even warrant criminal punishment whatsoever.  and escalate that into a much larger issue. As I said, these are issues that are not only affecting members of the community, especially people of colour, while they are driving. It affects them while they are going about their daily business. And I think we need to examine this issue in the broader context of the protections to the community that are brought by enforcing these principles versus the damage to the community, including escalation to use of force and potentially even death, in a broader context than just that which relates to motor vehicles.

I served in law enforcement for 10 years, so speaking on that perspective, I agree with a lot of comments that my colleagues have made. Thank you, Cynthia Harrison, and really all of city council for the work that you've done on this. Traffic stops are dangerous. We made a decision in this country long ago to use the police for literally almost everything under the sun when it comes to safety.  Traffic stops, when you're on the roadway as an officer, you can get hit. All kinds of things can happen. And then you're causing trauma for the people when you pull them over. No one likes getting pulled over. I think the majority of people in this room, when they get pulled over, their anxiety is going to go up. They're going to feel uncomfortable. And then for people that are in the black and brown community, there's a heightened fear that you might not live on that traffic stop.  When I was an officer, it was very hard for me to understand that when I first started, when I was talking to my friends. Because I thought, well, I'm just pulling you over for speeding, or I'm just pulling you over to remind you that you have a headlight out. And it took a long time in this career to really understand for my friends that we need to be more aware of the presence that we bring to people.  When we walk into rooms, when we are sitting at the park in the patrol car, when we pull people over, we can cause stress and anxiety. And there's traffic stops that I've done and I've seen how scared people were on those stops.  And so when there's situations where we can avoid those stops, we should do it. And shout out to Pullover Prevention. They've been doing a lot of work with fixing cars so people don't have to risk being stopped for these really low-level offenses.  If we started traffic stop policies right now, I don't think we would have the police stopping people for these extremely minor infractions. And so this ordinance is a step in the right direction. And we really have to do more to restructure traffic enforcement because we know that traffic stops kill people, they injure people.  And at the end of the day, safety needs to be the primary concern, not using the police in a way that they really have other things that they could be doing that would be a lot more beneficial than pulling people over for things like a crack in the windshield or loud exhaust or poverty-related things when you're driving a car.

Maybe we should think about different kinds of training, different kinds of recruitment, different kinds of technologies. I don't know. Those could maybe be down the line.

Vera works to end mass incarceration, protect immigrants' rights, and build safe, thriving communities. Vera is leading a cohort of 10 cities and counties from across the country who are interested in improving traffic safety and reducing racial disparities in traffic enforcement. Councilmember Harrison is part of this learning community.  Backed by the evidence, cities from Philadelphia to Memphis, states from Virginia to Oregon have enacted policies that remove police from enforcement of non-safety-related stops. By various counts, at least 12 jurisdictions nationwide have passed such policies, while at least 10 have done so by police order and four by prosecutorial policy. Extensive research shows that these policies provide four key benefits.  First, research shows that policies like the Driving Equality Ordinance improve traffic safety by focusing police stops on unsafe driving behavior. Second, ending non-safety-related stops can promote public safety and community trust, as the frequency of these stops compounds distrust in government institutions such as police departments and prosecutor's offices, which depend on the public's cooperation to solve crime.  Third, these policies bear more drivers of the physical, psychological, and economic harms caused by traffic stops. And fourth, these policies reduce harmful racial disparities. As we have heard tonight about the recent report in Ann Arbor, that found significant racial disparities across the board, but particularly for equipment violations. And the findings in Ann Arbor are consistent with research nationwide  finding greater disparities in non-safety-related stops than in safety-related stops. Eliminating these stops worked. After Philadelphia instituted its policy on low-level stops, traffic stops involving Black men went down 54%. Now, opponents of these policies tend to argue that they're necessary for fighting crime and keeping the roads safe, both of which are unsupported by evidence. Regarding public safety, these stops rarely result in the recovery of guns or other contraband.  A national study found that the police recovered guns in fewer than 1% of non-safety-related stops, while another study found that the eight largest California police departments recovered guns in just 0.5% of all traffic stops. And regarding road safety, banning low-level stops does not prohibit police from making traffic stops due to more serious equipment violations, like two missing headlights or anything causing visibly reckless driving.  A Connecticut analysis found that the equipment violations in forced and low-level stops do not contribute to accidents. Finally, polling shows that policies like the Driving Quality Orders have strong bipartisan vote support. Voters clearly understand that there are better ways to handle these issues, as do members of Ann Arbor who are considering this initiative. So I urge you to vote for them. Thank you."}, {"start": 5556, "speaker": "SPEAKER_29", "text": "Hi, yes. Good evening, Mayor and City Council. My name is Summer Berman, and I've lived and worked in and around Ann Arbor for most of the last 30 years, and I am calling to encourage you to vote yes on the Driving Equality Ordinance. I will be brief because you've heard from lots of folks already, and I would like to second basically everyone who's spoken in support of this ordinance.  In addition to all of the insightful testimony that you've heard here tonight and all of the elements that are listed in the findings section of the proposed ordinance, I'd also like to emphasize that people with mental illness are also disproportionately represented in the criminal legal system and black people with mental illness even more so.  According to NAMI Michigan, about one in four people with a serious mental illness have been arrested by the police at some point in their lifetime. And about two in five adults in jail or prison have a history of mental illness. Jail is not the right place for these folks to end up. If we stop picking up people for non-criminal activities and stop them from entering the prison pipeline,  We not only work to reduce the racial inequity in our community, as you've heard all throughout the evening, but we can also work towards getting people with mental health conditions the medical and social services they need rather than continuing to fill our jail. I hope that you will support this ordinance and thank you for your time."}], "public_hearings_4": [{"start": 5864, "speaker": "SPEAKER_08", "text": "I think that the solid waste thing is, you need to fix that. But I wanted to just tell you really quickly, because I forgot to say this, that  What you all are repairing here is years of atrocities against the black community. When you think about the history of policing, in the history of policing, they were slave catchers. And they're still out trying to catch slaves, some of them with that mentality. So what we're doing here, and I'm asking you all, please make this amendment. Make this more than pomp and circumstance. Make it more than just performative. If you do not make it,  This amendment these officers are not going to obey this ordinance. Thank you. Thank you."}]}
