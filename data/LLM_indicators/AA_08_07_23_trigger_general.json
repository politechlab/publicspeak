But as you know, of all the city commissions, we are the only commission with the word community in our name. And so we're inviting the community out. We hope to have members of council, members of the police department and others to come out. That forum is going to be September 27th. Now, our normal meeting is on the last Tuesday of the month.  But because of where we wanted to have this meeting in the community, we're moving it from the Tuesday to the last Wednesday, which will be the 27th of September, Wednesday the 27th.

C1AR zoning seems entirely appropriate for this area. It's right across the street from the athletic campus, near a bunch of other student housing and stuff. And the plan here will provide much needed housing while being way less carbon intensive than most of our other structures in the city. The site plan also provides a free public plaza that's about the size of the library lane surface parking lot, and it provides it at no expense to the city.  So please support C1. Also, while I can't speak to the details of C3, I'm generally supportive of regulations that allow people to make informed decisions. I happen to luck out by purchasing a relatively well-insulated house that isn't incredibly expensive and wasteful to heat and cool, but much of our housing stock is older and poorly insulated. A purchaser may not know they're in for thousands of dollars of insulation work or thousands of dollars of extra energy bills.  It seems perfectly reasonable to require disclosures around energy consumption during a real estate transaction so that new home buyers know what to expect and also to encourage sellers to make energy efficiency improvements prior to sale.

Lower Burns Park, close to Stadium Boulevard, the  the east part of Stadium Boulevard, but that's a handy commute to the west part of Stadium Boulevard, which is part of the proposed TC zoning, TC1 zoning. And I want to speak to TC1 in opposition to two of the changes that have been proposed to making it easier for car dealerships and car rental agencies to set up shop.  Car dealerships and car rental agencies are densely car-centered businesses. They're businesses that exist because of the car, in order to get you to drive a car, and are completely car-brained. A typical additional new car on the road will rack up thousands, if not tens of thousands of miles. Having any kind of  improvement to the ability for businesses in the city to sell and rent cars is at odds with our stated goals. It's at odds with our goals to reduce vehicle miles traveled because what can you do with the car? You can travel some vehicle miles.  It's at odds with our complete streets because these businesses are very car-dense uses. And it's at odds with pedestrian bicycle safety because the sorts of roads that you get when you have lots of car dealerships are roads effectively known as stroads or street roads.  And some people have wittily referred to them as car sewers because they're wide and they're deep and they're nearly impossible to cross on foot or on bicycle. They're dangerous. And things that we can do to reduce the vehicle intensity of our city are all good. So I'm opposed to the proposed changes to TC1 that would  Allow car dealerships and car rental agencies as Even except even special exception uses. I don't see any particular reason.

But what I want to say is that  there's a complete lack of any feedback or focus on operations within the pedestrian safety area. And as a council member, I was frequently accused of being negative to staff or negative to my council members. I've given this a lot of thought. The problem is that we have a local political machine  that is focused on more shiny new things. Staff realizes that they will be roadkill if they don't go along with this amorphous political machine in our community.  That said, the city is liable, so the political machine can go over there and do whatever they want, but the city is liable if we have dangerous situations in our community that are not being addressed by the city. Situations that have been identified in writing time after time, and one includes a letter where the city committed to taking actions back in 1998  to keep the vegetation cleared from the right away in the King School neighborhood. That is not being done. It is extremely dangerous and now we will have many vehicles cutting through there because they cannot go southbound on Earhart and they will be using these neighborhood roads to drop their kids off, especially at Saint Paul School.

We represent 1,100 real estate professionals in the Ann Arbor area. On behalf of our membership, I'm here today to speak in opposition to the Home Energy Rating Disclosure Ordinance.  Although we applaud the city's efforts, this ordinance does little to help the city to achieve the 8 to 0 goals. It targets a small group of owners selling their homes, which is given by the owner to the buyer, who typically does not have the financial resources to act on the recommendations that are presented through the ordinance.  We have worked openly with the city staff and the Energy Commission to thoroughly understand the proposed ordinance and are aware of the city's plans to hire one home energy assessor, even though the ordinance does not include the cost of the assessment for the city to bear this expense.  Keeping in mind that the city staff has also pointed out that they have met with additional firms to help with assessments. Staff is clearly aware that one assessor will not be able to meet the demands in a timely fashion, potentially stalling home sales and or adding additional cost to the transaction.  If you would please, consider our rental housing inspection process as a framework for energy assessment. With as many as five inspectors on staff, it can take several weeks and sometimes several months to have a rental property inspected. Most importantly, and as pointed out in our August 3rd letter to city council, sellers will not be able to meet the advertisement requirements of the ordinance.  Additionally, it's clear from the 30-month report to the Portland City Council that most buyers are not in a financial position to make this kind of improvement needed to increase their score significantly. If by chance they are, realtors locally point out that buyers will prioritize the need to improve their home, such as making updates to kitchens or baths over adding installation to their homes.  Either way, after making one of the largest investments of their lifetime, the facts from the Portland study show that new buyers simply do not choose to make energy-based improvements to their homes. Lastly, let's keep in mind that this is a very basic checklist. It's not a blow-door test. It estimates the cost to heat, cool, and light the property. Rather than an estimate, please remember that buyers can contact DTE and obtain an actual cost for recent years.  Honorable council members, we respectfully ask that you empower city staff to design an incentive based energy assessment program, a model that others will follow a program that will empower all Ann Arbor homeowners to actively participate in achieving the 8 to 0 goals rather than a forced program for sellers who will only face punishment after leaving our great city.

I'm here to encourage you to vote yes in support of Carytown Concert House's club liquor license application with the city of Ann Arbor.  Carytown Concert House is proud to be entering its 39th year as a non-profit arts venue, a cultural gem in our community that offers a unique opportunity to enjoy exceptional artists in an intimate historical setting that is unlike any other concert experience in Ann Arbor.  This coming 23-24 season, we have plans to present 90 concerts with a culturally diverse and eclectic combination of local, national, and international world-class artists. As the Artistic and Executive Director, I believe this club license is instrumental to the future growth of the organization and would greatly enhance our ability to serve the community and attract folks to the Carytown Farmers Market in Carytown area.  For the past few decades, KCH has routinely applied for and used all 12 allowable special license from the state each year for special events. KCH founders, a club of supporters who give $300 or more annually, have expressed a desire to have more than 12 opportunities to enjoy wine or beer at KCH in a given year.  After decades of going through the arduous process of obtaining the special license, the KCH Board of Trustees now supports a club liquor license for the organization, as it would allow us to more easily build community among its founders club by routinely offering concert afterglows and other events especially for them, such as artists meet and greets, including wine and beer.  It will also help us generate additional revenue for KCH through increased concession sales. And it would allow us to thoughtfully target concerts and special events that would lend themselves well to the inclusion of alcohol concessions, such as concerts held on New Year's Eve or Valentine's Day, our Dance Hall Night Series, our Wine Women and Song Concert Series, or concerts that occur in conjunction with other area events, such as Kindle Fest or Ann Arbor Pride.  It would also offer us the opportunity to give a similar scenario as happens at other iconic venues here in Ann Arbor, such as the Arc and the Michigan Theater. On behalf of the KCH staff and board of trustees, I want to thank you for your favorable consideration of our application and assure you that we will use the license with appropriate care and responsibility.

I'd like to speak to you on three topics tonight. First, CA10, the purchase of a new wood chipper, combined with CA11, the rental of street sweepers.  While I'm in favor of both of these and don't believe they should be at all controversial, the fact that as a city we're willing to purchase or rent new fossil fuel powered devices for these purposes that have spent years delaying the purchase of similar equipment size for bike lanes shows a sort of double think with respect to our environmental goals.  For bike lanes, we're reducing the effectiveness of these energy-saving, emissions-reducing bike lanes by demanding a very high bar for the maintenance equipment that we buy, a bar that we simply are not applying to other purchases by the city. If studied, I would reasonably expect  that purchasing even a diesel-powered street sweeper for the bike lanes that would allow us to make them properly separated and protected would have net negative emissions due to the car trips that would be turned into bike trips. The same cannot be said for either of the items on these orders tonight. If we truly want to meet our 80-0 goals,  we should be willing to do the potentially unpalatable but still very effective things to help achieve these goals, especially if we're willing and able to do those same unpalatable things for goals unrelated to H2O. Second, I'd like to speak on the TC1 amendment, C2. I'm  deeply concerned about the addition of automobile-related uses, even with a special exception as primary uses. There's no indication that these exceptions will be within the spirit of TC1, and the addition of automobile-related uses as a valid primary use runs a strong risk of entirely defeating the purpose of the TC1 district.  Please reconsider this. Finally, I'd like to request that the city make a bike lane gap dashboard similar to the very useful sidewalk gap dashboard we have. This dashboard should not simply be bike lane or no bike lane, but rather include a level of service. 30 seconds. And abilities. No bike lane is obviously a gap, but painted bicycle gutters or even buffered bike lanes that have a whole  Two strips of paint a car would have to cross to kill a bicyclist are woefully insufficient.

And I'm calling with regards to C1, which is a rezoning with conditions for the block bounded by State, Stimson, Henry, and White Streets, commonly known as South Town. The conditional zoning request should be denied for the following reasons. It is the kind of conditional zoning that the courts have  very clearly ruled against. And it would create significant possible repercussions to property owners and tenants from many blocks nearby in the area commonly known as Lower Burns Park. And there is a legal remedy. The same exact site plan could be approved in a different manner that would be legal. The way it's applied for is not, I suggest you speak with your city attorney about that for a more formal opinion, but this is very similar  So what happened with the Garnet, which was voted down because the conditional zoning there was not legal, but it was later approved with the exact same plan with the PUD. So let me focus on some of the ramifications of doing it this way. Right now, the city has decided that short-term rentals that are not owner-occupied should not be allowed, not permitted.  in areas that are residentially zoned. That would include dislocation, but it would also include everything along State Street between State and White as you go up north from here, Stadium, Granger, McKinley, Dewey was in there, all the way up to Arch where north of Arch it's already zoned for something that would permit short-term rentals. So you take all these areas that are not intended for short-term rentals per our law,  And if you approve this one with the condition, in this case, they're going to allow short-term rentals, but they're going to cap it to a certain amount. Conditional zoning for the next person that applies in one of these places up and down State Street, across from University of Michigan's athletic facilities, you can't say no to the next person because conditional zoning has to be voluntary by the developer. And you can't turn them down for not volunteering what the last one did.  30 seconds. You're backing into a situation where you're going to be forced to approve potentially downtown height buildings or a conversion of those houses, as is, into short-term rental situations, removing from our long-term rental stock in an area that, right now, it's mostly student rental, but there's also a lot of families that live there. So whether you're an owner-occupant or a tenant, we risk  losing long-term housing stock in favor of short-term housing by accident. If we did this deliberately as part of the comprehensive plan revisions, so be it. I'm not backing into it.

I moved to Ann Arbor about a year ago from Evanston.  where my partner was a graduate student at Northwestern. It's a very similar kind of college town. And there, we rented a one-bedroom apartment about 550 square feet for $1,200 a month. We anticipated moving here that we'd be able to find similar rentals because the cost of living comparisons suggest that Ann Arbor is only 1.5% to 2% more expensive than Evanston. We were shocked then to discover  that a comparable apartment here is $1,600 a month, which is 33% more expensive than what we were paying. It is particularly egregious because salaries here are about the same as they are in Evanston. So this represents a large percentage of our income. I rent from McKinley Properties at Traver Crossing now, which we have found to be less than desirable. We've had issues with mold.  a hot water heater that is constantly in and out of service, as well as struggling to get any kind of maintenance for things as simple as a light switch repair. Public spaces, for example, the laundry room is consistently covered in mold, has standing water, and roof ceiling tiles that disintegrate and are not repaired despite repeated requests for maintenance.  We've had five property managers since I've been here, which is only a year. So there's been no continuity in management for tenants. And just a very small example of the lack of respect for tenants, the washing machines changed from being coin-operated to being app-operated recently. The app itself is buggy, and in its privacy policy, it says that  Not only does it collect all of your data, your demographics, your location, your employment, your name, your birthday, your email, your phone number, it can and will sell it to third parties and other vendors that they can use in their marketing materials. And I don't know about you, but I don't really like it when my washing machine is selling my data. So I tried to use a wash card where you pre-fill it. But the pre-filling card station is located in the property management office.  which has been closed all summer because our property manager is managing four other properties and has been unable to be on the property at all.

I'm here as a renter, a member of the Graduate Employee Organization Housing Caucus, and a member of the McKinley Tenants Association. My five years as a renter at Travers Crossing, a McKinley property in Ward 1, have been defined by the mismanagement of my rental property, including management authorizing entry into my apartment for repair without my permission or notification, urgent maintenance tickets for things like backup kitchen sinks getting left unassigned by management for days at a time.  an exterior building door that was jammed shut for two days during the winter, such that the only exit to my building was an iced-over door not maintained for winter use, and the same exterior door being left unlocked without a handle for weeks, even as I received notifications from the property to beware of package theft and multiple emails from the management office left unanswered.  It's logical to ask why I haven't moved to a different property. But last year, after management increased my rent by $125 per month, and then, as I was deciding whether or not to remove my lease, retracted this offer and raised my rent an additional $50 per month, I tried to find a new apartment. I soon learned that McKinley Properties owns 60% of the workforce housing in Washtenaw County, making it nearly impossible to leave a McKinley property.  When I did find some alternatives, each property had a waitlist for new tenants and a waitlist fee, usually around $350. Even though these fees are refundable, a spot on a waitlist did not guarantee a unit, and I would need to make multiple deposits or run the risk of not getting an apartment. I could not afford to pay hundreds of dollars in waitlist fees, essentially interest-free loans to landlords, but also could not risk finding myself without an apartment. So I was forced to stay in my McKinney apartment.  Again, this spring, when it came time for my renewal, the new lease came along with a $220 per month increase and an increase to late fees and pet fees. Last time I spoke at a city council meeting, it was in support of the right to renew ordinance, which passed last fall. This, along with the early leasing ordinance and creation of the renter commission, marked important steps the council has taken toward giving security to tenants and holding landlords accountable. But there is much more that can and needs to be done. First, eliminating both refundable and non-refundable fees that prohibit many renters  from finding, moving from, or staying in an apartment. Second, ensuring that existing ordinances and building codes are enforced, and proactively addressing tenant issues by working with the Renters Commission to expand renter protection. And finally, endorsing the effort to repeal the statewide rent stabilization preemption and refer local government power to make laws about equitable rent.  She used the words of McKinley CEO Albert Barrett, who spoke on a Claims Detroit podcast last year. 30 seconds. 100% of Washtenaw County, if not just 60%. If city council does not take action to protect renters, the city will soon be owned by its landlord.

Sometimes it doesn't take a revisionist to enlighten us about the exaggerations we find in the Holocaust narrative. Often the enlightenment comes at the hands of the Holocaust traditionalists themselves. Recommended reading from the Anna Republic School's Holocaust curriculum is the well-known novel Night by the famous Elie Wiesel, page 32.  Not far from us, huge flames were rising from a ditch. Something was being burned there. A truck drew close and unloaded its hold. Small children, babies. Yes, I did see this with my own eyes. Children thrown into the flames. Is it any wonder that ever since then, sleep tends to elude me?  And in another book by the same author, The Jews of Silence, he writes about the alleged massacre of 33,000 Jews in Babi Yar in the Ukraine.  From page 48, we read, eyewitnesses say that for months after the killings, the ground continued to spurt geysers of blood. Without supporting evidence, Wiesel wants us to believe that blood spurted out of the ground in geyser-like fashion for months, when no one has ever seen such an occurrence. But in a third book, Legends of Our Time, Wiesel comes clean.  In the introduction, he writes about a conversation with the local rabbi. What are you writing, the rabbi asked, stories. I said he wanted to know what kind of stories, true stories. About people you knew? Yes, about people I might have known. About things that happened? Yes, about things that happened or could have happened. But they did not? No, not all of them did.  In fact, some were invented from almost the beginning to almost the end. The rabbi leaned forward as if to measure me up and said with more sorrow than anger, that means you are writing lies. I did not answer immediately. The scolded child within me had nothing to say in his defense, yet I had to justify myself. Things are not that simple, rabbi. Some events do take place but are not true.  Others are, although they never occurred. What will the reaction of Ann Arbor students be when they read of such an admission?

So you can see why my partner got anxious when we discovered a cabinet door in our current kitchen would no longer open all the way because it was scraping against a drooping ceiling.  We had to report the ceiling three times. At first, we reported just that it was drooping, then that there were cracks that had begun to spread. And finally, after almost two full months with no response, we submitted a report that let them know the ceiling now sagged several feet across. Along with those reports, I had to call at least twice.  In the end, they got a contractor to come out, ignore our instructions to contact us before entering, and get drywall all over our kitchen. They had neglected to put down a tarp or any other potential reasonable protections, so our appliances, countertop, and the floor were coated in debris. And because we weren't informed that they were coming, our cats were exposed to the dust while we were away.  And while the work was being done, we had no easy access to our kitchen to prepare food in our home. We didn't know what to do at the time or who to talk to for help as McKinley had proved unreliable. And that's just one example of sort of what we've dealt with there.  Just providing housing comes with significant responsibilities. It involves management and maintenance. It requires varying costs of insurance. And I'm sure there's so many other concerns I don't know about yet. But as tenants, we pay McKinley to cover these costs and fulfill these responsibilities. And a lot of us have no choice but to rely on them for housing. Well, they failed  They failed to fulfill their duties as a landlord and I wanted to share this story in particular to ask that the council continue to hold them accountable and continue to work towards tenant protections."}, {"start": 2413.717, "end": 2419.163, "speaker": "SPEAKER_20", "text": "Thank you.

Yes, my name is Justin Yuan, and I've been a McKinney property tenant for three years. I am calling in on the issue of non-refundable fees and tenant applications. Even as they raise their rent year after year, landlords charge fees for applying to wait lists, to applying to rental properties, and everything in between. They want to make money, not just on the people who are having to sign leases, but everyone who's even looking for housing in the area, right? Something that we all need in this age of human rights.  Even when these fees are ostensibly refundable, it's extremely difficult and nigh impossible to actually get refunded. I urge City Council to eliminate non-refundable fees and heavily restrict even refundable fees in order to remove the burden from tenants who can't bear this cause as much as a landlord who might lose out on 50 bucks. This is a necessary step in addressing the larger issue at hand of landlord greed and overreach.  The result of recent reforms, like the early leasing ordinance and right to renew, show that landlords themselves, whether they're huge corporate monstrosities like McKinley or even so-called office-top landlords, can't be trusted to obey these things on their own. They can't be trusted to follow new reforms that get passed and can't be trusted to follow standards, regulations, and guidelines that already exist.  We need to fully fund the departments, offices, and relevant mechanisms to enforce everything that we have on the board already and go further in strengthening that infrastructure and building up the capacity to fully hold landlords to account and make sure that we have housing that we can live in, that we can not just live in and keep the rain on us, but live dignified lives, where we don't have to deal with mold, respiratory issues. We don't have to deal with structural issues that put our compartments away.  where we can live like human beings. I highly urge city council to take tenants' rights seriously. In my day job, I'm a union organizer. And we all know, as many of you do on city council, that workers are on the back foot. But when I started doing this housing stuff, when I started having housing issues of my own, I found that tenants, the rights for tenants and the fight that we have makes the fight that we're waging on the worker organizing side seem like a cakewalk.  It's absolutely brutal, and we have little to no recourse on a wide, wide range of issues. No, we're all workers, whether we're in the workplace or out of the workplace. And I know many of you on this council make a big deal out of your co-worker credentials. I highly urge you to take this seriously, and realize you can't be a pro-worker while also neglecting the crisis and taking these things like they're not serious.

I think it's great that it's there.  But if you're heading west on Catherine and making a left-hand turn, heading south on 5th Ave, I've noticed some real close calls with a couple people riding down, because you're kind of coming down a hill on Catherine.

My name is Faith Redwine-Otieno, and I'm a social worker. I have worked for Washtenaw County Community Mental Health as a support coordinator before my present position as a care coordinator for Michigan Primary Care Association, where I work with 40 fairly qualified health centers, including Packard Health. I'm also a member of the Washtenaw County Social Services Board and the Fund Review Board, to name a few. Since moving to Ann Arbor in June 2016, I have lived in seven different apartment complexes, including my present home at Park Place, owned by McKinsey Properties,  and one privately owned condo as some of you condominiums. The reason for moving often has to do with the cost of housing in Ann Arbor. I have learned that housing doesn't accommodate middle class single parent households or lower income individuals. Housing in Ann Arbor is geared mainly towards higher income families and college students. In addition to this, private landlords or property management companies are not the best landlord. I have lived in private property as some of you only to have a landlord who is more interested in receiving regular monthly income instead of providing safe housing.  Upon moving out, my DTE bill had increased significantly due to faulty window treatment. My current place of residence is worse because my mailbox hasn't broken since moving in, and the washer and dryer downstairs need purchase and debit cards. I had signed a lease to pay $1,399 in rent in April 2023, only to receive a monthly billing statement showing regular rental increases. I paid $1,457.95 for May,  $1,492.30 for June and $1,497.04 for July. I believe cooperative housing is a great idea, and I did suggest this during the funding review team meeting. Cooperatives are affordable and are created to accommodate multiple income levels in addition to having tenants serving on the board to address community concerns. When concerns are raised with property management or private landlords, the issues are not addressed immediately.  In addition to this, some income-based units that are available at some apartment complex are still relatively high in cost. Plus, as thought to be wrong, some subsidized housing complexes are horrible due to negative connotations associated with the word subsidized in poor individuals. We must remember that safe, affordable, livable, and equitable housing is a human right. In fact, one of the social determinants of health includes safe housing.  When individuals are unable to afford or do not receive safe housing, it can affect their mental health, well-being, and quality of life.

I've been a renter, I've been a homeowner, and then I'm back to renting again, thanks to divorce.  I live in Traver Crossing at Barton Drive and Plymouth Road. It's owned by McKinley. The reason I'm there is strictly because of the location. The location is great. Everything else is terrible. It's right across the street from my daughter's school. She's able to walk to her dad's house and to her friend's house. So that's super important. Our two-bedroom is $1,623. With fees and utilities, it's over $1,700 a month. And our rent went up 8% this year.  I feel stuck. I don't want to move out of Ann Arbor. I don't think I should have to move out of Ann Arbor. If you're a renter, there's really no cheaper place than McKinley.  It's not a healthy place to live. We have black mold. And the main problem is the plumbing is from like the 60s. It all needs to be replaced, but that's not... McKinley's never gonna do that because it's way too expensive. So the plumbing continuously leaks and we continually have mold and bad air quality. I've had purse mice three times.  This is when you reach into your purse for something and a mouse leaps out of your purse and onto you. It's become almost like a regular. Anyways, yeah, there's a bad rodent problem. I'm generally pretty laid back. And I wouldn't be so angry if there wasn't such a disconnect between the quality of our living situation and the rent. It's just so incredibly mismatched. There is a new wave of tenant organizing in Ann Arbor, in Ipsy, and statewide.  Because the affordable housing crisis is making people desperate and it's it's totally unsustainable and there's really there is no place to go. Requiring developers to include a handful of affordable units to approve their building, it's completely insufficient. We need people on our side at the state level and the city level who are willing to flat outside with tenants against the big landlords.  This is not like a win-win situation. We need aggressive broad policies like limiting rent increases. We need public housing that's not for profit and that's mixed income because then you can get over, you know, some of the, you know, the negative, you know, stereotypes of public housing.  The landlords are going to fight any effective policy. And we need you to stand with us. That's why we mobilized to the city council meeting tonight. We're going to be mobilizing to Lansing to demand statewide policies. And we would like your support. So thank you for having us.

Now, over the course of the season, you will still be able to put out all the bags that you fill. I don't think even at 10 bags a week, you're going to  exceed the limit. If you put, you know, even if you did 10 every week from September to whenever it is, December, you wouldn't run out. You just can't put them out all at once.

I actually know that Kaku is from when I did my MSW field placement at International Families Outreach Project on North Campus Housing back in 2003. So that's 20 years ago.  And at the time, the housing struggles were, for international students, quite complicated, since spouses, because of their visa status, were not allowed to work here in the States. So the housing crisis continues two decades later. I really appreciated the comments, because I think we forget that we assume the housing crisis impacts mostly students. Clearly, it impacts families.  And for the Kakus, I think I want to remind folks that this is a family that raised two children in Ann Arbor Public Schools. Lydia is an active artist. You've seen her work. Oh, Mr. Kaku. I've been to Lydia's art exhibitions. Her work has been featured in Sweetwaters. Beloved community members that we know and see and witness struggle.

It looks like the existing playground minus the merry-go-round is fenced off while they do the upgrades, but it's supposed to be a four-week timeline. So I wanted to mention that, Ward 4 news. I also wanted to draw people's attention to the work of Dr. Fred Fang, who's an assistant professor at U of M Dearborn.  who's been doing a bike counter project on North Division near Catherine over the last year or so. I saw him Friday night at Ann Arbor's monthly bike party. This is an all ages, all abilities slow roll through Ann Arbor. I encourage you all to attend sometime. It's really a lot of fun and very accessible.  Anyway, he let me know that record numbers were coming in. He had the July numbers, and his team observed an all-time high monthly count of 10,502 bike trips. Average daily trips were 339. The peak day count was 508, which is also the all-time high. That's over 10,000 rides that were not in a car, helping us not only with our climate action goals, but also with congestion for those who are driving.  And we're seeing the number of rides, this is consistent with an increase that we're seeing in bike riding as we build out buffered, separated bike lanes. Division in particular was just recently extended all the way down to Hoover. And so I think this just highlights the importance of creating a safe, complete network for people to get where they need to go.  You can visit the dashboard. If you just Google bike counter in Ann Arbor, it will come up. His team uses a cable on the ground, much like you see for automobile traffic counts. And just as a warning, they haven't been collecting winter data because the cable is susceptible to snow plowing. So if you go there and you see no rides for the months, I think, of like November until May, it's not because there were no riders. It's because they weren't counting during that time."}, {"start": 3715.952, "end": 3716.733, "speaker": "SPEAKER_31", "text": "So that's it.

And so it's something that I certainly support. It's something that I know many of my colleagues support. Council Member Harrison and I are also working with staff right now on legislation to address the non-refundable fees and waitlist fees. We know that it's a problem. We have recommendations from the Renters Commission. And so we've actually met with legal staff and are beginning to work on an ordinance to hopefully address that.

In line with the federal emphasis on seniors aging in place, our commitment to inclusivity demands that every voice in our community is given a platform. I've discerned a gap in the ordinance which establishes the Transportation Commission. While it maintains the participation of seven public members, there is a potential oversight. There's no designated seat for someone 55 years or older.  Given that the ride provides passes for those age 60 and above, and in light of AAATA's cutback on same-day prayer transit services, efficiently hindering them from social engagements, unexpected medical visits, and contributing to car emission reductions, it's paramount to acknowledge that, akin to individuals with disabilities, seniors possess distinct transportation demands.  These include adaptive and easily accessible active mobility services, especially as the city moves forward toward more active mobility initiatives. Additionally, the City of Ann Arbor's proactive engagement in drawing seniors to settle here accentuates this oversight. Their contribution can offer invaluable insights paving the way for a public transit system that is more user-friendly for all age brackets.  Ensuring the representation can help us gain a deeper understanding of their needs and lead to improvements in our transportation framework. I propose that we revise the bylaws to reserve at least one seat for a community member who is 55 years or older. This step will ensure the incorporation of the unique perspective and requirements of our senior community in our transportation policies and services.  This is where I move to okay so with this with these considerations I move to postpone the discussion to September 18th. This interlude will grant the Transportation Commission adequate time for deliberation and feedback."}, {"start": 4624.819, "end": 4631.605, "speaker": "SPEAKER_20", "text": "Seconded by Councilmember Ackman.

So we are asked to rezone 10 lots that total 1.66 acres, which are located south of East Stadium Boulevard between South State Street and South Industrial Boulevard in the central part of the city proximate to campus.  We're asked to make the rezoning from the current zoning designation of R4C to C1AR with conditions. This will allow considerably greater density on these parcels, which are currently multi-family residential, and it will allow construction of two multi-story towers for a mixed-use building totaling 220 square feet,  that will provide approximately 215 apartments and include ground floor, retail, office, and childcare space. I would like to make it clear that the city's approval of South Town would not obligate us to approve future applications for C1AR zoning in that area, and it would not open the door for a flood of STRs in that area. Zoning is considered on a site-by-site basis. If all things were equal on a future zoning petition,  If our approval of this decision would make a compelling argument for approval in a future case, but it would not force our hand.  Even in similar geographies, the attributes of a rezoning are rarely identical from petition to petition. So, when this petition came before Planning Commission, we heard strong support, and we heard some strong support earlier tonight, because there is considerable excitement for the proposed project. It is an innovative, all-electric project with rooftop solar to reduce its carbon footprint and geothermal heating and cooling.  If all goes well, it will be the first tall mass timber construction in the state of Michigan. There are some state guidelines that I think still need to be worked through around that. This is a building structure that continuously stores carbon and will store approximately 1,740 metric tons of carbon, which, if you were wondering, is equivalent to over four  million miles driven by gas-powered cars, so that's a lot. This project does not come to us as a PUD because that would not be correct. There is an appropriate zoning category for it in our code, and that is C1AR. The developer offered four conditions.  The maximum height for these buildings will be 100 feet. C1AR has no height limit, so that's a significant restriction that is being offered. The maximum number of vehicle parking spaces for residential use on the property will be .25 per dwelling unit, which is low, and we like that, or we have expressed a liking for that.  The principal use of the property shall be multiple family residential and no more than 30% of the dwelling units may be short-term rentals. Finally, the property shall have no natural gas connections except for emergency backup power. All but the third of these, the one about 30% only for commercial use, or rather short-term rentals, all but that one were part of the site plan that the developers brought to the planning commission  so they were willing to offer these conditions and the conditions will be binding on any project that's built on this site."}, {"start": 5020.874, "end": 5024.355, "speaker": "SPEAKER_20", "text": "Thank you.

So these modifications to TC1 are a first installment on a request that Council made of Planning Commission. They permit two new uses with special exception permission or special exception use approval.  and that is automobile, motorcycle, recreation vehicle, equipment, sales, and rental, and automobile, truck, and construction equipment repair. Council had asked for particular attention to repair. It comes back to us, including sales, in recognition that auto repair is often, even typically, attached to retail.  And it comes back with retail as well as repair in the confidence that the form-based standards of TC1 make it safe to permit limited automobile-related uses. So our setbacks, other pedestrian-friendly features, and especially the limitations on surface parking.  But Planning Commission voted to make it a special exception use because it will give us an opportunity to have a good look at any site plan that comes forward for a facility such as this one. In addition, the storage and repair of automobiles, trucks, and construction equipment has to be located in an enclosed building.  Now, I understand the objections that were raised, and I think it is certainly worth deliberating them, and I know that we can start that tonight and do it again, but I want to say that without making this change, existing auto-related uses on the corridors become non-conforming, and that means that they will  kind of be frozen in amber. They will not be significantly updated until they simply become obsolete and pass out of service. This change gives existing auto-related uses conforming status, which opens the possibility that they can apply for updates that are better aligned with TC1 forms.  than their current form is. Most of the other changes are for clarity and to reduce confusion, so I'm not going to talk about those.

And just as a little bit of background for those who may not be familiar with what TC1 is, it was a relatively new zoning category that we've developed in the city that's transit corridor planning, which is  aimed at increasing the density along our major transit corridors. This is one of the pieces that we recognize that we need vastly much more housing in the city of Ann Arbor, and it is one of the tools. We need many tools, but in increasing supply, hopefully we can  at least stabilize prices in terms of cost in our community. So that was one of the pieces of really trying to reimagine some of our commercial corridors. Staten Eisenhower was the first corridor that we rezoned. Stadium-Maple area is the second, and that was done last fall. When that was done,  Stadium maples in the fifth Ward one of the things that came out and that is that that is already a very successful mixed-use commercial corridor and One of the the pieces that we heard during that and one of the reasons that council had unanimously recommended that planning Commission come back and  make a few tweaks to the ordinance was because we recognize that while we are looking to enhance have a much less car centric community in the future we recognize the needs for that. There are times that we might want to have  We essentially still want mixed-use neighborhoods. That's a goal in our A20 plan strategy for action six is to develop mixed-use neighborhoods. And so on that piece, the car rental sale, I think it makes sense that we're having it as a special exception use.  Obviously, I don't really want to see any more car dealerships there, but as we're asking folks to live car-light lifestyles, having access to car rentals in close proximity to where they live in the future would be helpful for allowing them to live car-light lifestyles. Secondarily, on the car repair piece of things,  You know, it is not necessarily, if we limit these from our neighborhoods, what we're asking is basically for them to move to the townships, and that then folks are driving their cars out to the townships and not able to walk home to their homes. So there are some additional benefits there. Also, if we're trying to build more homes for folks, maybe we shouldn't ask them to drive out of the city to get to a job.  So that was some of the rationale behind it. I did have one question for staff in terms of the changes that were made, and that was a question around the enclosure for car repairs.

My name is Zach Wasmith. I'm a manager in the Office of Sustainability and Innovations. I'm pleased to present to you the H.E.R.D. ordinance tonight or to represent it.  Briefly, the herd ordinance would, in short, require that homes in Ann Arbor acquire a home energy score prior to being listed for sale. The goals of this requirement are to enhance consumer protections by providing information about the full costs of operating a home prior to purchase and to provide a clear pathway to safer, healthier, more comfortable, and more efficient homes.  In addition to some of the responses that we've already provided to your questions, I will respond to some council questions directly asked as a part of this staff introduction.  So question one, how might this ordinance negatively impact homeowners who are lower income or don't have discretionary income, what mitigation measures are in place to ensure that further displacement of black and other ethnic minorities within the city do not occur as a result of this ordinance.  A few things to note in response to this. First, as I mentioned, one of the primary goals of the HERD ordinance is to help protect homebuyers from unexpected energy costs associated with inefficient homes. Families who face energy burden spend more than 6% of their income on energy. And in Michigan, low-income residents spend on average 15% of their income on energy bills.  These households are disproportionately low-income families with children, Black, Indigenous, or people of color, and seniors. So by requiring home sellers to disclose the energy efficiency of their homes, it can protect home buyers from purchasing a home that they would otherwise be beyond their means to heat and cool.  Secondly, the herd ordinance does not require a certain score to be achieved. This ordinance is not a performance standard, but instead it requires that a score be obtained. Even so, information gathered from the home energy score can be used to apply for city programs to help make strategic home improvements.  Third, the program will offer free home energy scores via a full-time OSI staff member and the hiring of additional capacity in the private sector as needed. This means there are no required financial costs to the home seller for getting the home energy score.  And lastly, the herd ordinance as presented tonight contains section 8606, which is a waiver program which could be used if an unexpected burden or event occurred, which prevented somebody from getting their home energy score.  Question two, when the feasibility study for this ordinance was performed, was there an investigation into the experiences of BIPOC, lower income, disabled, and older homeowners and renters in the cities where similar ordinances are already in place? If such an investigation was conducted, how did the ordinance impact the buying, selling, and renting experiences of these homeowners and renters?  Did the implementation of similar ordinances in other cities impact the availability of affordable housing stock? Can documentation be provided to support the answers to these questions?  The U.S. Department of Energy report that analyzed communities where homeowners were required to secure home energy score assessments before selling their homes found that final home prices were half a percent higher for every one-point increase in the DOE's 10-point home energy score scale.  Similarly, they found that final home sale prices were 0.4% higher for every $100 of decrease in the home energy scores estimated utility bills. The OSI staff did not find any reports that specifically investigated the impacts of the home energy scores on BIPOC, lower income, disabled, or older adults.  We did, however, meet with multiple peers in other communities to discuss how they created safety valves in their program to ensure they weren't placing an unintentional burden on especially low-income and BIPOC households. And this is how we landed on, first, the waiver program in the ordinance, second, hiring a full-time staff member to offer the assessments for free,  And third, aligning our energy rebate programs to be offered through the Community Climate Action Millage with the various categories of improvement identified in the Home Energy Score reports. So question three, how does this help Ann Arbor homeowners, landlords, and developers participate in the Attainable Housing Facilities Act, the Residential Housing Facilities Act, and or the Neighborhood Enterprise Zone  OSI staff were not involved in these programs. And given the last minute nature of this question, we were not able to coordinate with other departments to get a response. If council desires, we can follow up with colleagues in the community services and others as needed to get a response. For now, though, these are not programs that OSI administers and therefore we're unable to provide detail about the city's involvement.  Question four. How exactly is this different from DTE's Energy Audit Program? Can a chart that includes what's included in each audit and the certification process to become an auditor be provided? Are there any Ann Arbor or Washtenaw County-based auditors or program partner organizations that train the auditors for this program? The DOE  develops the home energy score. And the home energy score requires very specific data points to be gathered during an assessment. The score is based on things like the home's envelope, which is in basic terms, the separation between the inside and the outside. It's like the foundation, the roof, the walls, the windows. It also includes HVAC systems and water heating.  Basically, the higher the score, the more efficient the home, but beyond the score the home energy score report includes specific recommendations on how to improve the score with projects that have an expected payback of 10 years or less.  The energy consultations offered by DTE are quite basic in comparison to the home energy score. While the DTE consultation may provide some simple energy efficiency products, it lacks the depth of information that can provide a homeowner insights on any major changes to the home.  And yes, there are existing auditors trained to conduct home energy score assessments in our community beyond the one being hired by the OSI. And the OSI is planning to offer free training for other energy assessors that are interested in becoming certified assessors. Question five.  Why is this program instead of helping owners become zero energy homes, why this program instead of helping owners become zero energy homes through grants and no interest or low interest loans based on income. There's also the Home Improvement Expert Program and Clean Energy to Communities Program. In  In addition to the herd ordinance, we are developing programs that will help residents make improvements in their homes and businesses. These include rebates, rebate programs that are currently being designed in the OSI. However, a homeowner or a business needs to know what improvements are needed in order to make a strategic decision about their next upgrade.  Having the home energy score provides that information and can simultaneously help OSI ensure that we are directing the limited taxpayer dollars that we have to the highest impact investments. So to put it another way, the OSI is strongly considering having residents get a home energy assessment before they can apply for rebates. In this way, we'll be able to ensure that residents are getting matched with the right incentive to make the biggest impact on their bills, their health, their safety and the climate.  We're also working on a home energy advisor service to help people make more strategic decisions and to connect folks with additional rebates and incentives to make improvements. And those recommendations will be based on a home or a business's assessment. And finally, we wanted to note that Ann Arbor did win a Clean Energy to Communities program award, which is a technical assistance grant that we are currently working on in collaboration with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.  Question six. Though the DOE is sunsetting their Energy Star program due to the BIL and IRA provisions, the EPA lists six upgrade categories that could be incentivized that would cover most of the previous question. Why place an extra financial burden on homeowners after passing the 20-year $6.8 million a year millage, which is $120 million in total, that they are already paying?  Why not use an incentive-based energy assessment that provides property tax credits for homeowners who voluntarily perform a certified assessment and ongoing credits for those who make improvements?  This is a good question. As to the requirement versus an incentive discussion, the OSI is taking the yes and approach. We're doing both. We are offering incentives. And we are seeking a requirement. And that is because according to research published by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory,  and incentive-based programs have little to no effect on the desired outcomes of HERD here locally. LBNL examined over 26,000 home sales that occurred after receiving a home energy score.  And among the many findings was that only in the cities where the home energy assessment was required to be disclosed at the time of listing, did they experience a positive market impact. Places with voluntary home energy score activities showed no statistical market benefit.  And we are using the community action millage, the climate action millage to fund the energy assessor and the additional market capacity to offer these assessments for no cost to the homeowner. So in essence, we are using the climate action millage to support this program.  Question seven, as real estate associations contract out with third party for their MLS have you spoken with rapid Tony the company that maintains the listings to find out the logistics and timeframe of adding this extra category.  No, the OSI did not speak with Rapitone directly, but instead we used the National Association of Realtors Guide, known as the Green MLS Implementation Guide. This guide was designed to help MLS staff implement certain fields in the MLS that are dedicated to information about a home's efficiency. This guide offers technical guidance, best practices, and a whole lot more to make the process as smooth and as easy as possible.  Thanks for hanging in there. Just a couple more here. Question eight. Was Laura Orta, Director of Organizational Equity, consulted about the ordinance? If so, what were their recommendations and concerns and how was that addressed? Director Orta was not at the city when this ordinance was created. However, we have shared the ordinance with Director Orta and await their feedback.  Question nine, which realtor companies were consulted during the decision making process for implementing this program and how are these conversations initiated and conducted?  In the drafting and reviewing process of this ordinance, OSI staff met with the Ann Arbor Area Board of Realtors, Reinhart Realtors, I'm going to Howard Hannah tomorrow, as well as a number of individual realtors, many of whom, but not all, are either an eco-broker or hold an NAR Green designation, for instance.  Because these individuals met with me on their own time, I won't mention which agencies they were with, because I don't want to inadvertently misrepresent their agencies. But these, all of these conversations were in large part initiated either by myself or other OSI staff. Some of them were at the request of agencies who heard about, heard, and wanted to learn more. Some were in person, some were virtual.  But the goal was always to gather information about the real estate sale process and to better understand the relationship shared between Ann Arbor real estate agents and their clients. We use these conversations and other publicly available information published by the Ann Arbor Area Board of Realtors and the National Association of Realtors, as well as others, to contextualize the information that was shared with us by other communities with similar ordinances in place  to make this herd ordinance make the most sense for Ann Arbor. These were the additional questions that came in today, so thank you for your time."}, {"start": 6971.932, "end": 6974.553, "speaker": "SPEAKER_20", "text": "Thank you.

So I serve as liaison to the Energy Commission, so I just wanted to say, respond to kind of a couple of things that I felt had come up during public comment. Obviously this was something that, this is an ordinance that has been recommended by the Energy Commission. One of the critiques that I,  think that we've heard both in public comment and some of our communications is that Homebuyers are not going to make these improvements and obviously, you know, we have some data about what comes what happens in other communities But I do think that we need to note That this is a priority for our community We know that from our a to zero plan that from the 2018 inventory 23% of our emissions come from residential buildings We have a carbon neutrality goal  to be carbon neutral by 2030. That is an ambitious goal and it is going to take a lot of work for us to get there. We have residents who have supported a climate action millage demonstrating that this is a priority for them. They base that, we have our carbon neutrality plan that had  The engagement of 68 public meetings, 66 partnership organizations, and in that, the goal of reducing our emissions in our residential buildings is clearly stated as a goal. We know that up to 80% of energy consumed in buildings at times is wasted.  So, it's going to take a lot of different strategies for us to get there. This is not the one action that's going to help solve that, but it is part of the puzzle. The reality is that when folks move into a home, if they are armed with information about  with an energy assessment about how they can make improvements. They go out and want to make an improvement to their kitchen while they're beautifying it as well and bringing it up. They can also address the fact that there actually isn't insulation in that wall. I know that when I had an energy assessment on one of my homes, a place that I moved from previously, I learned that there was  Zero insulation on one of the walls. They just forgot Apparently so, you know It's it's really important information for people to have walking into a home And we are going to be there every step of the way to help make it easier for them to make those improvements So I hope folks will support this tonight Councilmember Harrison Councilmember Watson"}, {"start": 7142.838, "end": 7208.379, "speaker": "SPEAKER_06", "text": "I have a couple questions, I believe for Dr. Stoltz.

So the home energy score is, it's a regulated score by the U.S. Department of Energy. So what that means is we actually have standardization in both the training of assessors and in the information that's collected in these reports. And so that's different than going out and having someone do kind of this broad energy assessment. There's actually requirements for what has to be included and adherence to that home energy score. That gives us more rigor in the information that's coming back  We also anticipate doing spot checks of the scores for sure to see what's coming into the marketplace. And I'd add one other thing that you didn't ask about, but I think it's important to note. While today we're talking about the requirement for these scores to happen at time of listing,  We are actually working to have the entire marketplace get one of these assessments, because the ideal is when someone calls their realtor to say, hey, I want to list my house. The realtor's first question is, have you gotten your home energy score yet? Go do that. And if they say, yeah, I got it a year ago, that's still good. Check. You've hit that marker. So I just want to name that while we're talking about it in a pretty narrow vantage, from OSI's perspective, this is a much bigger move and encouragement in the marketplace we're trying to push forward."}, {"start": 7293.459, "end": 7293.759, "speaker": "SPEAKER_31", "text": "Thank you."}, {"start": 7296.102, "end": 7299.643, "speaker": "SPEAKER_20", "text": "Any further discussion?

Would is this a consideration and anticipation of qualifying for these rebates? And I mean, I think I'm in particular noting that there is a funding for home weatherization for low-income Home homeowners for upgrades So, can you speak a little bit to how you plan to reconcile what you're doing locally with what might be?

This is funding that would come back to residents to make improvements in their home. This was promised in the Inflation Reduction Act. What you noted is that DOE has opened up guidance for how the states can apply for that funding because they haven't yet. So in a dream world, what would happen is the local rebates that we're going to be administering through the Community Climate Action Millage would be stacked with the state's rebates to go further to help people make improvements in their homes and in their businesses.  We are a little ahead of the state and the timeline for that. So we are working really, really closely. We're helping the state put in their application, but chances are very high. This is slightly parallel to the conversation, but chances are very high that we will be rolling out our rebate program first locally until the state is ready, and then we will sort of stack on. But fundamentally, I think the important takeaway is the objective here in HERD is to let the marketplace, it's consumer protection, and then it's then to let  people coming into the community understand what strategic opportunities they have, and then we want to give them information to implement change. That includes incentives, that includes OSI's programs, and the rebates you just identified.

I do have questions about how, and I was also relieved to see that I think  If this passes, it won't start until January of 2024. So this isn't like in 30 days or anything. But I still have questions about how we ensure that the rollout is a success. I understand the need to make it mandatory, but I guess I'm just wondering, you know, it's one thing two years from now when people are familiar with this program, we've had the assessor at the city, we kind of have a marketplace that's ready, people are used to this process.

And then secondarily, I think this was in a council response, we are having conversations with the private marketplace to make sure that we're building the capacity because what we know is home sales don't happen equally every single day, that there will be times and seasons where there is increased demand and we want to make sure that we have the external capacity for that.

You know one of my major worries was our capacity to do this work and if one person can really sustain a new program and if we're introducing bureaucracy into a process that's already pretty not fun from the buyer or seller's viewpoint.  But in staff responses, I see that you've pointed to the plan to engage additional private sector assessors. Is that correct? Can you explain how and when and how quickly you plan to do that?

So that way our, our staff person takes kind of first  past, and when they can't turn around things in a timely way, and we're hoping that's no more than a five-day wait, we pull in the private sector to be able to meet demand. And we do have local assessors. And I do want to also point out that just who we have today is, that's great, and we have enough capacity today, but we also want to offer free training for our assessor community that doesn't yet have this training to make sure we're continuing to scale up the workforce, because we think we're going to be moving in this direction, not just in Ann Arbor, but across the region."}, {"start": 7684.994, "end": 7831.213, "speaker": "SPEAKER_06", "text": "Thank you councilmember watson So, um I I I wanted to just broadly say that i'm going to be supporting this tonight because What what got me?  all the way there, I think, was talking about this as the miles per gallon rating for a house.

And I think it would be easy for us to say some things along the same lines of  You know, people don't choose their cars simply on miles per gallon, but you can imagine what it would be like if we didn't have that rating at all, if we didn't know what the possibilities were for improving efficiency, and the fact that this goes above and beyond in kind of giving people a roadmap.  to get to a more efficient home. The other thing that I would hope, looking at that 30-month report from Portland when they put in their ordinance, I think they put theirs in in 2018, and I've been reviewing the 30-month report, but they talk about trying to make sure that this doesn't concentrate, violations of the ordinance doesn't concentrate in certain zip codes, doesn't concentrate in certain  areas that exhibit certain demographics, larger minority areas, larger low-income areas. And I would encourage us to do the same thing, to make sure that we're not unduly burdening those communities. But it will just have to be a consistent monitoring. I mean, we're not going to know right away.  I can't say the other thing in Portland, they know that people took them up on the waivers. 80 waivers were given out, I think, in the first year of the program. So I think the news from other cities is good, and I think that with some vigilance, I think we can get this to a place that will serve the residents of Ann Arbor well, and that will also respond if we're seeing, you know, those wait times go above the three to five days that are promised in our  In our documents here, you know, if we see those go up or if we see it's having a bigger impact, the violations are kind of clustered in only certain areas or clustered in or changing the prices of people's homes in a skewed way.

I have a couple of questions, and maybe a continuation of a question, because I know that we've kind of touched on this a little bit, around really just the capacity and the ability to scale. If the goal is to get  you know, every household in Ann Arbor assessed, and to get the score out there, and acknowledging that we are, this is just one of the tools in our toolbox towards our 2030 goals, but knowing that about, I think last year, about 1,200 to 1,300 homes in Ann Arbor sold, and knowing that a number of those will come back up again between now and 2030, and some homes in Ann Arbor will never be listed between now and 2030,  what is OSI's plan in order to make sure that not only are we moving forward to make sure that home buyers have this information during the purchasing process, but also that we're continuing to move across the city and get others to voluntarily participate in the program if we know that voluntary participation hasn't been super successful in other areas.  And if we are wildly successful, what is our ability to scale up with a single assessor? It sounds like we have some potential local private partnerships, but would we have the ability to continue to expand that as well?"}, {"start": 7918.902, "end": 7988.697, "speaker": "SPEAKER_14", "text": "Yeah, it's an astute question. So there's kind of a few different prompts to that, and I'll go quick. One is the Home Energy Advisor service that we're piloting right now in 14 homes, that's also offering this assessment. And so that's another kind of track. The intent there is a lesson learned from Denver, who has a similar climate tax, it happens to be a sales tax, is that when they offered rebates, they found that people went for the biggest rebate they could possibly get, whether or not that's what they needed.  So an example would be heat pumps. People were applying for heat pumps when actually what they needed was air sealing. And so this allows us to be really surgical and making sure we're getting people the right improvement to improve health, safety, greenhouse gas emissions, etc. So the Home Energy Advisor is another track that's going to be working in the marketplace.  The second kind of piece, and this is not holistic, but a piece of it, is our AmeriCorps members, which will be coming to council for approval. That grant, which we did win, should be at your next meeting. The idea there is that's a ground game. That's 10 people who can go door to door and talk to folks about these assessments and start building the movement towards getting these assessments early and intentionally in the process.

I think we always should be looking for data to find out where there may be more efficiencies that we can have or other focuses that we can take to make sure that we're responding.  I also want to just call special attention to the final bullet point in the resolve clause because it also requests an estimate of the total emergency costs incurred by the city. And I think that's important because we know that as each of these storms, these storm events occur, that there is considerable cost to the city.  Not all of that is just an emergency response because there was a storm. A lot of it is an emergency response because we have prolonged power outages at a time when we need to keep people warm, when we need to keep people cool, when we need to respond to sparking wires. And so I think it's really important to know we know that every one of these prolonged power outages comes at a cost to our city. We know that deferred maintenance costs by DTE are  are exacerbating those costs. And so I think it's really important for us to have an idea of what those costs truly are. And I will also note again that there is a federal FEMA report that indicates that two major storm events, the cost incurred by those ultimately would pay for burying power lines. We are at three major storm events this year alone. So I will once again call on DTE to  to seriously start looking at burying power lines and improving their infrastructure in our community. Yes, when there are major storms and there are high winds, we know that trees can impact power lines. That doesn't happen when they are not in the trees. So I would call on DTE to continue to make investments in infrastructure improvements because it has been sorely lacking. Any further discussion? All those in favor? Opposed?  It passes.

I tried to work with Gulfside Lake Apartments. They granted a judgment, which on the 17th, I will be evicted from my home, me and my son. So I've lived in Ypsilanti, Ann Arbor area since 2005. I do not want to have to move. I do not want to be homeless.  I've worked with all different facilities and everything, and basically the cost of living has gone up, but the cost of, you know, the income limits has not. So it's showed everyone that I make too much money to get help.  So basically, I've never seen since 2005, I've never seen the rent be as much as it now. It's $1,600 a month, which Section 8 does help me with a little bit of it. But I'm left, like I said, I'm just one hospitalization or car breaking down away from being homeless.

Good evening. This is Tom Stalberg calling from Lower Town in Ann Arbor. And I'm calling with regards to C1, which is a rezoning with conditions for the block bounded by State, Stimson, Henry, and White Streets, commonly known as South Town. The conditional zoning request should be denied for the following reasons. It is the kind of conditional zoning that the courts have  very clearly ruled against. And it would create significant possible repercussions to property owners and tenants from many blocks nearby in the area commonly known as Lower Burns Park. And there is a legal remedy. The same exact site plan could be approved in a different manner that would be legal. The way it's applied for is not, I suggest you speak with your city attorney about that for a more formal opinion, but this is very similar  So what happened with the Garnet, which was voted down because the conditional zoning there was not legal, but it was later approved with the exact same plan with the PUD. So let me focus on some of the ramifications of doing it this way. Right now, the city has decided that short-term rentals that are not owner-occupied should not be allowed, not permitted.  in areas that are residentially zoned. That would include dislocation, but it would also include everything along State Street between State and White as you go up north from here, Stadium, Granger, McKinley, Dewey was in there, all the way up to Arch where north of Arch it's already zoned for something that would permit short-term rentals. So you take all these areas that are not intended for short-term rentals per our law,  And if you approve this one with the condition, in this case, they're going to allow short-term rentals, but they're going to cap it to a certain amount. Conditional zoning for the next person that applies in one of these places up and down State Street, across from University of Michigan's athletic facilities, you can't say no to the next person because conditional zoning has to be voluntary by the developer. And you can't turn them down for not volunteering what the last one did.  30 seconds. You're backing into a situation where you're going to be forced to approve potentially downtown height buildings or a conversion of those houses, as is, into short-term rental situations, removing from our long-term rental stock in an area that, right now, it's mostly student rental, but there's also a lot of families that live there. So whether you're an owner-occupant or a tenant, we risk  losing long-term housing stock in favor of short-term housing by accident. If we did this deliberately as part of the comprehensive plan revisions, so be it. I'm not backing into it.
