I'm here on behalf of the NLG and the lawyers and legal workers throughout the state who make up our membership to express our outrage concerning the conduct of the Ann Arbor Police Department. Last Wednesday, July 12th, the volunteers of FedUp Ministries were, as they do each week, feeding our community from their free food truck at Liberty Plaza.  Officers from the AAPD used this occasion to arrest a citizen for a minor crime that was alleged to have occurred in another place and on another day. Their protestations to the contrary notwithstanding, this is not the first time the AAPD has carried out arrests at locations set up to serve the hungry and unhoused. We urge this council to take concrete steps to ensure that this is the last. No one should ever have to choose between food and their freedom.  Prosecuting petty theft cannot and must not be held as more important than the basic human right to sustenance. The good people at FedUp Ministries are an important part of the safety net that supports the most marginalized and underserved in our community. Using their work as bait for law enforcement undermines their ability to continue to serve our citizens and is frankly grotesque.  Where are our priorities? What do we value as a community? Are alleged violations of property rights truly more important than the human rights of our most valuable residents, our most vulnerable residents? It shows an utter lack of vision for this city to place law enforcement above all else. In what way was anyone truly protected or served by the Ann Arbor police last Wednesday? In what way did any of us benefit by making it more dangerous to feed or be fed in Ann Arbor?  Finally, let me point out that if we, society at large, citizens of Washtenaw County, or specifically this council, were meeting our obligations to all of our citizens, fed-up ministries would not need to be feeding our neighbors at Liberty Plaza each Wednesday. No one would be resorting to petty theft to survive. And the Ann Arbor police, regardless of their priorities, would have had no one to arrest last week. The police can do better.  This council can do better, both in supervising the police and in serving everyone in our community. And our community can do better. On behalf of the members of the National Lawyers Guild, Detroit and Michigan Chapter, we urge you to do so. Thank you."}, {"start": 749.427, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "text": "Thank you. Good evening. I'm David William Cohen, a Northside resident.  Say hello to the Huron River Water Trail. You are invited to keep the river healthy and beautiful. As people are getting outside in record numbers, the need to put leave-no-trace skills and ethics into action is more imperative than ever. I quote there from the permanent leave-no-trace plaque installed adjacent to the Argo Livery office.  Yesterday, the New York Times had an op-ed about the growing importance of  River recreation in our time of global warming, it focused on Munich's Isar River as green infrastructure, serving the needs and desires of thousands of urban residents. Ann Arbor's Huron River could have been included, a site of exponential growth of human activity, the centerpiece being the Cascades.  I love the cascades, the sound of falling water, the lovely walkway on the berm, the grasses on the banks. Sunday early, I watched expert kayakers practicing maneuvers. Recently, I encountered a young woman reading a book at the foot of the cascades amid dozens of tubers.  The city should be proud of the Cascades' amenity in 19- in 2012, converting a murky head race into an intended kayak and canoe playground as part of a costly project to save Argo Dam and Pond. I appreciate this. But the Cascades' plan failed in significant ways.  Three cascades that were planned became nine. Canoeing was considered hazardous, and canoers were redirected to an alternate portage. Not foreseen, tubing became number one. And ever-growing numbers were bringing their own inflatables, bypassing the livery office. So many people from a wide region seeking a blast at a very small site.  Overwhelming the Cascades neighborhood with traffic, parking issues, litter and drinking. Early on, neighbors began speaking up.  In 2012, police stepped up patrols to deal with the Cascades chaos. Parking restrictions were introduced, and council members seemed to be listening, even joining in with us to collect trash. Nevertheless, the issues of the Cascades traffic have grown year by year. I have two questions. Can the city bring a comprehensive approach to the protection of our neighborhood's security and well-being?  Would the city accept this chaos at other parks, facilities, golf courses, ice rinks, swimming pools, softball fields, special events venues? Thank you."}, {"start": 955.755, "speaker": "SPEAKER_03", "text": "Good evening. Greetings to the mayor, to city council, and staff.  The reason I wanted to come here tonight is to speak about the reparation initiative that the city council is getting ready to, I guess, initiate. I think that before you initiate a reparation committee, you should meet with some of the people that used to live here, that has been moved out of this community. You should listen to some of the pain and anger that they have regarding how they've been gentrified out of the community.  There are people that are born here that cannot afford to live here. You know, those are the kinds of things that I think when you're looking at reparation, you should include that in the conversation, because that's one of the reasons why we need that. For example, you know, we look at City Hall and the employment ratio here.  There's very few black employees here. If you go out on these construction sites, you don't see any black men. The kind of job that we used to do, the hard stuff, you don't see that anymore because they're good paying jobs. So people that really could benefit from that are not being able to benefit. So I think those are the kinds of things that you should look at when you talk about establishing a recreation task force. Because those are the kinds of things that you need to take into consideration. Because just to create an initiative, just  initiative is not something that is valuable. I would also like to speak to the issue. I think I read in the paper about a month, a month and a half ago, where there was a presentation made by the city administrator to build housing, I guess, attached to the city hall. And I think the statement was that there would be no low-income housing, affordable housing.  And I find that to be contradictory to what the city is about. The city should be looking at taking care of those, especially if we're going to be using city property to build housing. People that can't afford housing otherwise should be given an opportunity to live in the structure. After all, this is the people's house. We pay their taxes. We support this. So I think that to say that these units, whenever they are bound to come about,  would not be open to people with low income. I don't think that's morally right. And I would like to congratulate Sister Cynthia Harrison for being a part of this initiative. I knew her mother, I knew her father, I knew her family, and they would be proud of you for taking the initiative that you're taking. Thank you."}, {"start": 1117.95, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "text": "Good evening, Council. I'm glad that CA9 has been pulled from the agenda for further consideration. I'll keep my comments brief and maybe back in August once I see what the next iteration will look like.  As a part of Council of 2018 through 2022, I co-sponsored the millage for affordable housing. I also co-sponsored the resolutions to transfer the city-owned property to the Housing Commission for a nominal fee of, I think, $1 to build affordable housing. As we all know, this site has a long history of affordable housing. Affordable housing was there before  Things were torn down and left vacant So it was alarming for me to see that council had thought of essentially reneging on prior commitments While on council I was reminded that promises made our promises kept There was the 40 40 20 resolution which I tried unsuccessfully to overturn I  yet it was vetoed and promises were made and promises were kept. When the millage was passed, we all knew it was not enough money. We were gonna need hundreds of millions of dollars to address affordable housing, not just 120 or 150 million. It was just one tool at our disposal, a big tool to transfer city-owned property to the Housing Commission to build affordable housing.  In 2017 and 2018, we heard the value of leveraging dollars so that we can use housing tax credits to leverage 5 million for it to become 50 million. I am just here today urging this council to reconsider this thought, which I believe is a financial shell game. It is to free up $5 million from the general fund  to then spend on other initiatives and projects. Many of you campaigned, most of you, if not all, some were uncontested. But when you're out there, you hear from folks, affordable housing is the number one issue. And since COVID, it's even become more acute of an issue.  I urge this council to honor past resolutions and transfer this property for next to nothing to the Housing Commission. Do not go ahead with taking $5 million from the Ann Arbor Housing Commission. Thank you."}, {"start": 1308.818, "speaker": "SPEAKER_15", "text": "Real reparations, real fast, right now. Now on to my talk. At the last city council meeting, we heard from council member Chris Watson about how he is rightfully afraid of the police. He is rightfully afraid of the police. So you might guess that Watson would identify with Palestinians who are rightfully afraid of being kidnapped and killed by the Israeli military, not just pulled over.  But no, unless Watson is the one, and he cannot even make eye contact. There we go, eye contact. But no, unless Watson is the one getting pulled over and killed himself, he simply doesn't care who Israel kills with his money. Doesn't care at all, far as I can tell. Correct me if I'm wrong.  Israel was almost founded in Uganda in 1905, except the white settlers stopped the whole plan. So instead of massacring Africans, Israel went over and established itself in Palestine to massacre Palestinians. It could have been Africans.  Israel tried to give nuclear weapons, the atomic bomb, to apartheid South Africa to kill black people, Chris. To kill black people, Chris. But Councilmember Watson is too busy to care. Too busy crying like a baby over the sufferings of the European Holocaust, which ended in 1945. What a pitiful sissy. What a pitiful sissy.  He knows what white supremacist state violence is. He knows, but don't ask him for a Palestinian human rights resolution, or he's liable, oh, there goes Iyer, running away from the room. We're gonna talk about you in a minute. Don't ask him for a Palestinian human rights resolution, or else he'll get down on his knees and cry over the tragedy of white Europeans.  Over white Europeans. But white Europeans are not afraid of the police today. They don't need your tears, Chris. Palestinians need you. Do you think it's right, Chris, for Palestinians to pay for the Holocaust? Palestinians? Who gave you that sick idea?  Pitiful as Councilmember Watson is, Jen Eyre sitting there is worse. Eyre took campaign money from old friends of the Israel Defense Forces, and you know the IDF is just like the Ku Klux Klan, except you're paying them $3.8 billion every year.  And look, Ayer is now sinking the whole reparations boat for black people, trying to pit black and native people against each other and put them at each other's throats for reparations money. She wants the best and brightest minds to decide reparations. Who is that? Her consultant friends? Her consultant cronies?"}, {"start": 1513.96, "speaker": "SPEAKER_05", "text": "Okay. All right. Hello, Ann Arbor. I'm here to go over what has happened in the past couple of weeks. The last city council meeting, we, the people, managed to put the issue of reparations to black America on the table. These people here and their buddies before them, no one ever did that.  The people of this town put the issue of reparations on the agenda, on the discussion table a couple of weeks ago. And there is an article in the Ann Arbor News. You can go look it up and you can see how all these people are bellyaching about, oh, yeah, how they really want to do it. If they wanted to do it, they would have done it.  Like Blaine said, in the 1800s, black people were asking for reparations. They were saying, give us a mule and 40 acres and we would sustain ourselves. Did they give it to them? No. These people have no intentions of giving anything to blacks or red people or native people or anything, as much as they say they might, and they don't say it much, but anyway, they have no intention. We have to kick their ass into actually doing it.  So I want to ask everyone in Ann Arbor to come here, speak for reparations, and let's push and force these people to do it.  Again, as Blaine said, and as you can see from everyone who speaks here, the population in this town is not happy with the record that this bunch has. This bunch gets pushed into their places by the donations they accept from the ultra wealthy in this town. They take over the seats and they vote all of them.  with Mr. Mayor here, who is the man for, you know, deciding what goes and what doesn't go. So we want a representative city government. This is not representing the people. As you can see, after 20 years of just talking about  affordable housing. We do not have affordable housing, but we have a whole lot of luxury housing that nobody can afford, $800,000 minimum level of houses you can buy in Ann Arbor. That is a shame. That tells you clearly that this city council does not care about  Regular people, it cares about the rich. This city council doesn't care about blacks, but we have to force them to care. If they did care, do you think the university would be accepting 4% black enrollment? No, they would have been bringing it up to 10%, which is what they promised 50 years ago.  Any of these guys ever pushed the university to do it? No, they haven't. Look at the Ann Arbor now. Lefebvre said it. Many, many communities of black have been pushed out of this town because of these guys. So do not be fooled by them when they tell you, yeah, we will have committees, we will talk about reparations. No, they will not.  They will make sure that it gets grind down to the floor. So come here, speak for reparation, speak for Palestinians who are fighting, struggling against human rights abuses of Israel."}], "public_comments_2": [], "public_hearings_1": [{"start": 2833.003, "speaker": "SPEAKER_19", "text": "Well, good evening.

I don't have a long speech to make. I just wanted to say, I just wanted to take the opportunity to thank the countless stakeholders throughout the community that have supported the project since 2017 when it was approved. Without their support, and it continues to this day, we wouldn't have the profound public benefits that the project has yielded.  It's incomparable in terms of the sustainability, affordability, density, public infrastructure, property tax growth, and something that often just we forget to mention enough, I forget to mention enough, excuse me, is the reduction in the tax increment financing that we were able to achieve.  You may remember the project that was approved prior to ours that failed was able to secure a $40 million TIF commitment, and we were able to reduce that 75% to about $11 million and achieve far more in the way of public benefit.

I'm a resident at 1621 Harville, just up the hill from the 99 Maiden Lane development. And I wrote you a short letter on Friday. I hope you turn down the zoning change. And I took the effort  wondering why the project had taken on the characteristics that it had to go through the the city's Planning Commission documents the comprehensive plan and all the various elements of it and Every time I read one of them whether I start with a to zero and then I look at gas appliances or I look at the  transportation department saying they urge the planning commission to not approve. And then I look at the Northeast Corridor traffic plan, a document of several years ago, and I see how everything comes together there at the Plymouth Road, Maiden Lane junction. And there's no plan for the, there's no assessment of the traffic load.  And that person said in the city don't approve this to the Planning Commission And yet we have I just drove down Maiden Lane this evening and I look at it and I see no bicycle paths I see a sidewalk on one side a whole bunch of power poles From an aesthetic standpoint another consideration  not a good-looking environment. It doesn't fit with what Ann Arbor Design plans, again, in the Comprehensive Plan said. I could go on, but it just seems to me that something is seriously out of kilter. I look at affordable housing. I look at the multi-use aspects. Go back and look at the old Lower Town  commission plan of 2009 with what they thought was a desirable way to use what had been a great Kroger lot, drugstore, so on. But all that is gone. And we have something that's a very different use of the plan. So I don't understand. So I hope you don't approve the zoning and send this back to the commission for further work. Thank you."}], "public_hearings_2": [], "public_hearings_3": []}
