We want to know what our residents think about everything that we're doing in the course of our community. And over the many years that I've been on council, and surely before, and almost certainly after, we are going to continue with those community engagement efforts. But what we also know is that it's a privilege to engage with  engage with local government, that it's difficult sometimes to engage in local government, and that it is incumbent upon us to ensure that the great multiplicity of voices that are in and latent in our community have the same opportunity to come and engage and influence local government than had been previously the case. We want to make sure that our efforts are broad, that they're deep, and that they are truly and always welcoming.  And so we have asked a long-standing group to work together deeply and hard to effect an equitable engagement initiative and to issue our final report so that we may receive the benefit of it. And well, shoot, that's what's happened, exactly. And so I have this proclamation to this effect.  Whereas the city of Ann Arbor wishes to advance equity by developing a shared understanding of what equity means for city policies, guidelines, and practices to help Ann Arbor be a more inclusive city. And whereas demographic data collection of the past years has shown that community engagement attendees are not representative of the city's diverse population.  And whereas a 30-person steering committee was formed to represent new perspectives and to discuss how to implement a more equitable engagement strategy. These recommendations were formalized in the report, achieving equitable engagement in Ann Arbor. And whereas a multi-department team researched other communities' best practices, inventoried our current resources and practices, and facilitated with this steering committee for 18 months.  And whereas a presentation of the committee's recommendations was shared with the Planning Commission, Renters Commission, Human Rights Commission, Environmental Commission, Commission on Disability Issues, and to the Energy Commission for feedback. And whereas community engagement specialists, some of whom are attendee here, have already used the steering committee's recommendations to make budget requests and have received funding for a digital engagement hub and pilot liaison program.  Now, therefore, I, Christopher Taylor, Mayor of Ann Arbor, express the community's deep gratitude to the members of the Equitable Engagement Steering Committee for their commitment to advance equity and municipal goodness in the City of Ann Arbor's public engagement strategy."}, {"start": 468.805, "end": 479.329, "speaker": "SPEAKER_28", "text": "Thank you all.

I'm excited to be with you tonight to represent some of the work that's happening. I'm gonna share some screens. Just a moment. Just a quick...  Visual cue. Can you see this? Yes. Excellent. Fabulous. All right. Well, as a recap, there has been a lot that is going on, and this resolution can contain a lot of different outreach mechanisms, engagement techniques, and approaches. So this is pretty text heavy. I do apologize, but I wanted to make sure to cover where we stand.  Once again, thanks for the opportunity. The way I'm going to go through this presentation is first, I'm not going to read this. Do not worry, do not get stressed. This is broken down by each of the resolved clauses. So the first slide will be the resolved clauses that Council passed. The following slide that will demonstrate what we've done to address  of the points that have been identified. So I'll just note here, this particular action was about City Council asking us to work with the Michigan legislature to let them know our concerns, what we hope to see around energy equity broadly throughout the city. There's policy, there's education, there's some special working sessions. So in terms of where we are, and I should have said at the very beginning, I'd like to thank Assistant City Administrator John Fornier for helping me pull this together, our Fire Chief, Chief Kennedy for his assistance,  and our Director of Organizational Equity as well. You'll see lots of fingers all over our responses.  So in response to this particular one calling on us to work with the Michigan legislature, we have discussed this resolution with members of our delegation and other leaders in the legislature. And actually this fall, as we prep for fall lobbying efforts and looking at what different pieces of legislation are going to be brought forward or that we hope are brought forward, we have a special meeting. And this bill or this resolution will be centered in those discussions, especially as we focus on bills  related to sustainability and energy policy which I am actually delighted to say it looks like there will be many. So we will keep council posted as this progresses just noting that in the spring we were in budget cycle so there really wasn't a lot of movement on these kinds of topics it was very focused on budget.  In addition, staff are supporting a number of bills right now in the development and also in seeing them be brought to the floor. Those include many of the items that are addressed in this particular resolved clause. This is the advancement of community solar, expanding the authority of the Michigan Public Service Commission, which folks may not realize is actually heavily constrained by what the legislature grants them authority to do. So we are working to expand that authority.  There are bills around energy storage requirements and incentives. We're working on an increased outage credit. We're working on bills related to allowing microgrids, especially at critical facilities, but also more broadly. And there's even a bill to expand our statewide renewable portfolio standard, which we're excited to see.  and dare I even say there are bills that tie greenhouse gas emissions to actual performance in the utilities. So there's a lot of work that's happening here and hopefully we're going to see quite a bit of movement on some of these bills, if not all of them, a girl can dream, by end of this year.  The second resolve clause focused on working with the Michigan Public Service Commission. In particular, this is the regulatory body that helps set the rates and that our investor-owned utilities are accountable to. So these were the resolve clause here. A lot of this is about daylighting the concerns that we have, pushing our utilities to work significantly on reliability concerns, which I know we all feel pretty deeply every day, and then working on transparency.  which is critical for operations. So some of the things we've been working on here, we certainly have shared this resolution with our colleagues at the Michigan Public Service Commission, ensuring they were aware  of where council's pain points were, what you wanted to see as strategic opportunities. We also are formal intervenors in many cases, but I want to take a minute and point out we are intervenors in the rate case, which is the current rate case. Last Tuesday, our closing briefs were filed. Many city witnesses have had their testimony cited in public, including in the media. We see cross-referencing to the Public Service Commission staff pulling our testimony about the lived experience of Ann Arborites,  and the pain points that we have, many of which identified in this resolution in their own testimony and with other petitioners who've intervened in the case. So we'll be coming back to you as we know more. Right now, things are moving before the administrative law judge in that rape case. But we continue to intervene in cases, rape cases, integrated resource planning efforts,  voluntary programs, et cetera, to make sure that we're pushing as hard as we can in the regulatory space for greater reliability and more offerings for our residents. OSI staff also regularly participate in what are known as technical conferences with the Public Service Commission staff and utility staff. These are things that come forward either after a rate case or before where sort of the industry is thinking about big questions. So we make sure we have a seat at that table, and right now we're talking about things like  How should we be increasing reliability? Data access is a real problem right now. So what can we do while protecting individuals' data, but also making sure we have the information we need to be really strategic and surgical with the work that we're trying to do? What's the future of battery storage in Michigan? How do we get more people to adopt  energy efficiency practices, or how do we incentivize more distributed energy resources such as wind or small-scale solar, and many more things. So we spend quite a lot of time early in the process working with the Public Service Commission staff to make sure our constituents' concerns are heard and that we're representing all local governments throughout the state in this work.  We also submitted testimony explicitly arguing that reliability must be a factor considered in rate making and pushing for what's known as performance-based rate making. Excited to see that move forward. We've seen it go all ways in different states, but generally the concept here is that we believe our utilities should be compensated when they perform, not for subpar performance.  We've also submitted testimony on the outage map, which was explicitly called out as being confusing and hard to navigate in our testimony, but also in council's resolution. And then we are exploring some other pathways, including, as you know, things like the sustainable energy utility, the rebate program, direct installations to help improve reliability and resilience outside of work with the Michigan Public Service Commission.  The third resolve clause was about our own operations as a city and making sure that we're doing everything we can to include and enhance resilience and equity in our work around energy issues. So some of the things going on here, our office of organizational equity is currently looking to hire a customer service survey vendor who's gonna look at internal equity across the board, which would certainly include thinking about our energy system and the work that we're doing across emergency management or an OSI.  We continue to make investments, significant investments, in enhancing the resilience of municipal operations. That's including things like solar and storage installed on key assets and community centers. But here the idea, we can't go down. The city has to always be able to operate and provide the critical life-saving services that we provide day in and day out without disruption, especially during a disaster. So we're going to continue to make those investments. We have a lot of priority. We're doing a lot of work around this. And I'm really excited to see the transformations that are taking place.  We also are coordinating with other communities in the county and leveraging our mutual aid agreements to ensure that the support resources we need are available when we need them, and that we're also available to provide those support resources to others when they need them. And we do have monthly meetings with DTA liaisons across the organization to discuss our opportunities, our pain points, areas for work or greater collaboration. And that spans the entire organization, depending on what the topic is. Sometimes that's in the electric side. Sometimes that's distribution. Sometimes that's generation.  Sometimes that's in the regulatory space. Sometimes that's the gas system. So we make sure to cover the issues and the opportunities that are presented before us in those conversations. And we carry the agenda. The fourth resolve clause was about making sure that DT had space or inviting them into spaces to hear from the public about their pain points and what they're hoping to see broadly in terms of greater energy justice and decarbonization.  In terms of what's happened here, we are continuing. I'm sorry, I don't think I even responded. The actions are underneath here. Apologies, this is out of format for the others. We did have a GTA liaison present on August  2023 at the Energy Commission meeting. They presented on reliability, recent outages, and their plans going forward. In fact, if you're at MLive today, you probably saw reporting on that particular presentation. We also have invited staff from DT to present more frequently at the Energy Commission meetings so that both commissioners and the public have a channel to directly engage with and share their thoughts with DT liaisons as well as with our own Energy Commissioners as we're thinking about how best to advise City Council on work in this space.  And then lastly, this is sort of another category where it just authorizes the administrator to take actions to implement. But I'm using this as an opportunity to tell you some of the other things that are going on that weren't explicitly called out but are relevant to advancing energy justice, equity, and resilience. Here, of course, OSI is working on a number of new programs that you know about and some existing programs, such as our Solarize program. But we also have a commercial solar program.  We've been looking at the sustainable energy utility and there's more like the home energy rebates and the energy advisor service that are going to be coming soon. Those are really important ways that we can help the public get the resources, the tools, and the support system they need.  We do meet, as I mentioned previously, with DT, but we also have ad hoc meetings as necessary. And right now we're having meetings on upgrading our 4.8 kV system to a 13.2 system, upgrading transformers and substations so that we have more electrical capacity throughout the city, but also on key circuits where we anticipate growth happening. We have been pushing for undergrounding of wires, in particular in coordination with street projects. If we're already opening up a street, let's look at what's possible when we're doing that construction. And trying to co-design pilots for things  that to me make a lot of sense in our world, which are things like bring your own battery pilots. We have high battery adoption in our city and so we're a great marketplace to be testing kind of innovation and how those programs can be built and expanded throughout the marketplace.  We also work with the state's climate office quite a lot on statewide efforts to equitably address the climate crisis, especially around energy issues, and I didn't want that to be lost here because they're not the regulatory body, they're not the legislature, but they are sort of similarly staffed to our office and we want to make sure we're coordinating where we can.  And the last few things, there is one more slide. I do apologize after this, but we do have OSI staff that participated in an energy equity project community of practice, really making sure that we continue to think about and find ways to center equity and grow our own work in this space. We also chair our professional network, the Urban Sustainability Directors Network Energy Equity Learning Group.  And then just some other things I'd point out that may not always come in front of mind. Our 10,000 Tree Program runs a community tree planting initiative where we actually plant much larger trees in underserved, under-canopied areas. And that has significant energy savings potential, not to mention a whole bunch of other stormwater benefits, health benefits, air quality benefits, et cetera. And then we've got our Home Energy Advisor Program that just finished its pilot. We're going to be releasing an RFP hopefully later this week or next week for a third-party administrator so we can scale that.  We're looking at thermal energy networks as an opportunity to reduce energy burden, increase comfort, and enhance safety. We've also got an RFP that'll go out in the next two weeks or so for a rebate administrator so we can get those rebates from the Community Climate Action Lodge out the door. We're working on the Home Energy Rating Disclosure and the Green Rental Housing Ordinance to help protect residents from energy burden. Then of course, OSI, EM, Emergency Management, and the Ann Arbor Housing Commission work really closely on expanding resilience hubs. That includes a grant that we're exploring right now.  to add solar storage and other decarbonization techniques to almost every single housing commission community center. And then I'll just end, I don't think most people know because we haven't done a good job in OSI saying this, we just released a toolkit for multi-unit developments on how they can enhance solar and EV access because there's different challenges that they face than a single family residential homeowner.  And then we always fundraise to try to support people with making these these improvements because we know that it's not equally accessible to everyone. So thank you for your time. I know that was a lot. But the point is, there's a lot going on on this. Thanks."}, {"start": 1339.355, "end": 1377.847, "speaker": "SPEAKER_29", "text": "Thank you.

And I'm calling about CA9, the repayment of the bonds for the old Y lot. I'd ask that you pull it from the consent agenda and discuss it. The millage, you know, governmental accounting is a little bit different than regular corporate accounting. I'm a treasurer for a nonprofit, so I have to deal with some of the aspects of that.  When citizens vote for a millage, there's specific items in that language on what the money is to be used for. And there's certain expectations that come along with that. So I think it would be helpful for the citizens to hear the complexities of this issue and to understand and be satisfied or not with how this matter is being handled, how our millage money is being spent. This is nearly one year's  one full year's amount of the affordable housing knowledge that we voted in. And one of the things that was said and that our expectations were based on is the idea that we could actually get affordable housing built if we did it on city-owned lots because we already own the land. Well, if we're having to pay for that land, that starts to make that a little bit more complex. And one of the other things we talked about was  not having the units sunset, revert to market rate, because it's a city owned lot. We can control that. But there's a possibility here of building about half market rate units and about half affordable housing units. And the possibility that some of the lot could be sold. So it'd be sure nice to know, you know, if we pay now that affordable housing knowledge,  or to pay down the debt here. And then market rate housing is built with half the money come back to the affordable housing note. If the land is going to be sold, how do we know that the units are going to be there forever as opposed to some setting? You know, maybe it's all worked out, but it'd be great for the public to hear you discuss that. So I've asked you to pull from that consent agenda so we can have that conversation. Um,  I'd also like to talk about the affordable housing in general. One of the ways we get affordable housing money and affordable housing units, besides our millage, is through PUDs. And there have been PUDs that provide actual units, and a lot of them provide payment in lieu. We are in jeopardy, very shortly, of approving a development that is approved as a PUD. 30 seconds.  would provide 33 units of affordable housing. Now, I sure hope it doesn't go away that Lower Town did, where we lost 93 units of affordable housing to nothing but corporate profit. In this case, I've heard some arguments why South Town should not be approved as a PUD, but I've not heard a single argument that legally holds any water whatsoever. And it will cost us 33 units of affordable housing and great legal exposure to the city. Thank you."}, {"start": 1578.387, "end": 1588.393, "speaker": "SPEAKER_29", "text": "Thank you.

These photos I'm going to show you  are of a school crosswalk, a school crosswalk that's used, a school crosswalk that has been in discussion since 1996 when the city hosted a community hearing. Why do we still have a sign here that you can hardly see, and this right here shows what the crosswalk sign looks like  for the opposing traffic, and the other crosswalk sign is over here and not even legible. Now, this is not a complex problem. This is not like sustainability. This is not like all of the issues we're facing with A20. It's just a very basic process. But Ann Arbor doesn't seem to like basics. So anyway,  Got ahead of myself. I have talked to the mayor. I have talked to council members one-on-one I've entered a to fix it tickets and it's obvious that the city simply lacks the political will and operational capacity to maintain safe school crosswalks For this reason I plan to use the same model  that community members used in 2016 following the death of a student in an unlit crosswalk. Concerned citizens formed A2 Safe Transport and effectively advocated for improvements in the school walk zones. The city responded by adopting A2 Safe Transport's plan and allocating millions of dollars for crosswalk improvements, lighting, RRFBs, consistent signage, et cetera, to improve the school walk zone.  Today, I encourage community members to join together and apply for a SAC grant as a chapter of Families for Safe Streets, an established nonprofit to address obstructions in the public right of way. There are three goals. One, to create a community education program.  because most people don't understand the public right of way. In fact, some people on the planning commission don't understand the public right of way. Two, to develop a roadmap for the city, what we need to do going forward.  And I think we need to be very prescriptive because the city is still having trouble flipping crosswalk signs.

And this is all I think about because it's happening, and it's real, all right? What motivated me to be here today is I woke up and I looked at the bond market, the 10-year yield, okay? Now at 4.3.4%.  And it keeps going up, all right? Why is it going up? Because the market's pushing it up. Why is the market pushing it up? Because of inflation expectations, all right? A currency crisis is when the currency that we use loses its purchasing power. This is municipal because this applies to society, okay? This is our community that we need to step in and help. Loses purchasing power. It stops functioning. It doesn't work like it used to. And this manifests in rising prices.  And this added cost of living essentially makes everyone poor. Everything we used to take for granted is now more expensive, mainly the things we really need like food and shelter. As the currency continues to erode, life gets harder, resources get stretched, the cost of everything keeps going up. Inflation precipitates societal decline.  59% of people with student loan debt have said that when student loan payments resume next month, that they will need to make a choice between making their debt payment or buying groceries. Credit card debt is now over 1 trillion and rates keep rising. People are at the brink. This is an emergency and we need to step in and do whatever we can to help our community.  We need to reduce the cost of living for our residents. Yes, we need to reduce taxes greatly. Reduce the size of government, I'm sorry. Reduce the city's debt burden, reallocate expenditures and human resources into providing essential safety nets to help keep our people productive, happy, and healthy. We need to empower people to keep their homes.  We need to develop a self-sustainable economy based on conservation, rural production, and agriculture. We need to make sure our people are fed. So, I study this a lot, and I'm fairly convinced this is what's happening, and it's pretty scary. So I want the city to  at least consider these words and what this could mean for our future. Because I think everything is going to have to be rethought. All our expenditures, what we're doing with the money and where it's going, it all needs to be rethought before it's too late.

I'm here for two reasons tonight. One is to express my appreciation to the council for continuing to pursue reparations for blacks in Ann Arbor who have been disenfranchised over the years. And I think that you're headed in the right direction when you're talking about putting together a task force to address this particular issue. I just hope that it doesn't become an unending task force that goes on and on and on.  And eventually it dies out because people lose interest in it. So I would hope that the council would move at a quick speed to put together a task force to address this particular issue because it's a very, very important issue, at least to me.  From my perspective, it's a very important issue that blacks be reimbursed for efforts that they put into this community but have not been rewarded over the years. The other thing that I'm concerned about is reading the papers yesterday, there was a comment about maybe Native Americans should be included in this initiative as well. Well, let me be clear. I'm not opposed to any group seeking reparations for their community.  But I am opposed to including other groups into this reparation initiative for blacks, because there's been initiatives that have been stimulated by blacks in the past, and we've been the least to benefit from those. Other groups have benefited from the efforts that we put forth to bring about change for our community, but it's only benefited other communities as well. So I would be opposed to any, I would like to dip in the butter right now,  You know, any effort to include any other group in this initiative that is designed to produce reparations for the African-American community in Ann Arbor, Michigan.

I'm here to speak on CA12, the payment in lieu of taxes proposal for a development on Stadium Boulevard on an old car dealership lot. I'm happy to see the progress to our new TC1 zoning. We'll have its first residential  option, an option that was not available before that was done. So that's a real sign of progress. I will note the challenges of building housing on what is almost certainly a brownfield site. Car dealerships are not known for, I guess,  Car-centered businesses in general are known for their pollution of groundwater and other things. There's a whole bunch of concrete on the site. There's going to be a lot of work to clear it and prepare it. And I would not be at all surprised if the Brownfield Commission or the body as a whole will have to deal with that at some point in the future. I don't have any special knowledge, but that just seems to be likely.  I'm looking forward to more neighbors on that site. It's been bleak for quite a while. Most of it was cleared. There was a building, a five-sided car dealership building, which I'm sure someone thought of as historic at some point in time. But now it's just bare and vacant. And I'm looking forward to the efforts, which I'm sure will be complicated and involve details of public finance that are beyond me to make it all work.  I will say that the city does have a history of successful transition of car dealerships to other uses, just like we have a history of transition of gas stations to other uses. And I'll point as an example to the Whole Foods site on Washtenaw that if you have a long memory, or if you don't have a long memory but have looked it up somewhere, used to be a car dealership there.  So it's entirely possible to take a site that was acres of parking and turn it into something that's a dense use.

I think probably the answer is yes. So if so, they are holding a public forum on Thursday, September 7th, from 6.30 to 8.30 p.m. It's a free event. They're going to have experts from Rewiring America, Michigan Saves Lives, and McNeely Building Group, and they will share practical advice on how you can access federal incentive money to make energy improvements and how you can  Yeah, save carbon and save cash. So again, September 3rd, Thursday, 630 to 830. It's live and on Zoom. The live location is 1919 South Industrial Highway. I want to inform Byrd Road residents and owners that there is a  phase two traffic calming study going on, if you are affected, and it affects not the dirt parts of that road, but the paved ones, and you'll be getting a mail form to either fill out and send back or fill out online.  I see no one looking up, so none of you here lives on Bird Road, but maybe someone who's watching is, and I want to just call out something about CA11, the consent agenda item to authorize the sustaining Ann Arbor Together grant program, and I am just so exciting. No, I am not exciting, but it is exciting. I'm actually boring, but  Some really wonderful grassroots activities have been accelerated by this. Among them, the reuse return container program through the restaurants had a seed grant from here. The Northside Resilience Hub was seeded through this program.  There was a grant to the Ann Arbor 2030 District, which is working on climate neutrality, and they launched a pilot collection of energy and water benchmarking for commercial properties, and this helped inform the city's ordinance on that. And then Arrowwood Hills Power of the Outdoor Classroom allowed the construction of an outdoor classroom at Arrowwood Hills, including the integration of solar power  into the classroom to teach youth about clean energy.

We purchased 200 kilowatt batteries, which are further gonna help us meet our peak shaving goals.

Some questions came up regarding CA6 that were, I guess, a little kind of tangential to it, not necessarily direct with the  agreement itself with Dearborn was my understanding. The two questions, one of which kind of related to longer term fire service planning, and the other related to the relationship of fire services between the city and the University of Michigan. As with most tow and gown relationships with the university, it's a little complex. The first part is from a direct funding perspective, the city does not receive any direct payment from the university for fire services.  what the state of Michigan has, and by default with U of M being a public institution, the state of Michigan has a program where they fund money to local governments for fire protection, and it's based on a  basically an SEV of what the property is worth. Now the challenge there is what is the taxable value of Michigan Stadium? What is the taxable value of University Hospital? So the basis of the funding mechanism itself is I think challenging at best because  U of M creates that number for us. We don't create that number. So that number is done outside the assessor's office. So that's the initial challenge. For the last several years, what that equals to is about 10 per the state reimburses the city, or reimburse might not be the correct term, provides funding to the city, which is about 10%. So for fiscal 23, it was 1.9 million.  And again, that is a state of Michigan program, not a direct U of M program. And there is a formula that's used is how that is generated. The second part that is more informal, and we've tried extensively to find a formal contract with this, and one does not appear to exist, is the relationship of the city and Fire Station 5. Fire Station 5 up on North Campus, that is a U of M owned building. It's on U of M property.  Since the late 60s, the city has operated a fire station out of there. They provide utilities, we provide the truck and staffing. So the station is desperately need to be renovated. It was at a time where women firefighters didn't exist and it is the oldest station that we have city employees currently operating out of. So that's the  I guess the fiduciary between the city and university. In terms of fire staffing with density and development, both in the downtown and with the university, some of those issues were covered in the fiscal 24 planning. One of the biggest issues we're dealing with is the density and the vertical growth in the downtown.  the need to add what we're kind of terming as a high-rise unit, basically a second unit downtown that can help address some of the vertical challenges. Fighting a fire on a one-story, 1,500-square-foot house is a lot different than the 10th story of a student high-rise. And so that's an upcoming challenge. There's initial vehicle costs with that. And then to staff that with 24-7 coverage, that would be a 12-FTE.  Request in and we're estimating that probably north of 1.1 million for a recurring cost We're also seeing an expansion of our ambulance transport unit, which was authorized by council earlier this year We're continuing to monitor that that's also a Definitely a horizon challenge and then a lot of the facility challenges that have been addressed mainly the replacement of station for on here on Parkway, so those are a couple of the  horizon issues that we expect with fire services."}, {"start": 3251.976, "end": 3252.537, "speaker": "SPEAKER_12", "text": "Thank you."}, {"start": 3252.537, "end": 3381.804, "speaker": "SPEAKER_29", "text": "Thank you.

We are not able to do that unless we go out to the neighborhoods and talk to people. We go out to the residents and communicate with them and tell them what it is we're doing, what it is that they can do, and how we can all work together.  use of AmeriCorps folks, AmeriCorps volunteers, is going to be a game changer for us.

So even though we're a separate public body corporate, we are a component entity of the city. And so it would be similar to asking a different department besides engineering to do engineering work. So we are that part of the city that is tasked with doing this work.  As far as the city keeping ownership versus selling the property. This particular site and other sites, this particular site has a long history of city acquisition, RFPs, developers, failed developments, RFPs that went south. And so it is a  I think for the city to maintain ownership as the developer, just because of our history of having a hard time getting sites developed, working with the private sector, projects tend to take a very long time. They can take five to seven years, and there's constant change in the political feelings of council members, of the community,  And so if we actually really want to get a project developed, it should be put into the hands of an entity that's not the city. Like I said, we are a separate public body corporate so that we are able to attract  and work with a development partner that does not have to worry about changes in what happens in the political environment on like site plans and funding and things like that.  That's just the reality and what we're hearing from the private sector on the risk of doing development in general in the city of Ann Arbor, particularly when the city maintains ownership.

My background includes participating in the Development Natural Features Subcommittee for the 1995 Ann Arbor West Area Plan. That was a long time ago. And being a former planning commissioner for Ann Arbor Township.  In all these activities and others, including the latest Ann Arbor Planning Commission publicized notice, recommended R1A.  I continue to agree, so did not attend the Planning Commission meeting, never thinking that anything else would be different. I consider a Blanket R1D zoning an inappropriate and would like City Council to respectfully consider Properties 2775 and 2737 Newport Road be changed to the original staff recommendation of R1A with the following reasons.  It's consistent with the present land use element of the comprehensive plan and R1 zoning. It's consistent with the surrounding zoning of R1A in the city, but also R2 in the township. It's a smooth transition from township to city density, as these are the first two properties coming into the city.  These properties on Newport Road are on or very near a dangerous curve. Accidents have occurred. To have that small corner be built out to 12 dwellings on a 1.7 acre lot would increase the likelihood of an accident with limited sight lines and it's irresponsible. Council might also consider parkland for the Rudolph Steiner property.  as there is already a 1986 memorandum of land contract which includes an easement in favor of the public for the use of existing and future exterior playground and nature areas on the premises.  R1D will drastically increase the impermeable surfaces on the hilly terrain from the present percentages. Existing rain gardens on the school property help control water quality, retention, and detention. The township and the city have a water sewer agreement.  There is a water T valve on the west side of the Steiner property to be used in the case of emergencies to provide water to the adjacent township properties without being annexed into the city.  Is there enough is there enough line capacity for the present load future build out at our one D levels and the township subdivision.

Thank you."}, {"start": 4187.627, "end": 4373.998, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "text": "My name is John Paul Wolf. I live on Newport Road in Ann Arbor. I work in commercial real estate, so I've been before councils like this, usually asking for a zoning change or a variance. But when in those positions, I've worked with city officials to ensure that our goals are aligned and that changes are in keeping with the surrounding areas.  Never have I witnessed municipal spot zoning indiscriminately like we're seeing today, especially against the will of the actual parcel owners. While I understand the directive to increase density, there's a right way and a wrong way to do things. And I feel that this is clearly a wrong way to do it. My family and I moved to this area  about six years ago because of the lack of density. The larger lots that make up the area, land around us had already been developed in a thoughtful, consistent manner. There was nothing to indicate or feel that our area would change. You know,  The extreme zoning change that we're talking about here today will negatively impact the quality of life for the people in the surrounding area. As alluded to previously, Rudolph Steiner is the largest parcel that's up for spot zoning today, and they signed a petition against that zoning change.  When these, and again, while it was mentioned previously, when these properties were annexed, the point was to join with a R1 zoning designation, not an R1D zoning designation. By changing it to R1D, it completely contradicts the essence of that approval and of that recommendation.  The anticipated zoning change from R2 to R1A is already increasing the zoning density from one house per acre to one house per 20,000. So it's already doubling it. Now we're talking about going to almost nine homes per acre. It's completely out of touch with surrounding areas.  Additionally, not to my knowledge, again alluded to before, there haven't been any traffic impact studies done. There's been no watershed, no environmental impact studies done, which would be required if a developer brought this to you, right? You would say, show me all these reports showing that someone's not going to get run over, that environmentally it's sound.  You know, but none of that has been done, not to mention the fact that there's easement rights on the property. The biggest property that you're trying to include density on, you can't even do it because there's easements already on the property. I think in general, it just shows a lack of forethought that was done in this. It's sort of a system wide, just increased density. And again, sort of not what we're looking for in this area.

I came tonight to ask you to zone 2775 and 2737 Newport Road as R1A for several reasons. The people, the wildlife, and the heart and soul of the city itself.  Ann Arbor is a place that has the benefits of a city while being in nature. Since the pandemic, cities such as San Francisco have been extremely threatened, existentially threatened, with work from home workers leaving and moving out to places that are less expensive and more rural. In San Francisco, property values and tax revenues have plummeted.  Apartments lie vacant, businesses such as local coffee shops, hair salons, clothing stores, and grocery stores have closed, and everyone from business owners to landlords to janitors who once cleaned these now-closed businesses to the city itself that is now collecting far fewer taxes has suffered. It is widely believed that that city will never fully recover. So far, this hasn't happened in Ann Arbor, because Ann Arbor is lucky enough to be surrounded by trees.  to be a city that feels like it's in the country. If the city starts zoning properties to have higher density of housing, it will lose this appeal and people will flee. They will work remotely somewhere else, buy coffee somewhere else, buy books and groceries somewhere else, and the city will cease to exist as we know it.  In the short term, schools will be overcrowded. Taxes will go up to pay for the extra services, for the extra citizens, and there will be congestion on the roads. In the long term, the schools will be empty, property values will go down, and we will likely never recover.  As for the wildlife, I'm sure that you are aware that there is an overpopulation of deer in Ann Arbor, and they are sick due to a lack of food and natural predators. Human development caused this problem. The denser the human population, the worse it will get. Not just the deer, but other animals and native species will be killed off, and those sorts of changes tend to have disastrous effects on the environment as a whole.  Currently, there's an informal wildlife and conservation corridor coming down the hill, starting at Skyline and going to the river. This runs through these properties. A zoning of R1D would stop this daily animal movement with the potential of causing irreparable damage to the ecosystem.  If properties like 2775 and 2737 Newport Road are rezoned for a higher density of housing, the essence of Ann Arbor, what makes the city desirable to live in, what makes it a place that draws people here and encourages them to stay will disappear. Wildlife will get sick and die and people will abandon the city. Those who will ultimately pay the price will be the lowest income workers who won't have businesses to work in and the city itself.

I think the last time I was at City Council, Jerry DeGreek and Kathy Kosashenko were on council. So it's been a while.  Anyway, I'm new to the neighborhood. My property is on the very north edge of this district. I love the rural feel of Newport Road. I've been taking care of neglected property there for the last couple of years, cleaning up the woods, and appreciating all the wildlife that currently live there. And they're allowing me to be there on occasion.  I agree that R1D is not appropriate for my lot or the school next door. Increasing density to some extent might make some sense. I could see R1A or maybe R1B.  That kind of density is just not in keeping with the neighborhood where all the lots are about half an acre. This would just increase density beyond what makes any sense from an aesthetic or safety standpoint.  I would say that it's in my financial interest to just go along with R1D, but I don't think that my financial interest is the most important consideration in this situation. So I respect my neighbor's concern for  increasing density beyond anything that makes any sense. So I just want to say that even as it is, I'm fairly new to this area. It's a major biking route. And people, you can't  There's no room on the side of the road even for bikes to get off the road when cars are coming. People can't walk there either because there's just no sidewalk. So increasing traffic in this area is really something you've got to think carefully about. The speed limit on Newport is 25 miles an hour. I was driving 28 miles an hour recently when a car pulled around me crossing the double yellow line going about 45 miles an hour on a hill.  and just passed me, and I've seen people speeding there all the time. It turns out this particular car was a delivery driver taking groceries to Barton Hills for Costco. So we already have a traffic and safety problem, so I don't really think we should make it any worse.  Also, I think the school is a beautiful property. By zoning this in a way that gives the school an incentive to sell out to a developer and move further outside of town because they could get millions of dollars for their property, it just doesn't make any sense. So I'd like to see the, at the very least, planning reconsidered.

Build sidewalks and calm traffic.  And you can easily support the additional density in this area safely. Nobody's going to make these existing homeowners split their lots but if a property only owner wants to.  they could in R1D and in the process produce four times as much housing in the same amount of area, helping to solve the housing crisis in the city. So please approve this rezoning at R1D and also please make changes to increase density allowable citywide.

Hi, this is Alex Lowe calling in from Southeast Ann Arbor. I must say I'm mildly disappointed with this ordinance, as I've already expressed to Planning Commission, but intend to express here again. As a city, we have a choice. Either we can allow a natural increase of density within city limits,  or we can force people out of the city, leading to longer commutes, more traffic, more emissions from cars, and contributing further to the absolute environmental catastrophe that we can already see happening around us, such as when this last month of July was the hottest month ever recorded.  Single-family homes on half-acre lots in the city, forcing people who don't have half a million dollars to drop on a two-bedroom house further from the city are exactly the sort of out-of-touch flaunting of wealth that led to the US being the largest contributor in the world to climate change. If someone has the money for that,  That's one thing. When we say, no, you're not allowed to do anything else, that's a problem. Why are we bringing in things where we're not allowed to build duplexes or triplexes? Why do we continue to create new property that we zone to only allow single family houses  on enormous lots. It's ridiculous. All of these should be allowed to have quadplexes by right at minimum. And if nobody on that street wants to do that, well, then nobody on the street has to do that. And when they sell, if the next person wants to do that, well, then they have the ability to do that.

We've been around for quite some time. And again, I'm speaking in opposition to the Heard Ordinance. And again, I do want to thank staff and council for listening to our concerns and really going through the ordinance itself and making some changes to it that do make it practical.  But I also want to point something else out that two weeks ago when staff was reporting, they brought up a really interesting point that was based from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory study. And as I researched into that, I found a couple of other studies. There's a lot of information on this topic. I'd like to read from one particular quote. This is from the Behavioral Perspectives on Home Energy Audit Study, also by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.  And it reads, despite success stories, the results of home energy audit programs overall have often been considered disappointing. Relatively few households undertake audits, and when they do, upgrade recommendations are often not acted upon. And though there is clearly remaining technology potential, little has been proven about the overall energy savings that results from audits and resulting upgrades.  nor the extent to which actual social behavior can reach technical potential. And I think the point is that this reinforces what the Portland 30-month report showed, and that was that buyers simply don't make upgrades and changes based on having an audit in hand. They're tapped out. Here in Ann Arbor, our average selling price year-to-date is $630,000.  up $30,000 from a year ago. Prices are climbing. When someone buys a house, they're all in. They've spent it. They really don't have dollars to put into it. And then also, the way that we're looking to implement this really has a tremendous cost. We're hiring a staff assessor. When we look at the expense of that staff, all in with  their benefits and such. When we look at contracting out for peak times, which probably will be at least half of them would be the assumption during those peak months, they're just simply not going to be able to do it. You look at administrative costs, technology costs, going back out in the end and really the enforcement side of it. This is well more than a $200,000 a year  venture into doing these 1,300, 1,400, 1,500 homes a year. So I would really just simply say that there's got to be a better way to do this. Let's find Ann Arbor residents that want to have this done and have the financial resources to be able to make the kind of improvements that you're looking for to help us achieve our A20 goals.

I'm a real estate broker and a manager of the Reinhardt Realtors office located at 2452 East Stadium Boulevard. I'm here to speak in opposition to the Heard Ordinance. I certainly do applaud the city's efforts to advance environmentally conscious and sustainable housing. I fear that the ordinance as currently envisioned sacrifices that goal in exchange for what is going to possibly create an unequal playing ground for the residents of the city of Ann Arbor.  In order for the ordinance to achieve its stated purpose, I believe that there are two assumptions which we need to take as true. One, that the purchaser of a piece of real estate is willing to pay a premium for a higher energy score home. And two, that that premium outweighs, is greater than the cost of pursuing those improvements that are going to be required to get that higher home energy score.  What homes are going to be able to take advantage of that playing field? Well, it's going to be the homes with higher earning income family members inside of that home. And as envisioned, the city ordinance would have a city employee operating within a city framework.  come and inspect a premises, not to give a pass-fail, as we might see on a building inspection or a building permit type inspection, but instead a valuation, a sliding scale number that is going to ostensibly add value or detract value from a particular piece of real estate.  So I have that baseline concern. Beyond that, I would call the council's attention to section 8604 of the ordinance which discusses several types of real estate which would not be subject to the ordinance, namely 8604.1. It's difficult for me to understand what this section is talking about. I cannot tell if it is related to the sale of one building  containing multiple units, or if it is related to the sale of a single unit, which is in a building configuration that would be stacked vertically. If it is that latter situation, it would create some incongruous results in certain neighborhoods. Take the Ashley Mews condominium development, for example. That's a condominium development that contains units which are both stacked vertically and adjoining laterally in a townhome configuration.  Under the current ordinance, to me, it would seem that some of those unit owners would be obligated to comply, whereas others wouldn't, despite their same relative voice in that condominium association and ownership rights within their units. Also, with respect to 8604-4, it broadly accepts commercial buildings. I don't see commercial buildings defined anywhere.  within the ordinance or elsewhere in the city code that is being pointed to. And then 86045 broadly exempts the same categories of real estate that would be exempt from the Michigan Sellers Disclosure Act. I'm not sure why that would exist. If we're going to have an independent third party come in and assess the property, the Michigan Sellers Disclosure Act relates to disclosures that would be required based on the personal knowledge of a seller. If we're not involving the seller in making this disclosure, I'm not sure why that's in there.

So we are asked to rezone 11 city-initiated annexed properties on Newport Road, Bird Road, and Victoria Circle from TWP Township to R1D. I want to thank everyone who participated and came for the public hearing. We've heard some very thoughtful comments about R1D. Many of them have focused on concerns about things that you feel could be lost.  It is very important to say that nothing will change on any of these properties unless they are sold and developed. Zoning itself does not change anything. It doesn't force any change. Now, it is true that planning staff recommended R1A, which is consistent with the surrounding properties. Planning Commission and City Council have discretion to reconsider staff recommendations in light of policy priorities.  Both R1A and R1D restrict development to freestanding single-family homes. As you have heard, the most significant difference between them is that R1A prevents you from building a home on anything less than a 20,000 square foot lot. That's roughly half an acre.  And R1D lets you build a single family home on a 5,000 square foot lot. To require half an acre as a minimum lot size for a single family home is a barrier to entry into this community.  Many people who live in Ann Arbor see this half acre minimum as a relic of a past that they no longer endorse. The resounding support for the affordable housing millage suggests that R1D is more in line with residents' values, priorities, and aspirations today.  Again, that does not mean that this rezoning will change anything. It will not, unless people choose to sell or subdivide their properties. Now by far the largest of these occupied properties, 2775 Newport Road, is owned by the Rudolph Steiner School and houses their lower school campus, which is enrolled to capacity  by students from preschool through eighth grade, and they have wait lists. R1D zoning will have no impact on this property unless Steiner sells it and it's developed. I spoke with their director, Dr. Owen Cruz, and I quote her. We have absolutely no interest in moving at all. We plan to be there for many, many years. In other words, no plan to sell. Gerald Alkin, owner of 2737 Newport Road, was here and spoke for himself. He would not take advantage of the additional density this zoning provides.  So let's turn to the vacant properties. There are two vacant properties, and if they were developed, the community would see at most 13 new single family homes on 5,000 square foot lots. One of the parcels is a roughly one acre parcel that could accommodate a maximum of four homes. It would be max two if zoned R1A. The other is a parcel north of 2118 Victoria Circle.  Commonly owned with an adjacent property that has a home on it if housing were developed on this property Ten homes are possible, but eight to nine are more likely given the constraints of a pond on the property It would be maximum four or five if zoned r1a.

B2, an ordinance to add Chapter 106, Home Energy Rating Disclosure to Title 8, Building Regulations of the Code of the City of Ann Arbor. I believe we have a staff introduction."}, {"start": 6193.287, "end": 6469.642, "speaker": "SPEAKER_33", "text": "Hello, Mr. Mayor and members of council. Thank you so much for the opportunity tonight. We have, I believe, five questions that were submitted. So the first question, if a person owns five properties and sells all of them, but doesn't disclose the herd assessment for any of them, they will owe $4,500, correct? That is correct. Herd penalties are 500 for the first offense and an additional 1,000 for each subsequent offense. Question two,  Wouldn't a city-employed building inspector already have the first-level certification for a HERS auditor? Could they receive training to become the auditors, or could the city hire additional inspectors and pay for their training?  response. The HERD ordinance requires a U.S. Department of Energy or DOE home energy score, which is actually different from a HERS rating. The OSI, as we've shared before and you heard in public comment, is hiring a full-time energy assessor to offer free home energy score assessments. Additionally, the OSI is prepared to subsidize the cost of training for non-staff assessors, as well as for staff, if they were interested, to become home energy certified. And we're prepared to work with the private sector marketplace to bring more assessors on during periods by demand.  Question three. In the current ordinance, it looks like the only revenue is if someone doesn't complete a herd assessment or disclose. Is that correct? Response, that is correct.  Question four, if the city were to perform hers assessments as part of new construction and renovation inspection instead of during a real estate transaction, would it be possible to get any energy tests like lower door tests or help with upgrading low scored items donated for homeowners who make up 60% AMI, have disabilities or seniors through a public private partnership pilot or zero energy home upgrade fund run by the city or as part of the community benefits agreement response?  New construction must adhere to the state's building code, whereas existing buildings do not. The HERD ordinance before council is about disclosing a home energy score on existing buildings, so we just want to differentiate. To the question about new buildings, right now the state of Michigan is considering updates to both the Michigan Uniform Energy Code and the Michigan Energy Code. OSI staff and many collaborators are working hard to ensure that we have a statewide energy and building code that protects public health,  safety, general welfare, and of course, our climate. If adopted, these codes will ensure that new buildings are much more energy efficient than what we currently have on the marketplace. However, since the building code is not relevant to existing buildings, OSI staff believe the H.E.R.D. ordinance is an important element of our landscape to ensure people live in safe, healthy, and affordable homes regardless of if those are new homes or existing homes. Put another way, the H.E.R.D. ordinance is only one piece of the ecosystem of work to protect consumers and help improve the energy performance of our built environment.  In addition to HERD, we have our work on the State Building and Energy Codes I just mentioned before. We have the Energy and Water Benchmarking Ordinance, which already requires multifamily and commercial sites to disclose annually their energy and water usage. We have the Home Energy Advisor Service, and we have the soon-to-be-released Residential Rebates, as well as the Solarize Program and numerous educational activities that we work on. Additionally, OSI staff are and will continue to explore options to further support residents, especially those making 60 to 80 percent AMI or less,  One such resource is the Inflation Reduction Act, which provides unprecedented financial assistance to all U.S. homeowners for efficiency and electrification upgrades. The tiered benefit structure starts at 80% AMI. The local rebates coming through our local Community Climate Action Village will take these IRA benefits even further.  And additionally, the OSI has already piloted two programs to provide homeowners with technical assistance and guidance for improvements. Those include the Aging in Place Efficiently program, designed to support older adults, and Home Energy Advisor program, I know we've talked about recently. Additionally, the OSI is already preparing a resource hub to help residents access these incentives and assistance programs when they become available. So these will stack with the herd, not replace it.  And fifth question, what in the ordinance is written shows that we are a data-driven city? How will we track the number of HRSA assessments if they go through a private provider? Not all real estate transactions go through a realtor, but all new builds and non-minor renovations do go through the city. The response, the OSI will easily be able to track the free assessments because they will be provided either through the OSI's on-staff assessor,  or through a contract with one of the local firms that we employ. For any assessment that's done outside of those options, as well as those done through those two options above, the ordinance requires homeowners to submit proof of their home energy score to the OSI director prior to listing or during the listing process. This allows OSI to track all compliant assessments and relevant scores. Thank you."}, {"start": 6469.642, "end": 6488.457, "speaker": "SPEAKER_29", "text": "Thank you.

This broader application ensures that all homeowners, whether they're buying, selling, or staying put, can benefit from enhanced energy efficiency. This postponement will grant us the invaluable time to reflect on these integrations and draft a policy that's best tailored to Ann Arbor's unique needs.

I am incredibly struck by staff's openness to suggestion and willingness to make changes in response to sound ideas and well-founded concerns and so there have been ideas that emerged in the two weeks between tonight and our last meeting and there is a list in the answers to council questions of the changes that were made in those two weeks and so  It seems to me that there's enough time to consider Councilmember Harrison's ideas in the next two weeks before our next meeting without a proposal.

That is to say, it has gone through  a wide variety of iterations with a wide variety of stakeholders and I think it's suitable for second reading and ultimate decision. Understanding that between now and second reading if indeed the postponement were not to succeed there would be an opportunity for folks to have amendments which then might be brought to the table and indeed accepted which would  would nullify that opportunity for a second reading and render a second public hearing moot.

And so that was just sort of a counterpoint to me that has been stuck in the back of my mind all day. And I think the second one is that when we look at housing as it is, we want to ensure that folks of all income levels have  a safe and healthy place to live and and heard to me paves that pathway so that We know energy-efficient homes are not only less costly to operate but safer for folks to live in and I think that those are two of the counterpoints to some of what we've heard around the table tonight that are Equally worthy of consideration as part of this conversation.

And from what I understand, taking a minute to digest and take in a little bit of extra input.  is what we're asking for here. One of the things that we've talked about a lot with this council, we are the most diverse council we've ever had.

One of the questions I asked was about the way that they used herd data in Portland. And they did an analysis to see if low herd scores were concentrating in certain areas of poverty or minority-majority areas.  to see if it was affecting housing prices. So one, they didn't see it affecting housing prices yet, but two, they said we're going to have to keep watching this on the question of is it adversely impacting minority communities. But the other point that was made is  sometimes we're gonna need this information to figure out how to target our subsidies. So if we don't know that people's homes are rated a one in efficiency, we won't know that they need subsidies that they're eligible for. So I'm wondering if Dr. Stoltz could comment a little bit more on how we plan to use this data to see if there's a disparate impact on equity."}, {"start": 7875.378, "end": 7938.557, "speaker": "SPEAKER_33", "text": "Thank you, Council Member Watson, for the question. There's a few different ways that we're thinking about this. One is having the data is really important, period, so we could be able to slice it and dice it in multiple different ways and understand if we do have disproportionate impacts to the positive or to the negative, and then present those findings back to Council and think about the adjustments that we need to make in that program.  Second, as we've mentioned a few times, this is not the only thing that we are doing. This is but a piece of the ecosystem and it's an important piece because it's data. It's information that helps us, I like the word, be more surgical. We don't have enough money to help every single household make improvements, but we really do want to center our  our frontline and fenceline populations, our low-income communities who've been disproportionately burdened by energy costs that are rising, or other sort of factors in their lives. And so having this information allows us both to direct people to things like the Home Energy Advisor that we're establishing, so they can get that support, or to the rebate program that we're creating. It's just another tool in the toolbox, is sort of how staff think about that."}, {"start": 7942.921, "end": 7966.658, "speaker": "SPEAKER_36", "text": "One other question, you've talked about the idea of something, of being voluntary as being, or, you know, being incentivized as also being voluntary, whereas this kind of making it mandatory, or, you know, making it mandatory is what gets us to the compliance we want.

I don't think anyone really wants to go to enforcement. That's never the goal or the objective, especially in something like this, where we're trying to actually make homes more efficient. So there's a lot of things that we'll be doing in the marketplace here, including education outreach. We're not just, I know we're talking about this because the ordinance itself is focused on time of sale, but we also are hoping to offer this and what we will be offering this.  in some way, shape or form, assessments for everyone in the marketplace to get their home energy score. Once they get a score, they're good for eight years or until they make major changes to their home. And so the idea is not just to put all the pressure at time of sale, it's to help the entire marketplace get this information so then we can have more informed decision making more broadly. We also know from research that voluntary doesn't work. We don't actually see any shifts in the marketplace.  And I would just add one last thing, which is this is not a performance requirement. So I've heard a few times people saying like, but people will have to make improvements. They won't. That's not the requirement of the ordinance. It's disclosure. It's truly consumer protection for people that are buying $620,000 average houses. Like that's terrifying. So how do we help make sure that people aren't sort of burdened in that space?

As I said, I am very excited to hear the results of the work that Councilmember Harrison, because we don't do that, has been doing. Sorry. I did have a question, picking up on some of the comments that were made earlier about disproportionate impacts. I do have a question for Dr. Stahls if she's still on.  It's about a finding in the study by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. And so this is their 2022 study based on over 26,000 home sales. Among their findings, as we have mentioned a few times, was that only in cities where the assessment was required to be disclosed at the time of listing was there an impact on the market.  And they found two impacts on the market. One was that a one-point increase in the home energy score in these locations was associated with a 0.5% increase in the sales price. So that's good for the seller.  but they also found that an increase in $100 of estimated annual energy bills was associated with a 0.4% decrease, which is not good for the seller. And again, so I wondered if it is staff's opinion that that is something that should worry us,  when there is a finding of increased energy bills, there's a decrease in price to the seller. And I think you've already, staff has already said this, but I just wanna make sure that this is something that we track and figure out if there's anything that we, how we, again, how we can target our investments to help folks who aren't able to lower their energy bills.

A lot of home buyers right now already have access to historical energy use data from.  from the utility and that doesn't tell the full picture. That in part does suggest that there can be an increase in the cost of the home, but the home energy score provides a much  a clearer picture of what's happening in the home. The energy use can vary from the resident to resident, whoever's living in the same home, but the energy performance of that home remains the same across the board.

The second is from studies that I was sent, and this is something that I can also talk to OSI about.  There were some factors that were pointed out in regards to disparities that I think are important to mention, which is that many in these studies were individuals who had the money and the time to improve their housing energy efficiency scores. And the article also discussed that many black neighborhoods have fewer houses just because of historical policies like redlining and housing covenants. And those homes are also older in these neighborhoods, which makes it harder to do energy retrofits.

We have, you know,  I'm not quite sure what a better term than foot soldier is, but we will have boots on the ground, students, AmeriCorps members on the ground who are eager to go out into neighborhoods where we learn through programs such as this that energy efficiency requires work and we have the ability to help provide that work through either grants that we are providing, grants that the  the federal government is providing or the state and so forth.

I was happy to co-sponsor and firmly support the resolution urging the Michigan State Legislature to ban flavored tobacco products, including menthol. Historically flavored tobacco, especially menthol, has been aggressively marketed towards black communities, leading to disproportionate health impacts on black and brown adults and youth. These products are deliberately tailored to appeal to our younger residents,  often acting as a dangerous prelude to a lifetime of nicotine dependence. Lower income communities are also particularly vulnerable, bearing the brunt of associated health costs and the cycle of addiction. By repealing local preemption of tobacco licensure and sales policies, we empower local municipalities to implement measures best suited for their communities.

Flavored tobacco leads to more tobacco use, worse health outcomes for these groups, and is a  conscious and intentional health tragedy in the making.

Public hearings are opportunities for members of the public to speak to council and the community about the specific subject matter of the public hearing. Folks do not need to have signed up in advance in order to speak at a public hearing, but your speech must relate to the subject matter of the public hearing. That is to say, the specific item on the agenda to which the public hearing relates.  Speakers, both in-house and online, will have three minutes in which to speak, so please pay close attention to the time. Our clerk will, or the table will, notify you when 30 seconds are remaining and when your time has expired. When your time has expired, please conclude your remarks and cede the floor.
