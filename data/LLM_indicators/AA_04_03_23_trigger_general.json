You know, when I stood here and spoke with you a couple of weeks ago, I did so as the vice chair. What a difference a couple of weeks makes. I am now the chair of IPOC. And so it is good to greet you in that  position. Just by way of introduction, since you probably don't know me, I have been practicing law here in Washtenaw County for over 45 years. I initially started with the county prosecutor's office. So I worked with a lot of police officers every day. From there, I came here to the city attorney's office. I was an assistant city attorney and then first assistant city attorney. And as such, I represented police officers.  When I retired from the city, which I think was 97 or 98, I went into private practice, and in that position, I sued police officers. I grew up in the city of Detroit, and when I grew up in the city of Detroit, the police could probably rightly have been called terrorists. We were terrified of them. They had an organization, I don't know if you've heard of it, the Big Four, would ride through our communities  And they had guns sometimes sticking out of the back windows of the cars, and we would just run. So I think I have a pretty well-rounded view of policing. And I am happy to be here in this position today. So what is it then that you can expect? Probably nothing new. I'm standing on the shoes of some very capable previous chairs of this commission. But a couple of things that I'm looking at, and you may be hearing more about later,  One has to do with our complaint review, and as you know, that's one of the main things that we do, is review complaints. Some complaints come directly to ICPAC, some others come through the police department. We are hoping to get, and we're backlogged,  We have not had an opportunity to review all the complaints. And I'm going to tell you exactly what we need because I don't, I get this from folks who work with it, but we are hoping to get the creation of a spreadsheet and a webpage. And as I understand it, this will allow us to post things that we are, our progress so that the community can know what we're doing.  and communicate between the information managers. And the vice chair now and I have a meeting, I believe, scheduled with the city administrator to see how we can move quickly with this project of getting our spreadsheet and everything up and running. So that's number one. The next thing we expect to do, you know, the police officers have business cards that they hand out if a citizen requests it.  Right now it identifies the officer and it's also information about victims' rights. We are hoping, and maybe it might have to be a double-folded card, we're hoping to add information about ICPCC. And so that if the citizen has a complaint or a compliment about a police officer, they can contact us. So that's something that we hope to get going. We are  Looking at, you know, the Bible says that the power of life and death is in the tongue. And I believe that to be true. And sometimes, you know, things are set in the initial confrontation between the officer and the citizen.  I hope to stress courtesy and kindness. And I think if we look at that first, a lot of things that can happen later and can escalate may possibly be averted. So hopefully we can build that into our training. And then finally,  You may be finally, not finally, that's all we're gonna do, but that's all I'm gonna tell you about tonight. You may have heard, you probably did hear about a study that was being conducted primarily through Eastern Michigan University with a grant that came down, sort of through IPOC. And it's my understanding, this is a study of traffic stops in the city of Ann Arbor.  And I wanted to give you a heads up, I think, I am informed that the results of that study will be coming down this week. We had hoped to see it before, but we have not been, we don't know anything about what it's going to, what the results are going to be. And so we do not, we're not promoting it, we're just letting you know. It's supposed to be presented to ICPOC and council  and the police department this week. So heads up that may be coming and maybe we'll want to talk about it more when that comes down. So thank you. Are there any questions? If so, I'm happy to answer them. Otherwise, that is all."}, {"start": 572.708, "end": 573.529, "speaker": "SPEAKER_10", "text": "Thank you.

I don't have to tell you, you know it, I'm sure you do, that this city council does not work for the public. They work very carefully and very, very long time for those who contribute to their campaigns.  The mayor sitting here right now last year got $90,000 in campaign contributions. His buddies sitting here and giggling all the time, they got $30,000, $40,000 in campaign contributions. You can be sure those who gave them hundreds and thousands of dollars in campaign contributions are not gonna sit and watch as they do stuff to benefit us. They want stuff in return.  Now, I tell you they don't work for us and they work for the rich in this town because Gilman is scot-free, has paid very little for the contamination, massive contamination of our waters. I tell you they work for the rich and not for us when we know for 20 years they've been talking about  housing and shortage of housing, still we don't have affordable housing, yet the developers are fat and nice. I tell you they work for the rich and not for us because after I made a big stink about $15 minimum wage during the past election time,  and discussions. And after this Miss America here, Dharma, agreed that we need $15 minimum wage. They still haven't installed it in Ann Arbor. Workers in Ann Arbor don't have $15 minimum wage. So they don't work for us. They work for the rich. We know that. This is still a limping liberal democracy. We can kick them out.  This is still a limping liberal democracy. We can kick them out. I invite you to come and kick them out next election cycle. Their human rights record is even more atrocious. They've got a lady here who cares little, if any, for Palestinian human rights. She has even less understanding of human rights commission in Ann Arbor. She's sitting there and, you know, saying yes to Mr. Mayor.  Yesterday, Mohammad Khaled Salabi was murdered in Palestine. He was 26 years old and he had just graduated from medical school. Imagine if a medical student right here in Ann Arbor was murdered by the police.  Israelis are murdering Palestinians on a daily basis. Now it's Ramadan and the festivities brings people to Al-Aqsa Mosque. And they find every opportunity to torture people, stop their access to medical care, and shoot them dead.  All I've been asking this esteemed group here is to say that they are against military aid to Israel. Yet they don't have the decency to do that. Kick them out. This is still not a dictatorship.

Here's why. Israel massacred thousands of Palestinian and Lebanese people and stole their land. Also, Israel sets the tone for how the United States treats Arabs and Muslims with mass murder. With mass murder, that's how.  So that brings us to Ann Arbor City Council, which loves to pass resolutions on global stuff, like a global warming, like animal rights, like goldfish rights, like the rights of deer. Look at your mayor, a big loud mouth for white Ukrainians. But never, never will you see him stand up for Palestinian rights. He has no heart.  Ann Arbor City Council has thrown its weight against every resolution for Palestinian rights for almost 40 years, since January 1984. Has this city council and this mayor ever looked at Palestinians as human beings? Ever? You tell me. As if there are rules for when you get to speak up for Palestinian human rights.  And the rule is never ever. The city council members sure seem to act like the rule is never ever. But 90 campus resolutions have broken that gag rule. Those resolutions insist on Palestinian human rights.  Amnesty International says Israel is committing the crime of apartheid against the Palestinian people. Human Rights Watch says so, too. Black Lives Matter says so, too. South Africa says so, too. And what the hell do you say? Not a goddamn thing. While Israel butchers the Palestinian people, you can't even make eye contact.  Israel is apartheid's last stand. So why is Ann Arbor City Council helping Israel to reload? To reload? Israel is so drunk with American guns and money that one of its highest officials has just said there is no such thing as the Palestinian people. And you say nothing.  Malcolm X said, stop talking about the South, as long as you're South of the Canadian border, you're South. Well, guess what? When it comes to Palestinian rights, the Ann Arbor City Council is way South, South even of the Ku Klux Klan. Ann Arbor City Council, your racist ship is sinking fast.  And I say, fuck you. Go down with that ship. Ann Arbor and the world will be better off after the voters throw you out.

Kind of I was thinking about like I know there's a public hearing for the PUD and it just bums me out that we have to do all these  you know, one by one project things to get our badly needed housing in the city. And so I've also been hearing from a lot of people. I'm just getting more into urban planning and stuff like that and asking people what their favorite cities are that they visited and stuff like that. And the most common answer that I get is Paris.  believe it or not. And um...  I really don't have a lot of money. I don't travel. So I'm like, well, instead of me traveling to Paris and checking it out, what if we made Ann Arbor more like Paris? And so what we could do is maybe aim for one million Ann Arbor residents, which still would have a significantly lower density than Paris. We would need, I believe, like,  1.5 or 1.6 million people to have the same density of Paris. But we could have really lively neighborhoods with lots of... What I wanna see is a lot of bigger apartment buildings with first floor activated space and  I think we're seeing in the closed streets for the summer are really winning a lot of people over the benefits of having more tables outside at cafes and restaurants and more programming, games for kids and special events and stuff like that. That doesn't have to just be limited to downtown. There's other areas in the city. We could give families that  maybe don't want to, that live far out from downtown and don't want to bike ride all the way through to downtown or something if they have another kind of a track, activated area of the city closer to them. And it just brings more creativity, more different types of people, and  it will help the environment.

I urge you to allocate the city's revenue from the county mental health and public safety millage to the unarmed response program.  The appropriation for millage funds of about $2.8 million per year would be in addition to the American Rescue Plan Act funding of $3.5 million. I will give two of the many reasons this would be good policy. First, the expansion of unarmed response will be another step forward in improving the quality of life in Ann Arbor.  Everyone benefits from living in a community where all people feel that others care for them. In the words of Martin Luther King Jr., quote, our goal is to create a beloved community, end quote. A beloved community is especially important to those who live with a serious mental health issue, those in poverty, and those bearing the brunt of racial, ethnic discrimination.  Second, the use of the millage funds for unarmed response would increase the chances the millage will be renewed. Many, and perhaps most, people believe a millage labeled mental health and public safety on the ballot should be spent on mental health and public safety services. The pressing need for better services in these areas reinforces their view.  The millage will expire after 2025, if not renewed or replaced. The replacement will probably be on the ballot in 2024. Now is the time for city policymakers to demonstrate that future tax revenues would be used for mental health and public safety services.

That was the case probably because the Drinking Water Revolving Fund Program offers not only lower than market interest rates, but the potential for loan forgiveness.  Considering those two very important factors, why is the city not planning to issue the bonds through the Drinking Water Revolving Fund program in this instance? I hope there will be some discussion of this before you vote to approve DS1, which is a notice of the city's intent to issue up to $45 million in water supply revenue bonds.

In reference to opioid use and substance use disorder, it's important for folks to understand that the language to use when relating to addiction is important. Words matter, and choosing the right language helps to decrease stigma and provide compassionate support for persons with substance use disorders and their families and the communities that support them.  Choosing the right language leads to more effective treatment and encourages persons with a substance use disorder to get the help they need, that they so need and deserve.  Michigan's opioid epidemic is complex. Understanding it requires multiple intricate and interconnected factors that have produced health inequities and made entire communities susceptible to adverse health outcomes. Reducing disparities must be a focus of programs funded with the opioid settlement funds.  Investing in evidence-based prevention, interventions, recovery supports, harm reduction efforts, and implementing criminal legal reforms to transition to a less punitive and more health-focused approach will all be key.  I am calling on the City of Ann Arbor and the surrounding communities to be a leader in reducing stigma.

My name is Carrie Nieto. I am a member of  1650 Kelvin Street. I have been there for four years. My neighbors have been there for almost 40 years. That area was a farmland many, many years ago. We love that area. We love our neighborhood. We are actually zoned Silo Township right now.  I guess one concern I have with rezoning skyscrapers in that area with no tenant parking allocated, currently there is a development being placed towards that roundabout by M14. I'm concerned with the access to those because currently there's zero access to that plot that butts up right up to M14.  except 1650 Calvin Street Road. So it'd be interesting to see what sort of traffic plans have been laid out for, I don't know how many units are going in there, hundreds? Where are they going to park? Do people expect them to park in other people's property? I think there's some major things that I would like to see. In addition to parking,  I don't know if anybody's been on that road on Maple Street, kind of heading towards M14. It's backed up almost to Jackson Road already. So we have one lane going each way. So I don't know if there's any recommendations or plans to actually widen the roads, but if somebody is expecting to put one million people into a city that has two lane roads, there's a major problem right there. So it almost appears that there's  the cart before the horse as opposed to it.  being clearly mapped out, like what is the traffic study? How many people are gonna be on the road? There is a high school, Skyline High School. There are children walking back and forth to that school, crossing two roundabouts to get to school. There are bike lanes everywhere. People are getting to classes. There's neighborhood elementary schools, Haseley, Abbott, everywhere. And you're just gonna throw a bunch of  units there and expect just everything to work itself out. I don't know, I think there's some major things I would like to see and I don't think it's just because I live at Kelvin Street. I don't want 30 story high-rises in my backyard. Indeed, I do not want that. But I would ask you, if you lived on a beautiful property,  for many years, how would you like, you know, a skyscraper when you walked out your back door to see that? I just present that to you."}, {"start": 3161.466, "end": 3165.993, "speaker": "SPEAKER_11", "text": "Thank you. Thank you.

My name is Jeff Wilkerson, and I am the developer and managing partner for the North Maple Apartment Project. I'm also the founder of A2 Collaborative, a local design development firm that is focused on innovative, forward-reaching housing solutions that incorporate various elements of sustainability, affordability, and community connectivity.  I wanted to take this opportunity to discuss the proposed PUD rezoning specific to the project and why I feel that this zoning is appropriate. The current site includes four large parcels that were previously classified as Township and R1B. Combined, these parcels total 3.13 acres, yet the current zoning only provides for three residential housing units. In consideration of the location along a major transit corridor,  in proximity to parks and community amenities, with ample access to public utilities, this is a vastly underutilized resource. The PUD zoning proposal for tonight allows the site to be utilized in a far more efficient way. Most importantly, the new zoning would allow for the addition of 79 critically needed new housing units, of which 12 of those would be allocated as affordable and provided on-site.  The building and clubhouse design maintains a modest footprint and preserves natural site features and open space. Orientation to Maple Road allows for efficient connectivity to public utilities, as well as access to public transportation. Setback proposals and landscape buffers will minimize disruption to current residents, both during and after construction. In fact, the location of the site itself offers a substantial buffer for current Ann Arbor residents.  In order to meet the future needs of the community, it is critical that we support a diversity of housing opportunities that bolster the economic and social well-being of the current and future residents. This PUD rezoning meets the sustainability objectives of the city while preserving and enhancing access to local resources that ultimately benefit all members of the Ann Arbor community.

I'd just like to address a couple of things that a previous speaker mentioned. First of all, the idea that this development is 30 stories skyscrapers, it's four stories.  which is hardly a skyscraper or a high-rise, or I'm not even sure I'd call it a mid-rise. No parking, I think it has 65 spaces.  There was a mention of hundreds of units. It's 79 units, actually. And a few things that I really like about this development are, I like the idea of the developer putting in a bus stop out in front and a crosswalk. I think that's sorely needed in that location, having another crosswalk there.  And I like that it's fully electrified, which I know we've had a lot of discussions around that as a city.

I would like to compliment the development team on this project. I've been following this since the initial pre-PUD meeting. What this developer has done is something we'd like all developers to do. They studied what the city wants, what the community has said it wants in terms of sustainability,  affordable housing, and they designed it from the start to meet what our city says it wants. They're not looking to get around the rules like some other developments do. They designed this very intentionally to meet what they studied and learned was what the city of Ann Arbor would like to see. So they deserve to be complimented.  For those who don't know, I used to develop subdivisions in Oakland County. This is what we would do. We would go to a community before we even had the land where we intended to develop. And we learned what that community would want. And we brought in proposals to meet those needs as opposed to other developers that decide what they want and try to get a city or community to bend to their will. So I really want to let council know  that you do, people are watching. Developers are watching your council meetings. You are sending a message with every vote you make. In the case of this developer, they've listened well to what our community has said at once.

I'd just like to take the next few minutes to highlight some of the major sustainability and design features of the site plan. First among those is a full commitment to all electrification. North Maple apartments will be all electric from day one and will include all electric Energy Star appliances as well as an all electric HVAC system.  Reduced on-site energy usage is key to producing low-carbon impact buildings, and early design decisions must commit to minimizing energy demand. The North Maple Apartments wall and window sections were designed to exceed current Michigan building code and include a continuous, unbroken insulation layer to minimize thermal bridging. Furthermore, the building's triple-pane windows underwent extensive performance analysis to ensure maximum effectiveness in air infiltration,  water penetration, and structural wind load testing. The incorporation of photovoltaic technology will allow for the onsite production of 147 megawatts of electricity annually via a 112 kilowatt rooftop solar array. Our energy modeling projects that these panels should offset as much as 15% of the building's anticipated annual energy usage.  The geothermal design for the project has undergone engineering review, and in coordination with an optimized thermal envelope, would make use of 19 500-foot borings located primarily in the courtyard that would provide all of the required heating and cooling needs for the building on an annual basis. The system would be zoned such that it would, in the event of one of these zones being disabled for maintenance or any other reason,  the entirety of the system could still effectively deliver heating and cooling aids to the building's residents. The North Maple site plan was also designed to promote non-vehicular usage, including the pedestrian crosswalk on North Maple that connects directly to Garden Homes Park, and a newly proposed sidewalk on the west side of Maple would fill a much needed gap between Maple Cove and the M14 interchange.  On-site amenities allow for ease of bike storage and maintenance for future residents, as well as public transportation infrastructure via a covered bus stop. We are proud of the design and sustainability elements included in this project, and it's my hope that council will offer its support for this project.

So if each unit, I mean, the math doesn't add up. Where are these cars going to go? It's not fully fleshed out. I think it's a great idea to put people in Ann Arbor, but if there's no way for them to get to where they need to go or park, nobody's going to be riding a bike in the winter. I mean, let's be real.

One thing I wanted to comment on in particular was the first resolved clause that calls on the Michigan Public Services Commission to pass legislation to eliminate or lift the 1% distributed generation cap to increase energy reliability and capacity. Why is this important?  Well, according to a March 3rd report in the Detroit News, DTE Energy is predicting that they're going to reach this 1% milestone this July. And that means that they're going to be able to cut the rate that they pay for home solar that goes back into the grid to customers who have installed the panels. They're allowed to do this. They're allowed to cap their participation in distributed generation. And that amount is 1% right now of average peak load.  The impact that this has, it makes it harder for people to pay off their home solar system. It hurts businesses that are doing solar installation. All of the things that we want to encourage, it basically disincentivizes. Ironically enough, DTE's filing on this matter came six days before the ice storm that knocked out power to hundreds of thousands of DTE customers. Something that, by the way, residents that had solar with a battery backup were actually able to bear.  And so what they're basically proposing right now, they pay between $0.09 and $0.15 per kilowatt hour when you give energy back into the grid. And they're proposing that once this limit is reached, they pay $0.03 to $0.04 per kilowatt hour. So in other words, a quarter of what they are paying right now. The 1% number is arbitrary, it goes against our goals, and it needs to go away. So let's see a fair system for paying folks for the excess energy that they are generating.

It's hard to figure out what services are available for people who are in crisis. And at the bare minimum, to have a statement to DTE and say,  Not only has this impacted our city budget, it impacts social service agencies, it impacts individuals, it impacts families who are coming out of a pandemic, and these extra costs really, really hurt families.

I'm happy to be bringing this resolution forward from the Environmental Commission, and I wanted to say a few words about why supporting pollinator habitat is so important. Bees and other pollinators touch our lives every day in ways that we probably don't realize or we take for granted. For example, they're responsible for as much as a third of the food that we consume. So a world without them is one in which we have fewer food choices, and the ones that we have have less nutrition.  Pollinator populations are in decline around the world due to habitat loss, alteration, fragmentation, as well as pesticides. The state of Michigan alone has seen a 61% drop in its bee population over the span of 15 years. So this is really important that we all act in ways that we can to protect pollinators.  The Environmental Commission passed this resolution at their last meeting, which was just, I think, a week ago. This is an evolution of something that I think probably everyone remembers from last year, which was No Mo May, that they passed for 2022. I know that a lot of my neighbors participated in this and got excited about it. It allowed emergence and maturation of pollinators that overwinter in our yards.  We did learn some things from that effort namely that depending on the rain We probably don't need to literally stop mowing our lawn for the entire month There were some quite quite long lawns out there But also, you know, we learned that there was a lot of resident interest and so the Environmental Commission was looking at this and trying to think of a way to  you know, a monoculture of turf grass that's really long isn't ultimately what we're going for. It's a start. But I think concentrating on what we can do year-round and the practices that will actually create habitats that are amenable to pollinators was really the focus of what you see in front of you. So encouraging residents to reduce mowing, especially in the spring, reducing leaf cleanup, as well as, you know, having diverse native plantings.  So in other words, consider alternatives to turf grass. So you'll notice that this resolution talks about a communication plan. I think the Environmental Commission is eager to work with staff on different seasonal campaigns, such as a spring, emphasizing the mowing frequency. I did want to note that everything that is in here complies with our current ordinances. So there's nothing that has to be an exception. I think the limit is 12 inches for grass. So I guess that's it."}, {"start": 4951.602, "end": 5087.528, "speaker": "SPEAKER_11", "text": "Further discussion? All in favor? Opposed? It is approved.

Some of the  tree falls of course and limbs were where city trees owned by the city on the right away but there are also limb and tree falls throughout residents properties without regard to whether the trees were city trees or are the personal property of property owners the city is excited to help residents throughout the community  in cleaning up these tree branches. And so we have offered this free and follow-on service to residents to pick up street trees throughout the community. It of course costs a fair bit of coin because we are requiring, you know,  contracting folks who are not presently city employees to pick up hundreds of tons of trees that we were not anticipating that were not in our prior work plan. This is a service that I know we are rolling out. We are rolling out to be responsive to a  unforeseen community need. And we are also observing that this is something which has happened and I suspect will happen in the future.

The site location abuts an off-ramp for N14 and an existing double-lane urban roundabout, and it lies on Maple Road, a major transit corridor that's well-served by buses.  The site plan proposes a four-story, 79-unit apartment building and a single-story clubhouse. There's going to be a mix of 15 studios, 48 one-bedroom apartments, and 16 two-bedroom apartments. So that's nice diversity within the project.  As for sustainability, we've heard a lot about that. But I will just assure you that the PUD regulations stipulate. So this is what the zoning calls for. And even if this project were not to happen for some reason, which I have no reason to think that it would not, this is what this parcel will be zoned for.  It stipulates the development will be all electric, equipped with solar panels and batteries to offset 15% of its annual energy use. It will be insulated above building code requirements to minimize heat loss and maximize the panel's effectiveness. The developer described the design of the geothermal heating. That was nice. It will also be equipped with high efficiency LED lighting, Energy Star appliances, and operable triple pane windows, which is great.  The project supports alternative transportation, as we've spoken. There will be 65 parking spaces off street for 79 units. And the idea here isn't to make people get rid of all their cars, but let's make it easier step by step for people to drive less. And one great step is to take the bus to work.  and back. The project is well situated to facilitate such a step. So we've heard about affordability. The developer is required to provide 15% permanently affordable housing units on site. That would be 12 units total, or by payment in lieu. And there's a formula.  That that is used to say exactly what that would mean. We will also see additional required public Benefits such as a refuge island to be provided in North make Maple Road, which is wide preservation of wetlands stormwater management and a $51,000 contribution to the parks fund Further discussion councilor song So"}, {"start": 5401.38, "end": 5549.103, "speaker": "SPEAKER_17", "text": "If you take a look a bit farther down Maple Road at Hickory Way Apartments, you'll note that it's about a similar size, three stories, similar size of 84 units.

Looking back through Legistar, we did a rezoning for the parcel by Hickory Way.  the South Maple Apartments. We, meaning City Council, back in 2017, Avalon was able to get tax credits from MSHDA in 2018. And only just last year, we had a groundbreaking for the second phase of the development project, right? So if we're looking at the timeline from 2017 to 2022 to get to a point where we have around 70 units,  That's a long timeline. And now we have a project in front of us that not only helps us maybe tighten that timeline a little bit, but add to our much needed housing stock for a community at 60% AMI. And for folks who aren't following, that's about $60,000 a year for a four-person household in Ann Arbor. $100,000 a year is the average AMI. This is needed housing. It meets.  It meets needs along a transit corridor so that we won't be contributing to more traffic, more commuter traffic. And it's nearby a high school, a popular high school. We approved a development by Pioneer High School not too long ago, a much larger development across from Pioneer. So I think this work is in line with what we've been doing for at least the past five years, well before many of us were on council.  As far as I know the Hickory Way apartments and Avalon housing has not been disruptive to community members And I hope the conversation changes from I was here first and I get to decide who my neighbors are to I Welcome more neighbors because I want others to experience the same benefits and that our neighbor Incoming neighbors are here for the exact same reasons that folks are here for school work  I hope that we have a nice welcome wagon for them at this opening.
