I live at 2340 Georgetown, and I am the current president of the Orchard Hills Maplewood Homeowners Association, a neighborhood bordering the Plymouth Road corridor.  I agree there is value in public transportation along major corridors. I understand that public transportation must be subsidized. I would support transportation nodes with mixed use if paired with a better transit system. I might support increasing density along corridors with existing transportation.  If the regulations were written to respect certain characteristics of those corridors, which TC1 does not do. I don't think one size fits all. Plymouth Road is not at all like State and Eisenhower, which had no natural features and no residential neighbors. Plymouth Corridor residents already live in a 15 to 20 minute walkable neighborhood. I think significant natural features, trees, wetlands, creek sheds like the Miller Creek are too valuable to our health  and well-being to be replaced. Traffic and pedestrian safety is vitally important, yet there's no plan to address this yet. Heights of TC1 buildings should not shade the backyards of adjacent residential lots.  I know Council has a vision for the future, but most Ann Arborites don't know that yet. I expect that could change during the public engagement portion of the rewrite of the comprehensive plan. What I don't understand is what made this resolution necessary. What is the urgency of this? What steps are considered extraneous? Does this mean you want to rezone these two corridors without any further public engagement?  What is the reason for outlawing any improvements in the ordinance before passing more mass zonings with what we know is a flawed ordinance? This resolution seems urgent, vague, and perhaps misleading. It sends a message that seems to say  We need to pass this before the comprehensive plan gets going and the public have a chance to alter it. Something is wrong here. I don't expect Council to always agree with me or any other resident. However, I respect, I expect respect, an opportunity for dialogue and an effective effort for addressing residents' concerns.  This resolution signals not caring to know what the public thinks because you have a vision and you fear it might fail if you inform the public. If your vision is right, let the voices of the public incorporate their ideas. You will convince them. After all, we, the public, are the stakeholders here.

He is the Council for the EDC, and he's gonna talk about the origins and purposes of the EDC.  I would like to speak as a member of the board about the exciting possibilities of different activities of the EDC to support the economic development of the city of Ann Arbor. The EDC's primary role to date has been to issue tax-exempt private activity revenue bonds for various projects in the city.  The EDC has not issued any of these bonds in a number of years due to low interest rates. This MOU will allow for the EDC to work closely with the city administrator to determine other activities and services that the EDC will provide.  The EDC is also aware of the comprehensive economic development services provided by Ann Arbor SPARK to the city. And the MOU provides that the activities and services to be developed by the EDC with the city administrator will be outside of the scope of the agreements between Ann Arbor SPARK and the city of Ann Arbor and will not interfere with the Ann Arbor SPARK services.  In sum, I hope the City Council approves this MOU to allow the EDC and the City Administrator to begin to determine the additional services and activities the EDC will provide, which will enhance the economic development of the City of Ann Arbor and improve the lives of its citizens.

I'd just like to touch on a technical point here, backing up Professor Thompson's comments. The EDC is a separate entity from the city. A bond issued by the EDC is not a bond issued by the  By the city and vice versa. It's important to keep that distinction in mind The EDC is a is a way to for a eligible applicant for an eligible project to save Substantial sums on their financing costs. So it's it's been it's benefited many projects in the city over the years but as a bond issuing entity  it's required to comply with the requirements of both state and federal law.  Federal law is governing tax exempt obligations like EDC bonds. It's probably one of the, if not the, one of the most complex in the tax code. Arbitrage regulations and so forth. So that it's important that as a project goes forward that everything that can be done is being done to facilitate that process. One of the reasons, one of the,  underlying the MOU besides the ones that Professor Thompson mentioned, was to make very clear the paramount necessity that these bonds, no matter what these new enterprises are going to be, the new services and roles that the EDC may play for the city,  that underline all of it, there has to be compliance with these laws. So for that technical reason, that's, again, the other reason. The other, as she pointed out, was the tremendous opportunities for the city and the staff and  the board of the EDC to explore what these new roles and services may be. It's literally unlimited. So it should be exciting to see. So I, by all means, please regard the EDC as a partner and an entity looking very much forward to working with council and staff. I'll be here.

This is Tom Stolver calling from Lower Town in Ann Arbor. First, I'd like to give my regards to Bob White and his years of volunteer service. He and I served on the Historic District Commission together for six years.  As someone who's developed in multiple communities and personally rezoned properties and participated in multiple comprehensive plan revision processes and has access to advice from experts in land use law, I offer this. Zoning is law, literally. The zoning code is the codification of the comprehensive plan into enforceable legal language. A rezoning is a change in the law, literally.  So do we really want to instruct the Planning Commission to recommend to change the law for hundreds of parcels to a one-size-fits-all set of rules called TC1, without them being able to recommend to make a new TC2 if good planning would suggest a different set of rules, and without being able to tweak TC1 if it would be problematic planning to apply it as-is to multiple transit corridors, each with different characteristics?  I don't think that is a wise direction, nor do I think it meets the intent of the Michigan Zoning Enabling Act. The Michigan Zoning Enabling Act allows municipalities to have a zoning ordinance if it was based on a plan, a comprehensive plan. They go hand in hand, and the planning comes first. You make the plan, then the zoning language is the legally enforceable language to allow the plan to be executed. Yes, our comprehensive plan mentions the broad concept of transit-oriented zoning multiple times.  So transit-oriented development is consistent with the plan, but the plan lacks sufficient specificity to go straight into encoding. But that's what we're doing. An analogy would be in software development, where if you take high-level design and go straight into coding it, you end up with a mess that has to be reworked.  This proposed resolution presupposes that the Planning Commission may not determine that a new transit corridor zoning category, say TC2, be created if it would better fit the Plymouth and Washtenaw Corridors' unique characteristics. The resolution says that the TC1 set of rules must be applied. And it goes further than that. It says we must rezone hundreds of parcels to TC1 as a priority prior to making any modifications to TC1.  If TC1 doesn't fit the new corridor as well, or if we find other fixes are needed to TC1 as we learn more how applicants with properties in the first two iterations are dealing with it. We are to ignore all of that. And we must rush full steam ahead, rezoning hundreds of parcels to a flawed, one-size-fits-all set of rules. We sure are in a hurry to make amends, just prior to the comprehensive plan revision started, where there will be more public engagement  and a more robust planning process.

I have studied public health and work in public health at the university, and I rent in Ann Arbor. And I'm calling in support of the Coalition for Re-envisioning Our Safety, or CROWS. And I do want to express my gratitude for the recently released Community Engagement Report that was provided by Public Sector Consultants, PSCs.  I am particularly pleased to see that three key findings in the report align with Crow's values and I urge the City Council to prioritize the following. So first, funding unarmed public safety response.  from existing budget resources. And this approach really ensures that fiscal responsibility and demonstrates the city's commitment to addressing the root causes of conflict and crisis without increasing the tax burden on residents and redirecting funds from traditional law enforcement to unarmed public safety response and redirect city resources to supportive social services instead of punitive and harmful law enforcement.  This prevention rather than punishment approach to public safety can reduce the need for more costly interventions later on. The second aspect is establishing a separate number for unarmed response. And having a dedicated number for unarmed response can help streamline services, ensure appropriate response to non-emergency situations.  and alleviate the burden on the 911 system. By establishing a separate number for unarmed response, communities can ensure that mental health crises, substance abuse issues, and other nonviolent situations are addressed with the appropriate level of care and expertise. The last component is excluding police from unarmed response. And by focusing on unarmed response professionals for nonviolent situations, we can  reduce the risk of unnecessary use of force, we can enhance community trust, and encourage more effective community-based solutions. And excluding police from unarmed responses can help minimize the potential for violence or use of force. Unarmed crisis response teams comprised of mental health professionals, social workers, or community mediators, they can often handle situations  without resorting to forceful tactics. So I kind of request that the city council take these findings into consideration and move forward with releasing the RFC for unarmed response.

Would it make any difference to Ms. Ghazi here, who is on this Human Rights Commission? Would this murder of a two-year-old make any difference?  Would it make them say no military aid to Israel?

It appears that historical revisionism never rests. After distributing my address to council on April 17 to a wider audience via email and Facebook, I received a reply from Diane King of Texas. She was going to disseminate my address to her email list and cautioned me against using the word Nazi, claiming it a derogatory term.  She wrote, we abhor this term. The Germans never referred to themselves that way. It's equivalent to the other ethnic slurs that are verboten, but it's okay to disparage Germans. I already knew that the term Nazi originated from a country bumpkin reference to Germans, a slur based on the common farm boy or simpleton name, Ignaz, and the shortening of that name to Nazi.  This knowledge was supplied by Benton Bradbury's book, The Myth of German Villainy. But I did not know that national socialists never referred to themselves by that name. In my ignorance, I thought everyone used the term. I asked myself whether Diane could be correct and asked the Facebook public for evidence to counter her claim.  I wanted to be shown a reference by a German National Socialist who used the term Nazi in a correspondence or speech. I ask anyone here if they have corroborative evidence of National Socialists describing themselves as Nazis.  No one on Facebook supplied such information. One respondent, though, alerted me to an article that explained exactly what Diane was claiming. The article reports that a powerful Jewish journalist named Conrad Hayden popularized this term in the 1920s as an epithet  meant to degrade members of the National Socialist Workers' Party of Germany. Apparently, this name-calling stuck. We are left with the impression that everyone used the term because we, mistakenly, are continuing to use it.  Two takeaways. One, people in groups should be referred to as they deem fit. How would our black community react to being referred to by the N word? How would our Jewish community appreciate being called the K word? I doubt either group would appreciate it. It wouldn't be right.  Second takeaway, perhaps the successful name calling technique was yet another reason why German Jews were found in disfavor by their countrymen.

The Commons is removed from the entirety of the Central Park and Civic Center Commons.  in the resolutions and work that the Council of the Commons has put forward, they have eliminated that sense. The central idea of this, that the Commons is commonly pooled resources self-managed by the users.  This is what was demonstrated to the effect of the Nobel Prize in economics as the most effective way of organizing commonly poor resources. More effective than having the government, more effective than having a private profit corporation when the users  manage the resources, they are better managed, more productively, and more happily. And besides just taking out that idea, they also have reduced the notion to a plaza, not a Central Park, and the entirety of the idea of a civic center is removed, a ceremonial meeting place, a visitor center for people coming to Ann Arbor.

But that's certainly something that I understand the concern.  a grant that was made to the city of Ann Arbor, but that was sort of our rationale in that regard. We recognize, too, in regards to your question about who is our population, there really isn't a standard definition for  a micro-business, a small business, a low-level entrepreneur. And so one of the, I think, two main agenda items for our kickoff meeting once this gets launched, which will be held in collaboration with community partners who both were named in the proposal, but also others who we've talked to subsequently, is to really kind of come up with a working definition for who  who are the folks that we want to reach out to, but again, we want to do that in collaboration with the folks who know the best, and so that we're not imposing a definition that's not going to work. You'd also asked about  the sample size. So the addendum to the proposal talked about a group of 25 individuals. Those are folks who we'll do qualitative interviews with. The sample itself is 100 members who get the guaranteed income payment, 100 who serve as the control group. The addendum was just to add in an additional  And I also thank you for pointing out an error in our proposal around issues of attrition and retention.

Councilmember Watson, you'd asked about Friends Indeed who are indeed based in Ypsilanti.  They do serve the larger Washtenaw County. We don't also view them as sort of the sole source of recruitment. We don't really view any organization that we would work with as the place where we're going to recruit all of our participants. We plan to cast a wide net. And we ourselves plan to do a lot of just feet on the ground and going to events and not placing the burden entirely on the nonprofit sector to do the recruiting.  into the program. We see them as both being very helpful and being able to, you know, help us, you know, with things like providing feedback on our surveys, feedback on reports, things like this. You'd also asked about, like, well, why not just give a, you know, one-time upfront cash infusion.  We didn't want to necessarily say, because the spirit of guaranteed income really is, there aren't strings attached to what you do with the money. We didn't want to say, oh, here's some money to invest in your business. That's a slightly different model. So we're talking amongst our team. And something that we'd want to talk with the community about is, do we do  Monthly payments that are of the same amount, do we front load the payments and taper off things like that? But those are some of the design decisions that we're considering right now.  And then Council Member Harrison, you'd asked a number of questions. One about how we decided about our potential collaborators, and whether we put out a call for support. We lacked time to do that with the turnaround time in getting the proposal in. So we did a snowball approach to people suggesting us, you should talk to this group, or you should talk to this group, as well as drawing upon our own community connections.  And again, the focus of our outreach effort at that point was really to identify a population to work with, not necessarily a partner. So once we sort of landed on a population, then we selected to name Friends Indeed as our community partner because of just all the work that they do with their Circles program in this area.  You named a number of different very important organizations in the community. We have reached out or will reach out to most of them. The RFP, as we read it, specified one partner to be named. But I've been in pretty regular, almost weekly, communications with the Ann Arbor Community Foundation, for example, about bringing them into the mix.  We've talked to other organizations as well and envision continuing to do that.  You also noted in the addendum, there was a shift in the budget where the payment amount went down slightly. In consultation with the team here at the city, we decided to add an additional round of qualitative interviews to help better inform the design of the study going forward.  And but keeping the total amount of money the same. So the cost of administering the payments, and we are going to contract with a third party to send out the payments, that's fixed. And we are pretty bare bones in terms of our staff effort. And that's along with the university contributing about $170,000.  in costs as well. So we took the payments down, as you know, about $2. So that was done to really bolster the research. While we very much would love it if every person in the pilot participated in every phase of the research,  You know, that is up to the individual. We would not force anybody to complete a survey or an interview, and their payments aren't, their guaranteed income payments aren't contingent upon that. We would not disenroll anybody if they missed a survey. That's, you know, that would not be within the spirit of the program.  You'd also asked about the role that Circles and Friends, indeed, could play in helping us to locate potential participants. The Circles program really does have, as its model, the goal of helping  folks who are lower income start their own businesses and that really does resonate with what we're proposing. They've been running their Circles program that does this for about five years and they're currently in their sixth cohort.  They're definitely a group that we want to be able to tap into their network, but we also are going to collaborate with just a wide variety of stakeholders and service providers within the community, and particularly groups that, you know,  would help us locate folks who are not necessarily going to be easy for a U of M researcher to reach out to. I mean, we really are committed to developing relationships with trusted members of different communities in order to help bridge some of that gap and really to help the success of the project as a whole.  And that would include organizations that work with folks who have justice system involvement. And I appreciate that you raised that group up. For that group, certainly this kind of entrepreneurial activity is really important if folks are locked out of labor market activities otherwise. So Poverty Solutions is just starting a collaboration project with A Brighter Way.  Trevor, my colleague, is on the Housing Subcommittee of Washtenaw County Reentry Stakeholders Initiative. So we have some connections to get us started on the pilot. Another really important piece to this whole pilot is making sure that people are not worse off  for participating in it, meaning that they don't lose benefits they're receiving. So the good news is we've been in conversations with the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, and we're in the process of submitting an application for a waiver to make sure that SNAP, Medicaid, TANF, and a couple other benefit programs, that the guaranteed income payment won't count toward their eligibility for those programs.  And we're starting conversations to make sure that that would also be the case with any housing assistance folks would get. So we are trying to make sure that no one is worse off for that. And we want to also, you know,  So we'll make sure that we really have conversations about that, because that is one of the most important aspects of communication around the Guaranteed Income Project. It also could be, of course, that folks may be reluctant to come forward, not just because of fear of losing benefits, but also of tax implications or other fears about, like, is this information going to get out?  to third parties who could use it against them. So going through our institutional review board process certainly provides a layer of protection of confidentiality. We also just started talking about, and I believe we are going to go forward with securing a certificate of confidentiality from the federal government through NIH.  and that will protect the privacy of folks in the research study. It prohibits us from disclosing information about them except under a really, really limited set of circumstances. And again, we would try to convey that to participants so that they know we take their confidentiality really, really seriously. Finally, I would just say,  Thinking about, again, getting back to sort of the who and the why of this proposal that we put together. Again, we don't want to mandate that anyone use the guaranteed income payment for any particular purpose. If they want to use it toward their business, terrific. If not, that's great too. That said,  Nearly all, if not all of the other guaranteed income pilots operating throughout the nation, focus on a particular population. So I have a long list, and I can share it with you, but that includes fathers in parenting programs, female identifying care professionals, working adults, people enrolled in a community college program. So we're sort of using the low-level entrepreneur framework as a way to,  kind of select into including who's the group that will get the payment. But there's no stipulation that anyone has to keep working or on their side business in order to continue receiving the payment at all. So I sped through that really quickly.

We've used survey questions before about, do you do any of these things? Do you cut hair? Do you bake cakes?  And we were talking in our last team meeting about, let's maybe come up with as exhaustive of a list as possible of activities that people might do, rather than saying, oh, what's your side job? So allowing people to check off, here are some things that I'm doing.  You know, we also, you know, I think we can't stress enough to potential participants, you know, that benefits won't be affected. You know, and that's communicating that will be really key. And if we, you know, with the certificate of confidentiality, that protects us from MDHHS saying, like, no, you need to tell us who's in your study and how much money they are,  getting on the side. That's what the certificate does. And another discussion we've had too internally is getting some legal counsel from some of our colleagues at the law school about what are some other ways we can  we can make sure that we're affording folks the most protection as possible because, yeah, the last thing we want to do is have people be penalized for activities they're doing because that's, you know, that's what they need to do to keep their families afloat. And Trevor, do you want to add on to that?"}], "public_hearings_1": [], "public_hearings_2": []}
