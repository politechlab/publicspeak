Chair Carter, you have the call."}, {"start": 400, "end": 745, "speaker": "SPEAKER_32", "text": "Good evening, Mr. Mayor, members of council, Madam Clerk. My name is Stephanie Carter. I am the chair of the Ann Arbor Independent Community Oversight Police Oversight Commission. Seven years ago, to the day,  July 6th, 2016, Philando Castile was shot and killed as a result of a traffic stop. It was reported that the stop was because of a cracked taillight. It's also been reported that perhaps the stop was because of tinted windows.  I don't believe in coincidence and so I don't believe that it is on that anniversary that we are here to consider the driving equity ordinance. Nor do I think it is coincidental that this ordinance comes before you on the second reading at pretty much the same time that the EMU SMART traffic study came out.  Now, let me talk for just a second about that traffic study. As I have said before when I came before you, ICPAC plans to have a public forum at our next meeting, which will be September 26th.  that the location will be announced. We are inviting council, we're inviting all the police department, we're inviting the public, and we hope that everyone comes out, anyone who has an interest in discussing, whether it's criticizing or whatever, with regard to this report, we're interested in public input.  And then we expect that IGPAC will be discussing some of the recommendations in that traffic study. But let me just point to a couple of the conclusions from that traffic study.  They say our analysis conclusively identified significant disparities across every dimension examined with non-white motorists being stopped and searched more frequently and white motorists being stopped and searched less frequently than would be expected in every instance.  Some of the largest disparities identified in this analysis involve African American male drivers for stops initiated for equipment violations. Exactly what the ordinance addresses.  I also want to read a quote. This is a quote that the study quotes from a larger nationwide study that was done in 2020. In a related but larger scale national study analyzing traffic stop disparities, these, Pearson is the name of the examiner.  conclude that, quote, the downstream effect of traffic stops can be injurious, even if individual stop decisions are not directly affected by the color of one's skin. Similarly, enforcement of minor traffic violations, like broken taillights, even if conducted uniformly and without animus, can place heavy burdens on black and Hispanic drivers  without improving public safety. Ann Arbor is about to be on the forefront of what I think is gonna be a national movement. And across the country, folks like us are looking at doing away with what really produces unnecessary  between the police and the public. Totally unnecessary. You know, if any of you drive and you drive out of state in places where they have toll roads, you don't often see somebody sitting in those toll booths anymore collecting the toll. They take a picture of your car and then they send you your bill. This ordinance provides for that type of enforcement if it's needed for minor traffic violations.  And so, without sacrificing the public safety of those of us who live in the city of Ann Arbor and those who work in the city of Ann Arbor and come from other places, I urge you to adopt the Driving Equity Ordinance. As I say, the ICPAC plans  Once again, I can't emphasize this enough because sometimes you put something out there and you hope that people respond to it. And we're hoping that council and the public will respond by coming out September 26. We will announce a location. It probably will not be here in City Hall. And we'd like to discuss this. We'd like to have a public forum. But hopefully by that time, the driving equity ordinance will already be adopted.

Myself and many members of our association have attended all the community meetings regarding the Earhart Road 2023 project since 2019. I have spoken and written to you about this project now for over a year. We have wanted to see production and resurfacing for many years.  Our goal was to eliminate the sidewalk gap project because it would not serve its desired purpose and still won't because significant gaps remain in front of Boxford Cemetery and between the Pine Tree Street with no plans to fill those gaps. Also, because it would infringe upon and significantly harm our property and likely seriously damage our mature trees and paintings and plantings.  We were very disappointed that it took numerous attempts to be heard by the city. We attended meetings, we made public comments, we wrote letters, but there was no response from our representative government. Our own Ward 2 council members were told not to speak with us. It was not until we hired an attorney to force a response and provide a signed petition  that we finally received some response. We should not have had to pay thousands of dollars to force a representative government to respond and to work with us. Ultimately, Nick Hutchinson and Nick Bailey did meet and collaborate with us. They listened to our concerns especially and seriously. They investigated our suggestions to move the project west or closer to the median, which may waste the sidewalk to be closer to the existing growth.  They changed the retaining wall design and configuration to limit the damage to our property, and agreed to replace, like for like, evergreen for evergreen, for any tree that needed to be removed to accommodate their design. We do still have concerns about potential traffic issues during the construction phase.  But we would like this evening to thank Nick Bailey and Nick Hutchinson for their collaboration, and we look forward to our continuing project partnership during the construction and reforestation phase of the project.

This city council has stood so fiercely against any Palestinian human rights resolution for so many years.  Think about it. Think about it. A lot of these people look very much like Palestinians. If they're going to treat Palestinians that way, how do you think they're going to treat you? How do you think they're going to treat you?  If they think Palestinians are so disposable, we've been in here 21 straight years, demanding a simple human rights resolution against the apartheid state of Israel, and this city council has thrown every obstacle in our way.

Ayer has taken campaign money from old friends of the Israel Defense Forces,  Just this week, you saw the Israel Defense Forces shooting helicopter gunships into an over-packed refugee camp of Palestinians. This is the kind of racist bastard of a city council that we're faced with. Again, if they think Palestinians are so disposable, so murderable,  What do you think they think about you? What do you think they think about you? Unfortunately, whenever we bring up Palestinian human rights, the city council gets up on their chair and screams about the Holocaust in Europe, which happened. It ended in 1945.  And this council uses the Holocaust as a weapon against the Palestinian people to help Israel kill more Palestinians. Whenever we mention Palestinian human rights, they jump up on their chair and scream anti-Semitism as a weapon against the Palestinian people.  Even Watson and Song were practically crying like a baby over the sufferings of the Holocaust. Well, God damn it, it ended almost 80 years ago. Think about what you're doing now.

I'm here again because I am going to run a campaign and replace this lady, Jen Eyre, who is racist and she has accepted money from friends of Israel Defense Forces. Israel Defense Forces are a terrorist organization that murder children, elderly, anyone they can get their hands on.  Israel has done everything, everything under the sun. Murdered toddlers, killed reporters, uprooted people from their homes. And the United States pays for these atrocities by spending billions of dollars each year from our taxes.  We've been asking for 20 years that this body of people discuss we are against military aid to Israel. They never have. I don't know what else Israel has to do for this bunch of white people to decide it is enough.  A two-year-old was killed on the same day that Ms. Song here and Mr. Watson here were crying over how much they love Israel and their friends and this and that. At the same time that Israel had murdered a two-year-old, they were saying stuff to bring us images of people in concentration camps.  People who stand against Israel and say no more murder of Palestinians are not for murder of other people. In fact, we stand against all of that, have spoken against all of that all of our lives.

Consider $97 trillion that you white people, all blacks,  You know why you owe them? Because you extracted free labor from them hundreds of years and you piled it up and you became the rich people that you are today. Without them and without the land that you stole from red people, from native people, you would not be sitting where you're sitting.  Start thinking about giving it back, and it's 97 trillion. Did you hear me, Mr. Mayor? It's $97 trillion that you white people owe black people. Start doing it, and stop squeezing black people out of this town. Your policies have made this town more segregated than ever before. You are racist against blacks, and you are racist against Palestinians.  And this country cannot stand that anymore.

At the core of this resolution is the belief that all citizens, regardless of their past, deserve an opportunity to rebuild their lives and fully reintegrate into society. The mission is to break the cycle of recidivism, reduce social inequality, and address the systemic issues that often lead individuals into the criminal legal system in the first place.  Many tenant-based voucher holders have had interactions with the criminal legal system. The trauma associated with these experiences often presents significant obstacles to social reintegration, employment, and housing stability. By providing trauma-informed supportive services, we can address these barriers and help affected individuals begin their journey towards recovery and stability.  The marijuana excise tax revenue offers a substantial resource that can directly benefit these individuals. As many of you know, the legal marijuana industry was born out of a recognition that criminal penalties for marijuana usage disproportionately affected certain communities, contributing to cycles of poverty, crime, and disenfranchisement.  Thus, it's both fitting and redemptive that the financial gains from this industry are used to help heal the wounds inflicted by the very system it represents a departure from. This is not merely an investment in those impacted by the criminal legal system, but an investment in our communities, our shared values, and our collective future.  We believe in second chances, in the potential for change, and in the power of supportive services to heal and restore.

Another $250,000 for eviction prevention, which I mentioned in my earlier comments. $325,000 for building out community space and purchasing furnishings for the 121 East Catherine project.

So I was really happy to see this on our agenda this week. I feel like discussion has been floating around about this coming and other resolutions that we've passed. This is going to really advance our efforts to build out multimodal transportation, including building out connections that extend an all-ages, all-abilities bike network, improve the safety of people riding, biking, and walking,  well as supporting the long-range plans of our bus system and You know one thing I wanted to mention is that the proposal that's in front of us is really rooted in our comprehensive transportation plan It focuses on how we can make street improvements create like a low-stress bike network as I mentioned look at shared street possibilities and pedestrian malls and update signals for the safety of people biking and walking and  It also identifies a couple of key areas that are in need of rethinking in order to support safe, active transportation. One is restoring 5th Street to a two-way road, and then assessing the reconfiguration of the really complex intersection at Beaks, Broadway, Detroit, Division, and Cary. Just the fact that I have to name that many streets that come together can tell you how scary it can be to ride through that section of town.  So, because I think our transportation goals are so important, I'm proposing an amendment that has three whereas clauses. I sent it earlier, so I think that that should arrive in your inboxes. This is to immediately follow, I think, the second whereas clause. And I will go ahead and read them.  Whereas, one of the two critical goals of the Moving Together Towards Vision Zero plan is to eliminate fatalities and serious injuries resulting from traffic crashes by 2025. Whereas, one of two critical goals of the Moving Together Towards Vision Zero plan is to transition to a carbon-neutral transportation system by 2030.  And whereas both the Moving Together Toward Vision Zero Plan and the A20 Carbon Neutrality Plan call for a 50% reduction in vehicle miles traveled, which will require the city to reduce or eliminate the focus on congestion mitigation and sufficiency of parking, and instead assess prioritization of access for sustainable transportation modes."}, {"start": 2926, "end": 2936, "speaker": "SPEAKER_19", "text": "Is there a second?

These are things the community has to have. It's not 10% black admissions at the University of Michigan. It's one thing. And I hope the community feels confident enough to come in here and get another victory demanding reparations on a big enough scale  to make up for what's been stolen from the community, which is actually $97 trillion, according to a book by Jason Hickel called The Divide.  I hope the community will build on this thing that's being passed tonight and demand a drastic expansion of the Neutral Zones program called Future Corps, which doesn't just prepare students for college, it gets students into college, pays for their college, and furthermore, it gets them actually into jobs, not just job training.  And this program, Future Corps, should be drastically expanded. And that's not all. This city council has a lot of relationships with the University of Michigan. This city council can force the University of Michigan to keep its promise of 10% black admissions.  These are all things the community can demand. And don't be frightened by the Supreme Court ruling. There's still a window in that ruling. There's a window in that ruling that says your experiences dealing with racism, confronting racism, overcoming racism, those experiences can be taken into account for college admissions. They can be taken into account for college admissions. So you have the power. You have the power.  You have the power to push the city council for real reparations, massive reparations. You have the power to push the city council for a massive expansion of the future core program under city supervision to get every child all the way through college, all the way through college and into a good job.  You have the power to push the city council to force University of Michigan to keep its promise of 10% black admissions. There is quite a lot you have the power to do.

The Black Lives Matter mural, as you know, was desecrated. And I called the police. Why? Because it was a crime, right? Felony, actually. And I had one of my Caucasian sisters there with me.  And I was visibly upset because for me, it's more than just yellow paint on the ground. It's more than just words on the ground. They're expressions that we all need to be reminded of the value in black lives. Your officer, noticing me visibly upset, walked right past me to my Caucasian sister. And she said to him,  I didn't call you. Well, no, that's not true, because she did call after I called. But she said, this is the individual that reached out to you all first. And he came back and he had the most arrogant, nasty attitude of someone that is dealing with the public and someone that is upset, right? It was very disturbing to me.  At that point, it was more than just the mural being desecrated. Now it's the way that your police officers are handling black folks, showing that they do have bias. So when you vote on this today, I want you to understand that this is not a problem that's over there. The problem of bias rests right here in the city of Ann Arbor with your officers. And to take it a step further, I asked to speak to a supervisor who never showed up.  I asked to have the chief call me, never called. And you don't have a problem with bias here? No, we do. And so while, yes, we are grateful and we got some thumbs up of people that are going to pass this tonight, there's always more work to do. And this is not to come in and say that what you did was bad, but it's always got to lean more into the work. And understand, lastly, that unless this has more meat  As far as enforcement is concerned, we're going to be dealing with what the county is dealing with right now. Because in the county, on day one, our prosecutor passed, no pretext stops. But guess what? They're still happening.  They are still happening and their officers are not being reprimanded for making these stops. I am asking that you all make an amendment tonight to put in that these officers must follow this ordinance. This isn't a resolution. This isn't a suggestion. This is an ordinance that needs just a little more meat so that we can hold these officers accountable if they continue to do pretext stops. Thank you.

And we have that in Ann Arbor.  We pay these cops 30 million a year. It's the top billing in this town. And we have police violence against people of color. And we have people of color squeezed out of this town. More segregation in this town. This town is a very segregated place. It's shameful.

No more discussion about this and that. Oh, should we? Shouldn't we? You owe them. You owe people of color in this country $97 trillion, and that is at minimum wage.

If y'all can't see, it's a Black Power shirt with the Muhammad Ali quote in the back. This is who we really are. On the topic of these pretext stops and how they affect poor black people, like myself, they can have devastating  devastating consequences to people's livelihoods moving here. I'm sorry, people's livelihoods moving forward with their lives long after the interactions have occurred. Pretext stops often lead to contraband charges and all types of resisting arrest and fleeing and alluding and all types of other issues that had nothing to do with keeping the public safe fundamentally.  As things stand now, I have my own issues with the, I don't want to incriminate myself, but I have my own issues with the prosecutor's office as things stand right now stemming from this very issue. I have to say this publicly that it has been the mostly Democratic elected leaders in the prosecutor's office and in the sheriff's office that have offered the most resistance  to this kind of narrative. If you ask them, this stuff just isn't happening, right? They solved racism in 2020, upon the election of Ellie Savin and Company, and this type of narrative is very frustrating, especially from young black men who don't see very much representation in these kinds of spaces.

Slightly similar though. So everybody in the room listen. White folks, pay close attention. This is a conversation that I had with somebody recently. So I'm speaking from a point of privilege.  As white folks, we have the ability to kind of look at these things and do incremental change because we're kind of in the cat bird seat. Incremental change kind of serves us in some ways and it makes us feel good about what we're doing. You have to understand what's not even being fully expressed from the crowd because some people don't want to get up in here because they're going to lay into you because there are generations  of pain behind this. The time for incremental changes have passed. And so when we have these opportunities, when we have ARPA funds, when we have excise money, when we have things like this, we cannot do business as usual. We cannot do status quo. We cannot do something that is incremental because these things swing back. What happens two years when money gets tight again? Where are these things gonna come from?  We're going to be right back in the same situation. So everybody's telling you out here they're holding you accountable. And what they're holding you accountable is they want you to do something grand. They want you to not be afraid to fall on your freaking face. This is not a political issue. This is a matter of people's lives. And pseudo-liberalism that often takes place in Ann Arbor is worse.  than people who outright tell you they don't care about your issues. So you're hearing a lot of upset, you're hearing a lot of angst. I'm using my privilege at this point in time to tell you the day of the middle-aged white male was long and it was fruitful. The reason why I didn't want to come up here right away is because it isn't my time to speak.  Other people's voice need to be heard. And you're right, 400,000 is a start. It is a small start. It's a drop in the bucket. I don't know if 97 trillion is the number, but I know 400,000 isn't. So, I ask you to consider these things because people do pay attention to what happens in Ann Arbor. Maybe more than they should.  But the fact is, you can set precedent for other people. You can show people what is possible. You can be genuinely progressive and make a difference.

My name is Paul Fleming. I live in Ward 5 in the city. And while I'm here in my role as a community member, I'm also a faculty member at the School of Public Health at the University of Michigan. And I focus my research and teaching on approaches to public safety. I'm here in support of the Driving Equality Ordinance. And the testimony that's already been shared by residents is critically important. And I just want to add another perspective as well.  The proposed ordinance is in line with a policy statement by the American Public Health Association. The American Public Health Association is a 150-year-old body that represents a broad base of public health professionals. I and many of my colleagues at the School of Public Health are members of this association.  And in their policy statement, the organization urges municipal governments to, quote, advance equity and justice by decriminalizing and eliminating officer enforcement of regulations such as minor traffic violations, including expired registration and broken taillights.  among many other things that the policy statement says. I invite you to find the policy statement here at this QR code, as well as other city policies that the city can adopt to really address this issue. The American Public Health Association has made this policy recommendation based on years and years of rigorous research showing the harms of everyday policing, including traffic stops, the harms that can have on residents, especially marginalized residents.  This ordinance will also complement the unarmed response program that the city will soon be funding. Ultimately, in a safe and equitable community, the research shows that interactions between residents and police should be minimized and access to supportive services should be expanded. The driving equality ordinance will help reduce the possible pathways to jail or prison and the unarmed response program will help increase supportive services for those in need.  The synergy of these two initiatives will lead to not just better public safety, but a community where there are better opportunities for all members to thrive. In public health, we try to prevent things before they're happening, and this driving a quality ordinance.  will help prevent discrimination, prevent the potential for police violence, and also prevent pathways to jails and prisons. I urge you to align our city with this research on the issue and pass the ordinance as a starting point to address these issues.

We know that racism, and in particular pretextual racism in terms of both traffic stops and stops while black people are simply walking, while are simply shopping, while are simply going about their daily lives, are mathematically demonstrable. This is something which is proven.  I think that, as many people have said before me, this is an excellent first step, but we also need to take a statistical and sane and racially equitable approach to examining other issues that involve escalation from a minor infraction, which, as we have discussed previously, may not even warrant criminal punishment whatsoever.  and escalate that into a much larger issue. As I said, these are issues that are not only affecting members of the community, especially people of colour, while they are driving. It affects them while they are going about their daily business. And I think we need to examine this issue in the broader context of the protections to the community that are brought by enforcing these principles versus the damage to the community, including escalation to use of force and potentially even death, in a broader context than just that which relates to motor vehicles.

I served in law enforcement for 10 years, so speaking on that perspective, I agree with a lot of comments that my colleagues have made. Thank you, Cynthia Harrison, and really all of city council for the work that you've done on this. Traffic stops are dangerous. We made a decision in this country long ago to use the police for literally almost everything under the sun when it comes to safety.  Traffic stops, when you're on the roadway as an officer, you can get hit. All kinds of things can happen. And then you're causing trauma for the people when you pull them over. No one likes getting pulled over. I think the majority of people in this room, when they get pulled over, their anxiety is going to go up. They're going to feel uncomfortable. And then for people that are in the black and brown community, there's a heightened fear that you might not live on that traffic stop.  When I was an officer, it was very hard for me to understand that when I first started, when I was talking to my friends. Because I thought, well, I'm just pulling you over for speeding, or I'm just pulling you over to remind you that you have a headlight out. And it took a long time in this career to really understand for my friends that we need to be more aware of the presence that we bring to people.  When we walk into rooms, when we are sitting at the park in the patrol car, when we pull people over, we can cause stress and anxiety. And there's traffic stops that I've done and I've seen how scared people were on those stops.  And so when there's situations where we can avoid those stops, we should do it. And shout out to Pullover Prevention. They've been doing a lot of work with fixing cars so people don't have to risk being stopped for these really low-level offenses.  If we started traffic stop policies right now, I don't think we would have the police stopping people for these extremely minor infractions. And so this ordinance is a step in the right direction. And we really have to do more to restructure traffic enforcement because we know that traffic stops kill people, they injure people.  And at the end of the day, safety needs to be the primary concern, not using the police in a way that they really have other things that they could be doing that would be a lot more beneficial than pulling people over for things like a crack in the windshield or loud exhaust or poverty-related things when you're driving a car.  And so I want to thank you all again. I really appreciate the process and all the collaboration. This has brought a lot of people together. And I'll rescind my time. Thanks. Thank you."}, {"start": 4977, "end": 5141, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "text": "Hello. My name is Laquan Hill.  I want to share a story with you real quick. I want you all to imagine an individual who made some mistakes in his life, right? And he did his time. He gets out. He changed his life. He did everything he's supposed to do while incarcerated. Came up with goals, came up with plans. He had minimum family support. One of his family members donated a car to him.  Carter's been sitting in the yard for however long. It needed a couple of things fixed on it. But this individual, prideful, he wanted to do something better than selling drugs, robbing people, right? But it just so happens the only jobs that was provided livable wage was in Ann Arbor. So he took a chance.  He said, no, I'm going to go. I'm going to go fill out many applications I possibly can. He has his driver's license. The car is legally supposed to be on the road, but he doesn't have the funds to fix the headlight. The headlight from the kids that was playing on the block one day, playing ball. You know, we all did that once before. You didn't get your windows busted out before, right? Well, just imagine, kids, being kids,  and the headlight is busted. A guy coming home, he want a job, that's all he want. He don't want to go back to prison. He don't want to go back to the things that he used to do that got him back in prison, so he took a chance. He drove to Ann Arbor and got pulled over. He got the ticket, came back, he's dead now.  He's dead now. You know why? Because he got the efforts. I tried. This was my chance. I tried. All because of a traffic stop. So again, this ordinance is good, and I thank you.

But one thing I would like to add, that I've really enjoyed the conversation, hearing the stories today, because they're not part of the report. I think they're actually probably more important for helping shape the decision here tonight. But what the study did find, it was that there are disparities here in Ann Arbor.  that is incontrovertible, and that the largest disparities have to do with the specific types of stops we're talking about tonight, which are equipment violations.  We've come to that realization. Some people already knew that here in this room. Some people didn't. This is one way to show it. But I'd also like to point out that these kinds of efforts, I'd really like to applaud the thought and time and carefulness and care that went into thinking about what we can do about these problems we identify.  And especially what I enjoy as a resident of Ann Arbor, as well as a researcher, what I really applaud about the ordinance on the table tonight is that it really shifts the onus on taking responsibility for our safety to this room.  that there are other kinds of responses that could have occurred and maybe still should occur. Maybe we should think about different kinds of training, different kinds of recruitment, different kinds of technologies. I don't know. Those could maybe be down the line.

My name is Marta Nelson, and I'm the Director of Government Strategy for the Vera Institute of Justice. Vera works to end mass incarceration, protect immigrants' rights, and build safe, thriving communities. Vera is leading a cohort of 10 cities and counties from across the country who are interested in improving traffic safety and reducing racial disparities in traffic enforcement. Councilmember Harrison is part of this learning community.  Backed by the evidence, cities from Philadelphia to Memphis, states from Virginia to Oregon have enacted policies that remove police from enforcement of non-safety-related stops. By various counts, at least 12 jurisdictions nationwide have passed such policies, while at least 10 have done so by police order and four by prosecutorial policy. Extensive research shows that these policies provide four key benefits.  First, research shows that policies like the Driving Equality Ordinance improve traffic safety by focusing police stops on unsafe driving behavior. Second, ending non-safety-related stops can promote public safety and community trust, as the frequency of these stops compounds distrust in government institutions such as police departments and prosecutor's offices, which depend on the public's cooperation to solve crime.  Third, these policies bear more drivers of the physical, psychological, and economic harms caused by traffic stops. And fourth, these policies reduce harmful racial disparities. As we have heard tonight about the recent report in Ann Arbor, that found significant racial disparities across the board, but particularly for equipment violations. And the findings in Ann Arbor are consistent with research nationwide  finding greater disparities in non-safety-related stops than in safety-related stops. Eliminating these stops worked. After Philadelphia instituted its policy on low-level stops, traffic stops involving Black men went down 54%. Now, opponents of these policies tend to argue that they're necessary for fighting crime and keeping the roads safe, both of which are unsupported by evidence. Regarding public safety, these stops rarely result in the recovery of guns or other contraband.  A national study found that the police recovered guns in fewer than 1% of non-safety-related stops, while another study found that the eight largest California police departments recovered guns in just 0.5% of all traffic stops. And regarding road safety, banning low-level stops does not prohibit police from making traffic stops due to more serious equipment violations, like two missing headlights or anything causing visibly reckless driving.  A Connecticut analysis found that the equipment violations in forced and low-level stops do not contribute to accidents. Finally, polling shows that policies like the Driving Quality Orders have strong bipartisan vote support. Voters clearly understand that there are better ways to handle these issues, as do members of Ann Arbor who are considering this initiative. So I urge you to vote for them.

I will be brief because you've heard from lots of folks already, and I would like to second basically everyone who's spoken in support of this ordinance.  In addition to all of the insightful testimony that you've heard here tonight and all of the elements that are listed in the findings section of the proposed ordinance, I'd also like to emphasize that people with mental illness are also disproportionately represented in the criminal legal system and black people with mental illness even more so.  According to NAMI Michigan, about one in four people with a serious mental illness have been arrested by the police at some point in their lifetime. And about two in five adults in jail or prison have a history of mental illness. Jail is not the right place for these folks to end up. If we stop picking up people for non-criminal activities and stop them from entering the prison pipeline,  We not only work to reduce the racial inequity in our community, as you've heard all throughout the evening, but we can also work towards getting people with mental health conditions the medical and social services they need rather than continuing to fill our jail.

By passing this ordinance, we are communicating to people across the nation who have feared or suffered the consequences of low-level secondary traffic stops that Ann Arbor welcomes you. We are saying that as a City Council, we understand that these stops have long incited fear, tension, and sadly, have even cost lives and communities.  At the first reading, we grappled with the weight of American policing's history and trauma, underscoring the need for transformative change. We heard heartbreaking narratives from Ann Arbor residents and visitors about their encounters with police during these stops. These were stark reminders of the pressing need to reform how law enforcement interacts with those they protect.  I'd like to extend my appreciation to the Ann Arbor Police Department for understanding that this is not an indictment on their profession, but a stride towards healing historical harm and fostering trust within our community. I and the rest of the community appreciate your diligence and commitment to keeping our city safe. Let's not overlook that this ordinance also serves as a protective measure for our officers.  Over the last decade, traffic fatalities have been one of the leading causes of officer deaths nationwide. By curtailing unnecessary traffic stops, we can reduce this risk. The Driving Equality Ordinance is all about safety. This ordinance plays an essential part in achieving our city's Vision Zero goals. It aims to enhance road safety for everyone in Ann Arbor, be they drivers, cyclists, or pedestrians.  We've seen commendable progress in reducing car accidents over the last five years, yet over 2,500 accidents a year and 17 fatal and incapacitating injury crashes in 2021, there is still much work to do. By eliminating these low-level stops, we can redirect our police resources to tackling serious traffic offenses, making our roads safer.  Furthermore, it seeks to create a safer environment for our black and brown drivers who have been traumatized by nationwide police violence. A recent report shows that non-white drivers in Ann Arbor are stopped and searched more frequently than white drivers. No black person in America can escape the fear and trauma of traffic stops. As a black mother, I know this trauma all too well.  Every black parent has to have the talk with their children about how to survive a traffic stop. The resulting long-term physical and psychological harm is well documented in academic research. And I would like, at this point, to make an amendment that I've circulated with Clerk Baldry.

It is to clarify and strengthen the language of the ordinance so that the public is clearly advised of their rights and law enforcement is clearly advised of their duties.

It demonstrates our commitment to ensuring that all people are treated equally by our law enforcement officers, irrespective of their background or circumstances.  I know that some of you have expressed concern over the part of the ordinance that prohibits officers from initiating a traffic stop for loud exhaust. I want to be sure to alleviate your concerns with respect to loud exhaust stops, as none of us wants an Ann Arbor where noise negatively affects children playing in our neighborhoods, impacts our ability to conduct business, or lessens the enjoyment of our outdoor spaces.  Please understand that this ordinance does not prohibit traffic enforcement in any way. Citations can still be issued in accordance with the law. Changes can still be sought as part of a larger safety-related stop or in conjunction with the investigation of a traffic crash. It doesn't mean that we are ignoring or tolerating loud exhaust, but rather we are enforcing this violation in a new way that does not cause trauma or disproportionately impacts any specific demographic.

Thank you to Councilmember Harrison for all her work on this. I'd like to be added as a co-sponsor and I'd like to just add a couple personal notes. It's hard not to sit here and think about family, especially when I recognize so many people that were sitting out here and spoke earlier today.  You know, my mom was raised black in Detroit, and my dad was raised black in Mount Vernon, New York, and they both chose to move to Ann Arbor shortly after I was born because it would be a better place to raise their black son. Their upbringings gave them no illusions about the risk for black men growing up anywhere in America, but they thought that by teaching me  they could help alleviate some of the worries that we've all talked about today, about police stops and what to do when you're stopped. Even so, a few years ago, when I heard a pop after backing into a pole in a parking lot, my first thought was not about confirming the type of damage that occurred, but rather a silent prayer that I had not cracked my taillight, because I immediately feared the potential of being stopped for it later that night.  Luckily, I'd only cracked the plastic casing and no white light escaped from the fixture, which allowed me to breathe a sigh of relief. This is the kind of mental weight the specter of these stops causes in black and brown communities. Let's pass this ordinance tonight and lift the worries about these secondary stops from the minds of minorities and from the minds of people who simply can't afford to fix their cars. Let's also lift the task of these stops  from the plate of police officers who have larger public safety issues to deal with. As the first black man to sit around this table since Larry Hunter, who represented Ward 1, like Councilmember Harrison does, until 1997, I think it is quite poignant that Councilmember Hunter had his own direct experience with the secondary stop. He was arrested by Washtenaw County Sheriff's deputies after being a passenger in a vehicle  that was stopped for a cracked taillight in 1991, the year I was born. His Ward 1 colleague, Ann Marie Coleman, a white woman, was outraged. She was quoted in the Ann Arbor News saying, everyone reports that when they have a taillight out and they're stopped by police, they get a warning. I'm speechless that they did all they did with Mr. Chauncey and Mr. Hunter.  Mr. Hunter ended up winning his case and having his charges dropped But the question becomes if a council member who knew his rights and knew he had nothing and done nothing wrong Could still be in thrown in jail as a result of a secondary stop. How can we ensure that anyone? Will get a fair shake 32 years later this ordinance change will come too late for mr. Hunter, but I'm proud to support it tonight.

And I was really happy to hear from community members, researchers, because this work is also backed by research, public health data. The city and the county had committed to racism as a public health crisis back in 2020. And I think during the pandemic, we kind of thought that we had health disparities, access to health services, the life expectancy differences across our zip codes, right? There is a 14-year life expectancy difference for black folks in Ann Arbor, Ypsi.  But public health is also related to public safety. The quality of life is related to these issues. And when I spoke to Dr. Paul Fleming a couple years ago, one statistic really stood out for me in that was that death by police is the sixth leading cause of death for black men.  It's a fact. It's backed by data. And for us to, as local officials in our own limited ways, to respond to that, I mean, when you hear that, you can't forget that. And that was, that's not only a call to action, but also a call for conversations.  in a number of ways with our community members. We see community leaders here bonding in a peace neighborhood. We've talked to other social service agency directors, but I also talked to neighbors, and one local father had expressed how  And I shared this with Cynthia earlier, that his worries are not just daily for his son, for his teenager, but given the violence in this country, he actually had to send them abroad for the summer. He felt better sending him out of this country than staying here as a black townie.  We know that another data reference that I had shared with Cynthia was also from a report on racial equity framework for gun violence prevention. This is from Johns Hopkins School of Public Health and the DC Justice Labs. Black men are stopped by police, arrested, denied bail, convicted and wrongfully convicted, and issued long sentences at much higher rates than their white counterparts. As a result, nearly half of all black men will be arrested before the age of 23.  I think we like to think Ann Arbor is an exception to every rule, but we are, we're not an exception.

We heard at the last meeting about an individual who simply couldn't afford to fix their exhaust and was fearful every time that they had to drive their car because of the threat of a stop. And one, we have to stop criminalizing poverty in that way.  But I also, from my experience, there is a souped up motorcycle that I see often near my neighborhood that every time it drives by, everybody has to stop their conversation because it's so loud. And nobody's calling the police on that person because 30 seconds after they've gone by, we've forgotten about it and our lives have moved on. And we have to stop allowing this comfort trade-off  for this modest inconvenience or this modest annoyance to be a trade-off for the true trauma and harm and danger that individuals may be in if the police were called on them or they were stopped for that reason. And so that is why this is included in the ordinance as well. And I'm grateful that we didn't hear from folks coming out in droves  I'm grateful that none of my colleagues wanted to do that either. And then I also just wanted to very briefly give voice because we've heard a lot about the impact that this has on members of the black and brown community here in Ann Arbor and folks who are coming to Ann Arbor. But we actually haven't heard a lot about also the increased level of stops that the LGBTQ community faces, and particularly trans women and trans women of color.  face as well. And so I want to give voice to that aspect of this as well because this is also an LGBTQ issue. And I think I'm just really grateful that we're moving this forward and we can take this next step to making sure that members of our community are safer. Thank you."}, {"start": 7261, "end": 7336, "speaker": "SPEAKER_22", "text": "I've also thanked Councilmember Harrison for all your efforts in bringing this forward. And I also want to name something that we haven't discussed a lot about, but the fact that secondary traffic stops are often a source of revenue for cities.  And according to the 2015 Ferguson report released by the Department of Justice, cities that have a higher proportion of revenue that's sourced from fines and fees are more likely to have discriminatory policing practices, are more likely to have community distrust of the police.  are more likely just to not be as safe of a community because there's distrust. So I want to urge us to think, you know, obviously this is a good step in the right direction, but in general, how are resourcing fines and fees and just staying cognizant of that as well.  I also thank, you know, Council Member Redina for pointing out this is also affecting LGBTQ drivers. And in reading the report, I also saw that it's had a significant impact on Asian American and Middle Eastern drivers. And the city is one of the largest Asian American populations in the state, so it's significant. Thank you."}, {"start": 7336, "end": 7343, "speaker": "SPEAKER_19", "text": "Further discussion?

As we vote on the Driving Equality Ordinance, we are not just enacting law but setting a precedent. A precedent for prioritizing the well-being of every resident in Ann Arbor over the tedious enforcement of minor traffic violations. We have heard the voices of those impacted by these stops during public comment and throughout the deliberation process. And tonight, we are acting on your behalf.  The dialogue we've engaged in with groups such as the Vera Institute of Justice, the ACLU, ICPAC, and Philadelphia Council Member Isaiah Thomas have been crucial in shaping this ordinance.  These fruitful collaborations have helped us consider every aspect of this issue and our aim to address the chronic stress and unfair burden of low-level secondary traffic stops. Why an ordinance and not merely a policy? The answer lies in the long-lasting and binding nature of ordinances. A policy is internal, not public. It cannot be legally enforced, nor can voters hold us accountable to it.  An ordinance is law. We seek to enforce a change that is resilient, firm, and not subject to the variability of future administrative decisions.  As we stand on the brink of voting on this ordinance, let us remember the journey that has brought us here. The tales of heartbreaking anguish and the calls for change have been our guiding light. I want to thank my fellow co-sponsors, Mayor Taylor and City staff, the Director of Organizational Equity, Laura Orta, the City Attorney's Office, and an extra special thank you to our new Senior Assistant,  City Attorney Jen Janetzky, whose relentless dedication and commitment has brought us to that to this point today.  Now is the time for us to take a bold step forward. To show our city and the nation that we value equity, fairness, and justice above all. We are prepared to do what is right, to lessen the burden on those who have been disproportionately affected, and to ensure that every interaction between our police and the public is rooted in respect and understanding. As we cast our votes, let's remind ourselves of the profound significance of this moment.  Our decisions today will echo far into the future, shaping an Ann Arbor that is safer and more equitable to all of our residents. Thank you for your unwavering commitment to this cause. Now let's make history."}, {"start": 7506, "end": 7614, "speaker": "SPEAKER_19", "text": "Further discussion?  That's a hard one to follow, but I'll just be brief. Fundamentally, it is incredibly important that our law enforcement focus in our community be the promotion of public safety performed with professionalism and without bias in favor.  The secondary stops addressed by this ordinance are not necessary to affect public safety, simply put. Crucially, however, they unnecessarily disrupt the lives of community members, they corrode trust and confidence between police and community, and they can lead to fear, tension, and harm, as we've heard time and time again.  I'm very grateful that Councilmember Harrison, Chief Metzer, and of course the Law Department and other staff up and down the line have worked hard to put together an ordinance, which I believe is an exemplar of where I hope other jurisdictions will quickly follow. But finally and most importantly, I'm grateful and am proud for our community's common commitment. And importantly, our acknowledgement of the great and complex work that still needs to be done.  to make Ann Arbor a place where all are welcome and where all feel and indeed are safe and respected.

This is something that my colleague Councilmember Briggs and I received an email about from a Ward five resident who was cited was issued a citation for putting out a dollhouse for one of their neighbors to  pick up and recycle within their own home and use by their own children. And I had no idea that this was something that was illegal. So this ordinance allows the curbside placement of household items, appliances, bikes, kitchen gadgets, electronics, garden tools, etc. in any good condition can be placed near the curb once a week for 48 hours.  They can be placed in the public right of way in front of the property that is owned or occupied by that person. The item may not be placed in a roadway, sidewalk or any path of travel, thus ensuring safe  safe travel throughout the city may not impede vision or create any physical obstruction for pedestrians, vehicle operators or bicyclists and mice must be clearly labeled that they are intended for donation or reuse. And so this in my mind is a no brainer. It's encouraging our 800 goals and promoting the circular economy that we want to promote within the city. So I will be supporting it.
