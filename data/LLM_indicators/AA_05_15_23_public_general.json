My name's Derek Miller, resident of Ward 4 and executive director of Community Action Network. I'm here today to advocate for the inclusive and transformative celebration of Ann Arbor's bicentennial.  As we commemorate two centuries of growth, progress, and community spirit, I urge you to consider the Southeast Area Park as a perfect location for a thrilling and much-needed splash zone or other park amenities. As stated in the resolution to direct the City Administrator to designate Southeast Area Park as the 2024 Bicentennial Park. Why Southeast Area Park? It is a beacon of opportunity for the residents of Southeast Ann Arbor, the largest concentration of low-income individuals in our city.  This community deserves not only commemoration, but tangible investments that uplift their lives. By choosing Southeast Area Park as specified in the resolution, we have the chance to create an accessible and empowering space for families, children, and individuals who may have limited recreational options. Moreover, the presence of Community Action Network, also known as CAN, in this area further highlights the significance of Southeast Area Park. CAN serves three under-resourced neighborhoods in this area, and these communities would directly benefit from the creation of this park and its amenities.  Ken has expressed his commitment to coordinating visits to this amazing amenity, ensuring that children and families who face economic barriers can experience the joy and respite it offers. But let us not forget that there is also still an incredible need for human services support in this area. Just today, Ken's largest food distribution at Bryan Community Center ran out midday and will not be replenished until Wednesday. Sadly, this has become a common occurrence by designating Southeast Area Park as the 2024 Bicentennial Park  We have the opportunity to address not only the need for recreational spaces, but also urgent need for vital services. We can send a powerful message to our community that our community stands united in supporting our most vulnerable residents. Moreover, Southeast Area Park's strategic location near multiple neighborhoods and various busing options ensures that families from different parts of the city can access the water park with ease.  Transportation should never be a barrier to enjoyment, and by selecting this part, as outlined in the resolution, we make a bold statement of our commitment to equitable access for all residents, regardless of their socioeconomic circumstances. Let us seize this occasion, the bicentennial celebration, to make a lasting impact on our community. I implore you to consider the long-lasting benefits, the positive impact on marginalized populations, and the opportunity to foster a sense of unity that transcends socioeconomic context. As outlined in the resolution,  to choose Southeast Area Park as the home for the Bicentennial Park and let us celebrate our history by creating a future that is truly inclusive, vibrant, and accessible to all. Thank you for your time."}, {"start": 990.525, "speaker": "SPEAKER_06", "text": "Go ahead. Okay. Sorry about that. This is Kitty Kahn. I live in the fifth floor. I'm calling about something that I heard City Administrator DeHoney say at the May 9th meeting of the Ann Arbor Council Administration Committee.  This is a meeting that was broadcast audio only. It was not on Zoom, nor was it televised. Mr. DeHoney spoke about his plan for the city to build market rate housing next to City Hall. He had mentioned this when he gave his budget presentation to City Council about a month ago, but he went into more detail on May 9th. Now, I'm going to quote Mr. DeHoney. He said, quote,  Assuming that we get past the budget on Monday and Council doesn't say don't do it. Starting May 16th, I'm off.\" Then, Mr. DeHoney clarified exactly what the proposed development would look like.  Quoting Mr. De Coney again, he said, quote, it's high end, market rate, high level finishes. You want to charge as much as possible. You want this thing to generate as much cash as possible. That's why I did not say let's use it for affordable housing, unquote. Let me repeat what he said because it shocked me when I heard it. He said, and listen carefully,  It's high end, market rate, high level finishes. You want to charge as much as possible. You want this thing to generate as much cash as possible. That's why I did not say let's use it for affordable housing, unquote.  I'd like to hear more about Mr. DeHoney's plan, and I want him to explain how this fits into our city's need for affordable and workforce housing. We have a lot of high-end market-rate housing in our city already. Do we really want our tax dollars to pay for even more of that? I know I don't. What about you? Mr. DeHoney says his plan is a way for the city to raise money. He wants to put the same high-end housing on the Klein lot.  But I've seen the city play developer before, and we end up losing money on that scheme. Maybe Mr. Gahoney doesn't know about that. Somebody should fill him in. I think probably a lot of the new council members, probably everybody on council now doesn't know about when the city tried to play developer before, but it didn't end up well.  Instead, why don't we try to live within our means and realign our priorities? For example, Council Chambers was redone just seven years ago. Does it need to be redone again now with a mural on the ceiling, really? This is only one example. I'm sure we could find many more. Thank you."}, {"start": 1241.302, "speaker": "SPEAKER_16", "text": "Hi, I wanted to call in again to speak against the plan to have downtown foot patrols by police. I think that we have a perfectly good solution in having  In having supportive services and supportive connections and EMT is going around downtown and we don't need to have  police there as well, because police will increase the danger to our Black community members, to our other minority community members who would like to have equal opportunity to use the downtown without being harassed. And if  You know, if this is something that the downtown business owners are like pressuring us into doing because they don't like to have a certain type of person in front of their business, then We need to tell them that that's just the price of living in a free society that you can't you can't just use the police as a cudgel to get rid of all the undesirables for you. So,  Please don't have the police walking around downtown harassing people. And I think that it's, it's been enough years since the largest popular uprising in history happened around the George Floyd protests. There's been enough time around that, that we should have internalized the lesson that there are  that the police put certain members of our community in danger more than they help anybody. And that we should be looking for other better solutions rather than increasing police presence. So please rethink that plan.  and move forward as quickly as possible with the unarmed response program. Let's get that RFP out, make sure it includes things like a separate number people can call if they don't want to call 9-1-1, if they want to make sure that police don't show up to these wellness checks. 30 seconds.  make sure police are not involved in unarmed response calls, because that would make them into armed response calls. So that's where we should be focusing is that unarmed response and not on increasing armed response presence."}, {"start": 1472.187, "speaker": "SPEAKER_10", "text": "As a resident of Ann Arbor, Michigan,  I declare today to be Nakba Day, N-A-K-B-A, Nakba Day in Ann Arbor City Council. The Nakba is the ongoing mass murder and mass robbery that is committed against the Palestinian people with your tax dollars every day by Israel.  In just the last week, you saw on the news Israel blowing down whole buildings, blowing down homes, murdering children in their beds while they slept. You saw all that on your TV news. This is what Israel does with your military aid, with your tax dollars, with your $3.8 billion every year. And the mayor here,  The mayor here has the balls to pretend that he's for minorities, he's for Asian-Americans. That's bullshit. What happened to Vincent Chin, where he was murdered with impunity, happens every day in occupied Palestine, paid for by your tax dollars.  So don't pretend that you are against that kind of violence that happened to Vincent Chin because Israel has created thousands of Vincent Chins with even more impunity than the killers of Vincent got. Even more impunity.  You, the Ann Arbor City Council, have thrown all your weight against every single resolution that tries to object  to the mountain of military aid that you give to Israel, even when that resolution came from your own Ann Arbor Human Rights Commission, even then, you threw your weight against all those Palestinian human rights resolutions. So don't even try to pretend you're against racism.  You are committing racist crimes against the Palestinian people every single time you turn your back and throw your weight against Palestinian rights resolutions. That's why I believe this city council is racist to the bone. Tonight you'll hear weeping and wailing about the Black Lives Matter yellow paint in the park.  Whoever defaced that, I hope, gets the maximum penalty for that, for hate crime and for vandalism, I hope. But good God, is that the maximum you have to give to the black community? A dab of yellow paint on the sidewalk? That's all you're gonna give to the black community after everything you've taken away? This is the kind of racist city council we are dealing with."}, {"start": 1657.686, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "text": "Hello, Ann Arbor. I am also here to speak  for Palestinian human rights. I have been doing it for many, many years here. This city council wants you to believe they're anti-racist. They want to tell you that they love black people, but that's all garbage. They are liars. Their record shows that they do not want blacks in this town. This city has been gentrified.  30 years ago, this town had a vibrant black community. Today, that black community does not exist. They've been squeezed out. In fact, the old west side was wall-to-wall African-American black families. Today, you barely find any black people there. So when they tell you they love blacks and they love Black Lives Matter movement, they're lying. Another case.  University of Michigan, 50 years ago, promised 10% black enrollment. To this day, that has not happened. To this day, no one on this council or any other council has pushed University of Michigan to do good on their promise 50 years ago. In fact, University of Michigan is one of the most atrocious  when it comes to black enrollment. It is the lowest anywhere in the United States. University of Michigan promised 10% black enrollment. To this day, no one in this city council has demanded that they do it.  Come and do it. Make sure 10% enrollment of blacks happen. They never have. So you can see their record shows who they are. They are anti-black. They are anti-Palestinian. They are racist. There is no way you can sell this bunch to anyone and say they're not racist. They are racist. They are racist to the bone, as Blaine said, and their actions show it.  We will not be fooled by you, Mr. Mayor. When I call you a phony, it's because I know who you are and what you have done. Indeed, you are a phony, Mr. Mayor. And when you say diversity, your voice shakes because you yourself don't believe yourself. When you say you are not a racist, you are a racist, Mr. Mayor. Mayor Taylor, you are a racist.  Palestinian people are dying every day with the billions of dollars of tax dollars that the United States government hands over to Israel. Children die every day. Ms. America here knows it, and she told me that she knows that Palestinian children are dying.  Ms. Briggs, which I spoke to a few weeks ago, she says she knows that I am right when I say children of Palestine are dying with your tax dollars. She says, yes, I know. And I suppose that if she knows, everyone else does know too. They listen to the news, they listen to what's happening. So these people are racists, don't believe them."}], "public_comments_2": [{"start": 1996.467, "speaker": "SPEAKER_13", "text": "Hi, this is Alex Lowe calling in from South Southeast Eastern Arbor. I want to speak on a few topics which will leave me very little time to speak without euphemism, but I'll try to keep it brief.  To start, I want to echo the thoughts of Treasurer Duckworth. She is absolutely correct. Second, I want to thank council members Garzi Edwin, Regina, Harrison, Watson, and Dish for sponsoring the resolution to designate Southeast Area Park as the 2024 Bicentennial Park. This park is both well used and very undervalued by the city, and I hope that we can change  Next, I'd like to ask the city to modify the fiscal year 2024 budget. First, we need to redirect some of that police budget to unarmed response. There's a $1.75 FTE increase for the police. Let's give that to unarmed response instead. Additionally, there's $800,000 on the budget for a replacement fire engine. This is great.  But I think that we should direct the fire department to purchase a much smaller fire truck, like we're starting to see in cities like San Francisco and London and Tokyo.  The current ones that we've got are massively oversized and do not fit on properly human scale streets, which just forces more impermeable surface in a new development, just because the only fire trucks that are available are these monstrosities.  And finally, I want to talk about the PUD on South Forest. I hope that this passes, but the fact that this has to be a PUD shows that our zoning is not working. This should not be a PUD. This should be a buy-write development. Let's fix our zoning so that more developments like these can happen buy-write. Thank you."}, {"start": 2147.218, "speaker": "SPEAKER_26", "text": "Good evening, City Council. Just briefly, I'm on the agenda to speak about the enactment of Resolution R-22-363. Six months ago, this body and five people who are sitting here tonight voted in favor of a resolution directing our city administrator to investigate the establishment and funding of an office of the ombudsperson for the city of Ann Arbor, which I think would take care of a lot of the concerns that people have, the community have, about the poor customer service here at City Hall. And that's not me making something up. It's in your reports if you read them.  And that resolution that was passed by the body resolved that the city administrator report back these findings at a regular council meeting prior to the finalization of the budget, which is tonight. And that didn't happen as far as I know. I didn't see anything about that. And I don't see a place where we're in the budget. Now we had, I know there's potentially like some short memories on here, but one effort of this body should be to see what the previous body had to do. And there should be some effort at continuity, especially when it's something that's for the good of the whole community.  So, you know, we'll write it off to short memories and hope that you have this opportunity to change and get that forward tonight. Otherwise, we're going to write it off to the considerations that maybe this body isn't trustworthy. Now, I got a chuckle when I heard the mayor stand up here and say that he stands for constant expressions of pluralism. And when I spoke at our last meeting, I was not unfortunately interrupted by these good advocates behind me to speak  about no US military aid to Israel. And I do not support military aid to Israel. And I would call for it myself. And I do not support military aid to any country. And the United States has been handing out $12 billion or so every year for the last decade that we know about in direct purchases or funneled through third parties. And essentially what the United States does with this money, Israel or any other country, is prop up the small arms industries.  And so when I go downtown and I see the moms demand action against firearms down there, and I say moms should be demanding action against all military aid anywhere, because all that is doing is propping up our small arms industries. We sent billions and billions of rounds of ammunition, millions of rounds of ammunition, everything, all over the world. It's disgusting. And that's just what we know about. That's the overt operations. So that this body can't come forward and make a general statement against war. If you're not working for peace, if one isn't working for peace, what are we working for here?  It's the basis of everything. And on this day, on May 15th, it's especially so. And so I want to apologize to the Palestinian community for not taking my opportunity when I sat at that table to bring forward a resolution. But as these folks have been pointing out for some years, you can see what I would have been up against there. So I doubt that it would have even been discussed. Now I got to comment on something. We got a big call to defund the police. The average police department has 2.4 people for every 1,000 residents. We have one.  2.4 officers, we have one officer for every 1000 residents. This city only has 97 police officers. Okay. They're complaining about the state, the police state. Yes, state power is a danger. Well, then no more military aid to Israel or anybody else. Get rid of the state power. If you want to defund the police, get the arms out of our community and out of the world."}, {"start": 2352.556, "speaker": "SPEAKER_19", "text": "Can you hear me?

But you can't have a well community or safe community unless you have a well community. And we know well communities happen one individual at a time.  And the way we think about wellness is the majority, if not all, of our community members, our neighborhood members, are physically, psychologically, and emotionally healthy. We know food insecurity and housing insecurity is not a challenge in our neighborhoods. Well communities happen when we have robust transportation. It happens when we have neighborhoods that are as best as we can get at trauma-free.  And we have to make sure that we not only do that to the people that are outside that don't get impacted by our training and legal systems, but those that do. And everybody should have hope and the opportunity to be a contributing member of the community. And we know the impact of incarceration on folks and how it sometimes can derail them from realizing their own potential. I think $400,000 as a result of this excise act and the benefit from this excise act  is a small investment towards what we hope to be this continuing effort to put people on the path to contributing to the community, making our community safe by making our community well.

This is Tom Stahlberg. I'm calling from Lower Town in Ann Arbor. And I'd like to wear some different hats tonight, as I often do. As a landlord, I'd like to talk about E4, the Renter's Commission's recommendation.  Support your renters. They're the lower power people in the equation between renters and landlords. Some landlords have found workarounds. I guess the new laws for protecting renters are going to need some iterations, so please pay attention to the Renter's Commission and the recommendations as far as wait lists and other workarounds. Also, the Renter's Commission, I'll speak on E2 and E4 both, because the Renter's Commission  has advocated for sustainability, as has the Environmental Commission and the Energy Commission, and they all have resolutions before you dealing with natural gas for both heating and for appliances. And I'm sure you've read the details of those various resolutions. Whatever we do, we must do something more than what we are currently doing. And we must do so promptly. As they ask of you, please treat this  with the great urgency fitting a declared emergency. And as they ask, please, with equal urgency, implement carrot and stick measures to promote sustainable construction. As a landlord and property owner of multiple smaller properties, not any large projects, we're trying to implement various things and learning as we go. I just read another article today that talked about ways  that can overcome some of the hurdles we've been facing in our investigations on how to implement air source heat pumps into our properties. We're doing what we can, and I know a lot of people are doing what they can, and citizens are doing what they can, and citizen groups are doing what they can to educate ourselves and to improve what we have in terms of our existing housing stock. It is essential for our new housing stock to not  put us into a hole that we cannot fall out of if we're going to meet our 820 goals by 2030. So please, listen to those resolutions. Also, on C1, I'll put on my developer's hat. C1 is the 721 South Forest PUD re-zoning. Staff recommends that the PUD zoning district be denied because it's not consistent with the comprehensive land use plan. The proper process would be  Revise the plan for that area. You don't have to go to that area prior to considering a zone, something that doesn't and you need to do it for the area, not for an individual property. 1 property at a time.

I waited for the community.  a revised or comprehensive plan, and only then did they grant me the zoning. They did. They liked the project. The community liked the project. It works for everybody. Please follow the law. Thank you."}, {"start": 2697.375, "speaker": "SPEAKER_23", "text": "Hi Council, Brandon Dimchoff from West Larrytown in the 4th Ward. I'm here to ask you to approve C1, also known as the 721 South Forest PUD. If constructed, this will replace a 50-unit run-down apartment building and parking lot with a development that has 733 bedrooms, a couple hundred bike parking spots, and even some retail.  It's an all-electric building, just like we've been requesting from developers, and will provide $4.7 million to the Affordable Housing Fund. Despite being less than a block from other dense housing near campus, and advancing Council's stated goals of building environmentally friendly mixed-use developments to help alleviate the housing crisis, the staff report recommended against approval, and planning was split 6-2, but in favor.  I attended the meeting and read the documents, and the objections seemed to be that the project wouldn't be appropriate for the area by the letter of existing council policy. Maybe that's true, but it feels like it fits to me. On a recent bike ride through the area, I stopped in front of the parking area of the existing building, and I can see a number of taller buildings without really even having to squint.  A seven-story parking structure is basically across the street, and there are similar tall buildings another half a block away. The building would fit in the area just fine. I hope council approves this PUD today, but if you do, this tells me that there is a mismatch between what council and staff and planning believes is our policy on building dense housing close to downtown and campus.  Every time there's a mismatch like this, I think it's worth examining if there are simple policy changes we can make before doing the entire comprehensive plan to set reasonable expectations for these sorts of projects. I don't know what that would look like in detail, but I hope that there's something short term we can do akin to a quick build transportation project that doesn't require years of process to implement. Doing these as one-off PODs is pretty inefficient. There's got to be a better way. Please set some kind of policy.  so that we get what we want and we need.

I have many questions about this project proposed by the city administrator, probably other members of the public do too. But my most nagging question is this. What are the ethics of building city-owned luxury housing as a source of city revenue in a city that so badly needs affordable housing?  An earlier commenter pointed out that we already have a lot of luxury housing, we need affordable housing. I would very much like to hear all City Council members weigh in on this matter. Many City Council members say very little during City Council meetings. So this is a chance to make your voices heard. Because if you remain silent,  Your constituents could interpret your silence as support for the city administrator to begin the process of planning for what he described as high and market rate housing that would generate as much cash as possible.

I'd like to express my support for amendments two and three of DS-3. These amendments will allow us to better support some of our most vulnerable neighbors in our local community. These resources are especially important considering we're seeing both increases in both acuity and the number of people seeking services over the past year.  This past winter alone, we saw an increase of almost 20% of those seeking overnight shelter, and now almost 70% of our guests we serve have a disability, more often than not being a serious chronic health condition, with many coming out of the hospital or other settings. These amendments allow us to target additional resources to returning citizens and those impacted by the criminal justice system, helping address systemic barriers and the impact of systemic racism.  I appreciate that these amendments highlight utilizing a trauma-informed lens as well, giving special attention to the incredibly challenging circumstances our guests go through every day, and the importance of bringing an empathetic and client-centered approach that focuses on addressing that trauma. I do want to point out one specific item in Amendment 3, recommending that the service population be expanded to not just those who already have a tenant-based voucher, but also to provide support for those returning citizens with seeking  obtaining and identifying a tenant-based voucher. That would broaden the service array, and I think the voucher process is really hard to navigate, so providing additional support on the front end would be a huge boon. I want to give a special thank you to Councilmembers Briggs and Harrison for reaching out recently over the last few weeks to explore ways to better serve some of our most vulnerable neighbors, and thank the entire Council for bringing these amendments forward to support  some of our most vulnerable neighbors here in our community.
