And then hopefully you can say a few words after. This is a proclamation designating September 2023, Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month, Tye Michigan Teal. Whereas Tye Michigan Teal is a statewide campaign designed to promote awareness of ovarian cancer and its symptoms.  and whereas teal is the color representing ovarian cancer and whereas ovarian cancer is the deadliest of the gynecologic cancers and one of the five leading cancer-related deaths among women in the United States and whereas in 2023 approximately 19,700 women will be diagnosed with the disease and sadly 13,270 women will die and whereas women diagnosed with ovarian cancer have an average five-year survival rate  of 45 percent. And whereas unlike other cancers, there's no early detection test for ovarian cancer, and because symptoms which are often subtle and mimic other diseases, awareness of symptoms is key to early diagnosis.  Whereas Tye Michigan Teal consists of volunteers tying ribbons on trees, signposts, and providing local businesses and offices with symptom information cards. Whereas Tye Michigan Teal takes place the entire month of September and the City of Royal Oak supports their efforts to educate our residents and all members of the public about ovarian cancer and its symptoms.  And now therefore be it resolved, I Mayor Fournier and the members of the Royal Oak City Commission hereby proclaim September 2023 as Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month and we'll join Tye Michigan Teal with communities across the state and we'll have teal ribbons tied on trees and signposts and informational cards distributed to local businesses and offices to raise awareness of ovarian cancer and its symptoms.

RO_08_14_23,SPEAKER_17,"Mr. Mayor, members of commission, thank you for having us here this evening and I want to add some context because in my first four years in the legislature, not only as a Royal Oaker but as a member of the minority that was apparently enemy number one for our colleagues on the other side of the aisle,  It felt like for the first four years we sent our requests in for Royal Oak and for our district into the abyss and usually got nothing except for the World War II memorial that we celebrated with Representative Ellison just recently. But it's truly been an honor to now be a member of not only majority but taking a seat on the Appropriations Committee. It's a very different experience.  you know, we went in with the goal of making sure that we were able to deliver for every single community that we represent. And when I got together with my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee in the Senate, we tallied up all of the requests just from the Democratic caucus. And if we were to have fulfilled all of them, it would have been six times the total budget. So we couldn't do that, but we were able to deliver in significant ways, meaningful ways, for every single one of our communities.  This investment pales in comparison to what I've been able to do representing Royal Oak for the first four years. So it's a step in the right direction and the first of many with all of the exciting things that we have happening downtown. You probably see Noah and me running up and down the hill. It's amazing to see it now blooming with trees and plants. It's just a community that I couldn't imagine living anywhere else. And we know that this is going to encourage more people to come downtown to park  our least favorite subject but one that is very important to do so safely to be able to access the garages and support all of our amazing small businesses, our public spaces and continue to grow the community. So thank you and thank you for being active participants in the process letting us know what you need. We keep our lists constantly updated. I know Paul's not going to let anything go without us knowing about it so we're confident this is like I said just the first step of many more success stories to come.",2099.0,2228.0,"""""",Other,Other,0,0

RO_08_14_23,SPEAKER_01,"Thank you, Mayor. Bill Harrison, Royal Oak. 82 years here. A potpourri of comments, and then based on what I just heard about this proposed parking structure, I have a lot to say. First of all, Paroosh Park. Renaming the park in recognition of Pat is definitely appropriate.  Pat and Dave are friends and former Woodward side subdivision neighbors. You may not always agree with Pat, but she is always prepared. On the Hamer Park, will the improvements include a traditional historical marker that tells their story? This is what I proposed almost two years ago that got this ball rolling.  And I'm getting shakes of heads forward. Okay. It's the story that's important. All right. The MPS parking. I have a question as to what the data analysis shows due to the increase in grace period and maximum stay for April through June.  Basically, why don't we just cut through it and eliminate the back in parking on Washington and provide conventional or civic smart meters as are used in Birmingham. Now, this $600,000 check for parking deck is a drop in the bucket for first of all. Can you tell me where you're going to put this parking structure?  The reason I ask is the master plan is proposing building on the 6th and Main Street lot. That lot is important because there's a lot of people that won't park in a parking deck and that lot is consistently loaded. When I was on the DDA I was responsible for obtaining that property from Frisard. It was their bump shop.  so I feel a little bit paternalistic toward it. As far as another parking deck is concerned, we don't need it. The existing parking decks are underutilized. My understanding is that you're having problems paying the debt service on the parking decks and why are we building another parking deck? It doesn't make a damn bit of sense.  Now, I've got 21 seconds left, that's why I said I'm throwing this away. But I wish you'd tell me where are you going to put another parking deck?

RO_08_14_23,SPEAKER_16,"Alan Ashley, Royal Oak Manor. I'm going to talk about number 14 and number 15. First of all the terms of standing is great but it's still not going to do the job. Those back in parking are keeping people away. Most people can't bar back into parking lot if cars are on both sides.  You can program them just like you do P7 lot, which is across from Royal Manor and right next to 536, that bar over there in the corner in Buffalo Wild Wings. Those are all kiosks. You put your darn license plate number in, boom, it's taken care of. Simple as that. On the streets, if the people go in head first, put the license plate number in, So all you got to do is if they head in parking, have them put their license plate number. When they back out, it's done. And this other thing on number 15, rank choice voting.  I kind of did a little research and I got the pros and cons. The pros, it determines the candidate with the strongest support wins. It encouraged civil campaigning. That means you people will have to go to everybody in the city road and not your favorite little clique groups.  reduce wasted votes, and need for multiple elections. The cons, too complicated. You expect senior citizens and people to figure out how to do rank choice voting. It's expensive. Two, the person with the most votes may not win.  If you check it closely, people with the second or third place may have more votes than the first place votes because you didn't get 50%. Your vote may not count, it'll be exhausted. In other words, if a 5% got your vote, your vote is thrown out automatically. So anybody that votes for that person, they didn't count. It delays the results.  The results will be, hey, two, three days. And it violates our constitutional right of one person, one vote. Of all the states, 50 states, 30 states don't have it. 12 states have it for only local elections, and those are the far left.  Six for military and overseas. One bans it all together, which is Florida. 30 states don't have it. Seems to me that most of this country does not like rank voting. So I think you people will be making a bad choice.

And I hate feeling that I need to be calling the police all the time from just living downtown. The number of smaller crimes I see committed, but as we all know, the multitude  it creates a dangerous situation. I've had multiple situations where either me or my friends when in a crosswalk would have a car come right up to us like within millimeters. Just even on the way here walking here I saw a very aggressive driver who was making a left turn and seeing that I was making the the cross just went ahead anyways and gunned it through.  And so I've been noticing a lot of this activity. I know that resources to police it are limited, so I don't hold law enforcement responsible in any way. I know they do what they can.  I think we might want to look at some measures to kind of do some more remote policing. For example, sometimes I park in the garage at 6th and Lafayette and sometimes I see things in there that aren't necessarily going to rise to the level of a police response or an arrest but it's just kind of just unlawful activity. For example, a couple weeks ago I was driving south on Lafayette trying to get to the garage  There was a car with its hazards on, a whole bunch of people milling around it and I was like waiting there and they're telling me to go around and my issue is I've been burned lately by some reckless drivers and I want to be careful. I don't just want to go out into that middle lane that's there for a turn when somebody else expects  to be able to use that lane. So it seems maybe kind of common sense that you just go around, but I didn't want to. I'm like, I'll wait for you guys. I'll wait for you guys. And they got frustrated with me. And those are the kind of situations I'm constantly finding myself in downtown. Also, I know the bullet's in the chamber, but arts beats and eats. I love it. I love it. I love it. I love it. I want to stay in Royal Oak, but  I think we need to deemphasize carnival rides as one of the types of attractions at the thing. I'm a marijuana user and I think we should have no such marijuana advertising whatsoever in that district. It's not for kids. And kids are there. And it just doesn't need to be there.

I know there's been  A lot of discussion and a lot of things taking place in a very short period of time. I know we'll have some discussion on this, but I'm going to have Ms. Davids kick it off here, Mr. Filipsky, and tell us a little bit more about what the Naming Commission came back with and where we stand today.",3293.0,3397.0,Comments - Out of ,Public Comment,Government,0,0
RO_08_14_23,SPEAKER_02,"I would be very honored to do that. First of all, Commissioner Parush is watching from home so we can all wave into the cameras.  All right, very good. So the Naming Committee respectfully submits its recommendation to rename Waterworks Park to Patricia Paroosh Park. I think Commissioner Hunt did a beautiful job of describing all of Commissioner Paroosh's marvelous attributes, but I'll just give you a little bit of background history. So in 1979, at age 28, she first made her first foray into politics by announcing her campaign for City Commission.  And no one knew that this ambitious candidate would achieve groundbreaking success in Royal Oak's political landscape. In her very first election, she left everyone astonished. She topped all candidates for commissioner in her race, securing the most votes.  By 1983, she'd earned the position of Mayor Pro Tem, and then in 1989, after serving on the commission for 10 years, she decided to pursue the office of the Mayor seat, and she won by a landslide, and she was just 38 years old. Her victory was described as extraordinary by the Daily Tribune, and she won all but two precincts in the city, so her appeal truly  is universal. As mayor, she championed recycling programs, she advocated for alternatives to trash landfills, she prioritized preserving residential neighborhoods, and her support for strong business community was evident by her voting record.  After she completed her second term, she made the difficult decision to step down. She just completed her law degree at Wayne State Law School and decided to pursue her chosen vocation and stepped aside from politics.  briefly. Then just about two decades later she made a return to politics when in 2014 the Royal Oak City Commission unanimously appointed her to fill a vacancy. And what was intended to be just a one-year commitment resulted in nearly another decade of service.  And today, Commissioner Peruse holds many records. She is the youngest woman to ever be elected and to serve. And she's also the oldest woman to be elected and to have served. And she boasts the title of the longest serving female elected official in our city. She's been serving the residents of Royal Oak for a third of her life. Her tenure is 23 years.  So the naming committee recognizes Commissioner Peruzza's accomplishments, her intelligence, her dedication to our community, and the trust we place in her is well-founded. So based on the criteria established in the Royal Oak Municipal Code, which states the rules that apply when naming something for somebody,  The Naming Committee believes that she embodies the requirement of being a person of good character, one who has contributed to the advancement of our city, and somebody who definitely is historically significant. The Naming Committee believes that she's well-deserved of this recognition. Do you have anything to add?",3397.0,3620.0,"""""",Other,Other,0,0
RO_08_14_23,SPEAKER_15,"So Waterworks Park as you may know is a six acre park located very centrally in the city.  And for obvious reasons, I think that would be a great location for this. There's work that can be programmed in there, I think, as part of this as well. The master plan requires or suggests that we redevelop the storage area that was existing. That work is underway currently. And really, the only other thing that this park calls for is tree plantings and sort of making it more of a passive area in the center. So I just wanted to add that.  along with this naming that you know we have the services of a company that can help us in coming up with conceptual plans should we decide to do anything in addition to naming the park.

For those of you who know Pat, we don't have to explain anything here.

I mean, you've been working with Commissioner Krusch, and a lot of thought has gone into the selection of this particular park and the appropriate way to  honor someone with such a such a long tenure of service to this city. This is a recognition that is deserved of someone like Ms. Davis said with a third of her life devoted to the residents of Burloak. This is quite the accomplishment and dedication that it's hard to even fathom today. I mean  Pat has, Commissioner Parish has put so much time and energy and just a love and passion into this community. I think that's evident, you know, she stepped aside for 20 years and then 20 years later when there was an opening, the name that best popped up to continue to serve the city was someone who has been out of politics for two decades.  But she didn't go away. She was involved in the community. She was out there advocating for everyone and working in service organizations.  it wasn't about sitting at the table making the decisions, it was about making the community a better place. And what better honor to bestow on someone who has been continuously out there just for the sake of making the community a better place. So we can all only hope to be a fraction as good as Pat has ever been.  And as a politician, she is better than all of us. I don't know if Pat has lost more than one vote at this table. She is. When Pat speaks, you know, it's a great position to be from. And you're probably wrong if you're against what Pat's saying. I've gone home sometimes really second-guessing myself and the choices I've made when I'm not in agreement with Pat Parooj.  But that's because of the time and the analytics she puts behind something. Pat spends so much, I'm sorry, Commissioner Paroosh spends so much time just coming about it and looking at all angles. And that's what has made her such a force over the last, you know,  Yeah, five decades since 1979. I mean, that is astonishing to think about. So, you know, once again, thank you to staff. Thank you, Mr. Mayor, for the energy and the thought you've put into this, because I know you've been driving, you know, driving this process. Thank you to the naming committee for meeting very hastily and considering this so we can complete this this month. And then, you know, I'll just close by saying thank you to Commissioner Paroosh.

She didn't become a politician because she wanted to be powerful or well-liked or the most important person in the room. She did it because she's a wife and a mom and now a grandmother who cares about her communities so deeply. And you can see that in every decision she makes. And that's what we've been talking about up here is that she's incredibly thoughtful.  And so smart. And the way that she looks at these problems, she looks at it like with this amazing lens. She can see it from the point of view of the city staff and what they will have to do. She can see it from the point of view of the elected officials and how we have to present it. And she can see it from the point of view of all the residents and what they want. And she's just so in tune. She's just an amazing, a marvelous human being.  And there's just not that many people that you can say are pillars of the community. And she really is. She's a pillar of this community. And we're so lucky, not just us up here, maybe us most of all.  But everyone knows her. Mr. Harrison said it as well. Too often we disagree, but even he recognizes that this is someone who's been so important to the community. And he feels it the same way too, because she really has that ability to connect with everyone. She's amazing and wonderful. And we knew we were gonna be not have her with us at this table this November.  And so I'm so glad that we have the chance right now to say Paroosh Park is going to be here.  I had the pleasure this weekend of saying it to someone already, because someone was mentioning they're getting rid of the storage at Waterworks Park. And I said, you mean Paroosh Park? It's gonna be happening on Tuesday. I'm so much looking forward to that and to what it's going to bring.

You look at the things we see around us, our downtown, she's one of the driving forces. Our downtown defines our city. And the use of tax increment financing, we were pioneers in that. And she was a pioneer in leading that effort. And look how that has changed our city and made us the envy.  really, of cities around Michigan. So as others have said here, she was smart, she was prescient, she was a good politician, and she gave us a future that we could not have imagined without her.  I will say personally, she was my counselor. And whenever I was getting ready to do something rash or crazy, I'd call her to talk me down. And sometimes she would, and then sometimes she'd just give me a little push in the back and tell me to jump. And I think she enjoyed the mischief that perhaps she was sending out into the community.  She's never thought of herself as a social media person, and yet I think everything she did for Centennial Commons, I mean, she was a champion of that park, is the chair of that committee. She wrote Facebook posts and articles and took pictures and really championed that park. And it's her, essentially, more than anybody else that made it the success that everyone acknowledges.

And this purchase agreement is for sort of the  the focus of the park which is a what's called a heroic scale bus. So heroic scale is one and a half times life size of Elizabeth Hamer. The cost of the artwork is $32,000 and I'd like to clarify that $15,000 of that is what goes to the artist to create the piece of work and we've raised that money to cover that expense.  The remainder of it goes to a foundry to actually pour the work and the cost of bronze and whatever that entails. I had the opportunity to talk to Mr. Brantley before this meeting. He wished he could be here, but he's just super busy. But he was telling me that he will more than likely complete his part in the fall. But then once the work is done, it takes,  now in the hands of the foundry and he doesn't really control like how fast it moves along. But under this agreement he would complete the work within 42 weeks and as I said he's confident that he'll have something ready for people to see this fall.  The artist will also aid installing the piece on the city property, and the city will be responsible for maintaining it. It's important to know that the Royal Oak Commission for the Arts reviewed Mr. Brantley's contract and they endorsed it. And just a word about Austin. He is  Very accomplished, very renowned sculpture. And you can actually see his work in Berkeley. He's a Berkeley High graduate and he has a piece that they just unveiled in Berkeley this last month. I should also mention that, I forgot to mention, that the city was recently granted $50,000 from the Oakland County Parks Community Grant Program, which helps pay for some of the construction costs  And there's a picnic area, there's accessible pathways, and we can use some of that money to cover the cost of the foundry work. The artist's work is done with donations. And finally, just,  Just the significance of this sculpture can't be overstated. It will be the first work of art in Royal Oak to recognize a member of a black pioneer family.

RO_08_14_23,SPEAKER_15,"Good evening Mayor Fournier, City Commissioners. The item before you as noted is a request from the Department of Public Services to fill three vacancies, two of which were vacated due to a retirement and a promotion, the paint machine operator and a water maintenance worker too. The third position, the operations manager, is the new position that was discussed during budget time and approved as part of the budget.  And just a couple points on that position, specifically being that it's a new position. I have included a brief summary of the tasks associated with that job in my report.  But in general terms, that position would be responsible for kind of overseeing the routine daily parts of the DPS operations, including with all of the special events and things that we do. There's a lot of coordination of resources among our various divisions and other city departments to actually get the boots on the ground and get the things done. And so having some assistance there I think would  go a long way in terms of improving our operations. They would coordinate some of the legwork as well that's related to a lot of the hiring that we do year-round with seasonals and things associated that sort of assist in some of the administrative duties. And you know within the DPS structure there's a noticeable absence of designated kind of operation specific positions so that's what this would fill.  Those duties are currently being sort of informally handled by a number of individuals sort of outside of their current job descriptions.  And so, you know, if this is approved tonight, the organizational shift would help orient us, I believe, to achieving more efficient and responsive operations, ultimately improving customer service delivery. And the more balanced spread of these assigned functions, the more appropriate spread of that would allow for more attention on longer term strategic planning and process and policy improvements, which are still goals that we have within the Department of Public Services.

For a little bit of background, I know the commission is very aware that this was an initiatory petition, so a signatory petition that was filed with the clerk's office that contained more than the necessary 5% of the voting public signatures to be required to be placed on the city's November ballot.  As this commission is where the entire purpose of an initiatory petition is to take the legislative body being this commission out of the out of the decision making process as far as what legislation is presented to the voters for consideration. So but state law still.  this commission a duty. Once the such a petition is received. By that individual.  body or individual group filing that petition. State law still requires us to transmit a copy of that proposed petition and the resolution to the governor's office and the AG for their review, publish the text of the charter amendment in accordance with state law, place it on the ballot for the November election,  and provide the ballot language that shall be placed on the ballot. We're suggesting in the resolution accomplishes those four requirements that the Home Rule City Act requires of the city to do and that the, sorry, I was trying to find my, I lost my place.  that the ballot language itself is taken directly from the petition and that this commission had no part in drafting any of the ballot language and so that will be what is proposed for the ballot language for the ballot which will again go to the governor's office and the AG's office and interestingly to note that because this is an initiatory petition  even if the governor's office and the AG objected to it, or even if this body objected to it, it would still be required to be placed on the ballot.

We will have an opportunity to provide an impartial statement for any proposal on the city's ballot which will be prepared and sent out to the voters. Trying to explain ranked choice voting is not an easy chore but it's clear that presently state law does not provide for or allow and actually conflicts  with rank choice voting and until such time, if ever, that state law changes, we, the city, if adopted by the voters, and again this will go to the voters to determine whether or not they want to see this charter provision adopted or not,  But if it adopted, unless state law changes and unless the voting equipment is even available and even purchased by the city and approved by the city's election commission, will this actually go into effect in the city? So a lot of things  would have to happen even if this were to be voted in as a valid charter revision or amendment, it would not necessarily take effect unless significant changes at the state law level change.

Today was the start of a fresh school year here in Rural Oak. You could feel the sense of optimism for the future in the area. As students are finding their seats, it's nearly impossible not to even envision among us that there's a future leader who is in those classrooms today.

I have a lot of paperwork on my desk right now. If you bear with me for one second, I have to get a little organized.  I know, I think Mayor Laney had this well more organized than I did. All right, next on the agenda tonight is to read two proclamations. The first is a proclamation designating September 2023 National Recovery Month. And the second is a proclamation designating September 2023 National Suicide Prevention Month. And I believe Marissa Rose of the Oakland County Health Network is here with us today. So I'm gonna come on down and  Thank you for being here tonight and accepting these proclamations and thank you for all the work that you do. Thank you so much. We'll see if I can get this to work.

Whereas according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, in 2021, 16.5% of Americans, that's 46.3 million people, 12 years or older, were classified as having a substance use disorder in the past year, including 29.5 million people who were classified as having an alcohol use disorder and 24 million people who were classified as having a drug use disorder.  And whereas according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, over 105,000 overdose deaths occurred in the United States in 2022, a 2% decrease from 2021. And whereas substance use recovery is important for individual well-being and vitality, as well as for families, friends, communities, and businesses.  Whereas the Oakland Community Health Network continues to educate and raise awareness of risk and potential harm associated with prescription drug misuse, whereas stigma and stereotypes associated with substance abuse use disorders often keep people from seeking treatment that could improve their quality of life, and whereas substance use disorders occur  when the recurrent use of alcohol and or other drugs cause clinically or functionally significant impairment such as health problems, disability, and failure to meet major responsibilities at work, school, or home. And whereas substance use disorder recovery is a journey of healing and transformation enabling people to live in a community of their choice while striving to achieve their full potential.  And whereas substance use disorder recovery benefits individuals with substance use disorders by focusing on their abilities to live, work, learn, and fully participate and contribute to society that enriches the community culture.  Now therefore be resolved, I, Mayor Fournier, and the members of the Royal Oak City Commission hereby proclaim September 2023 as National Recovery Month in Royal Oak and call upon individuals, public and private institutions, businesses, faith-based organizations, and schools to recommit our state to increasing awareness and understanding of substance use and the need for appropriate and accessible services to promote recovery.

RO_08_28_23,SPEAKER_26,"All right. Item number six on tonight's agenda is going to be a tough one. It wasn't too long ago that we learned of  Commissioner Paroosh's illness and it was even a shorter period of time when we learned about how severe and problematic that illness was. Commissioner Paroosh, I think all of you in this room heard, passed away. Which was also the timing of that  kind of a shock. We knew that inevitably her battle with their illness would be a strong one, a tough one, but ultimately she succumbed to the illness after a tough fight sooner than we even expected. We all had a chance to see her a couple weeks ago and remarkably even in her battled condition she was  comforting to us. She was alert and joking and giving us advice and telling us stories and being pat all the way to the end. Tonight we wanted to take an opportunity not just to mourn the loss of a good friend, colleague,  mentor, and seasoned public servant. It would also take a moment to celebrate who Pat was, who she is, her accomplishments, some of our memories about Pat, and celebrate everything of who she is. I warn you this is going to be challenging tonight. I think all of us up here  We're pretty close to Pat. For most of you, you see us up here twice a month in our sport coats and whatever else we wear up here and dealing with agenda items and public comment. But there's a lot of time that we spend consulting each other, talking to each other as friends. And Pat, you have a functional commission up here because of the leadership of Pat, because of what she brought to the table.  There's a lot of things that folks in the public don't always see, a lot of leadership you don't always see on display that happens, and a lot of kindness and camaraderie among commissioners. We may not always agree, we may be on the other end of votes, not looking at you two in particular, although that's probably factually true.  But we all respect and appreciate and love each other up here and have a fondness for each other.

Personally to me,  You know, Pat has always been a mentor on this commission and it goes back even before I was appointed. You know, Pat and I share, she had multiple sclerosis, which I also have.  And she sat down with me a couple years ago and just talked about the disease and how that impacts someone in a public position and how that impacts your body and ways to kind of make sure you're managing well. And she's always concerned about me and asking how I was doing. And I'm perfectly fine. Also, I'm very lucky. But Pat was always  we share that bond together. I was always inspired by her. She, a handful of years ago, after her 2019 election, sent me a little note just to say thank you. I'm sure she sent hundreds of those notes out, but it's just such a, it made you, she had that connection with people. She was just such a class act like that. I was reading a paper  from 1991, when she was mayor of Paroosh. And it was talking about how she was winding down, and she had just finished law school, and she was clerking for Oakland County. And they asked her, why'd you go to law school? And the answer was, you know, my civic service won't last forever. I've got to figure out something else to do. Well, that was 30-some years ago, and she definitely put in a lot more work after that.  You know, we had a wonderful opportunity two weeks ago to share so many fond memories of Pat, and I think we're all just incredibly lucky that we're able to share that, and she heard it, and I know she appreciated it. She appreciated it so much. So, so much has said that, and I just, I'm always reluctant to fact  that Pat was always right. Even when she wasn't, she was. There's just no way around it. But beyond that, like Melanie said two weeks ago, she was the best of us.  Pat always had such a concise view on the world and how to do things the right way. So if any of us can do stuff a fraction of the way she did, we're gonna be lucky. So I'm blessed to have had these handful of years with her. This city is beyond lucky to have had her for the better part of a quarter century. So yeah, we're just amazingly lucky and my God, will she be missed.",2219.731,2395.653,"""""",Other,Other,0,0
RO_08_28_23,SPEAKER_26,"I'd like to take a moment to read what we're giving our memories. There are a few former commissioners and mayors that also left some fond memories of Pat. And so I want to give some light that clearly she touched everybody in this community, whether you know it or not, directly or indirectly, she made a positive difference in your life.  And I think it's especially good to hear from people that, not just the folks up here that served with her, but also from others that served with her in the past in many different capacities. This one's from Jerry Boylan.  Local government and politics are very personal, and emotions can run high as decisions impact residents directly, meaning it's inevitable city commissioners are going to tick off close to half the residents on any given issue. It's not for the weak of heart or stomach. Yet Pat not only signed up for over a decade of service as commissioner and mayor, but she also came back for more later in life.  The true testament of Pat's legacy is she never lost an election, and even if you disagreed with her, it was hard not to respect her. That's extraordinary, particular in today's ugly political environment. I met Pat in 1981 at an orientation for new Royal Oak City commissioners. I somehow managed to win an election for a two-year commission seat, and while I appeared highly confident, it was fake bravado. I had absolutely no idea what I was doing. And then I met Pat.  We were both young, but she had a pre-natural calm about her that gave her gravitas beyond her years. Pat became a mentor, an ally, and a valued true friend in a very short time that resulted in a wonderful roller coaster ride of local politics for the next two years.  Without Pat's wise counsel, it's likely I would have spontaneously combusted more than once. I'll always be grateful for that. And I wasn't alone. She counseled a few generations of local Poles.  We all know Pat was smart as hell, a gifted leader, a master strategist, and a calm voice of reason. Yet I remember her sense of humor as most valuable trait. I sat next to Pat at the commission table, and on the most opportune or inopportune times, she would slip me a note resulting in my barely stifled guffaw.  One particular note said only, clarion number five, an inside joke that made me snort my tea through my nose and slip off my chair, which made her unable to contain her laughter. That's how I know I'm going to remember Pat, laughing and smiling, knowing that while our work was important, perspective was everything.

RO_08_28_23,SPEAKER_26,"This one's from Marie Donegan, former city commissioner, former state rep. When I was appointed to fill the vacant city commission seat in 2017, I was seated right next to Pat Paroosh. What a blessing. She was my guiding star. I talked to her before every meeting because of her counsel, her sage advice, and her common sense. I don't think anyone made a move on the city commission without getting some sort of reaction from Pat first. I met her when she was the mayor.  She came to our church, St. John's Episcopal, to meet with our parishioners for a civic Q&A session. Her public service got better from there. Pat's death is a tremendous loss for Royal Oak, but we are so much better as a community because she was here. I will never forget her. Dave Richards, also a former city commissioner,  I was privileged to be a friend of Pat Paroosh for over 40 years and a colleague for eight years on the Royal Oak City Commission. Pat was a force of nature despite her quiet demeanor and unassuming personality, or maybe because of those traits. With thorough preparation and direct explanation of her point of view, she showed respect for both her colleagues and the Royal Oak community she represented while being a principal voice in the progress of the city.  There is never any doubt that whatever she supported was well thought out and something she believed was in the best interest of Royal Oak. When a difficult issue came before her, she did not back down, but would deal with that issue and do whatever was necessary to resolve it.  The result has been a Royal Oak that we cherish and enjoy. As others have observed, Pat was the rare person who received the respect of many of those who did not agree with her on a particular policy or even her general governing philosophy. Personally, her private life was no different. What you saw is what you got. She and Day raised two wonderful daughters while pursuing high-level legal careers. The loss of Pat Paroosh is a great loss to her family, to myself, to my wife Janet, and a tremendous loss to the city.  of Royal Oak. This one's from Jim Ellison, former mayor.  Pat was my first mentor from the city commission when I first joined the commission in 1991. It was her guidance in these early days that set my philosophy on my style of governing. A strong understanding of governmental functions and a positive demeanor that allowed discourse to be mostly civil. She was a tremendous asset to the city and her longtime involvement with the city. She possesses a strong grasp of history, where we have come from, and a vision of where we could be heading.  I can't say enough about her value to the city of Royal Oak and its residents and business people. Dennis Cowan, former mayor. Integrity, commitment to community, family, these are the hallmarks of Pat Paroosh's life. Royal Oak is better because of her service. May she rest in peace. And Dave Poulton, former city commissioner. When I reflect on a word that most accurately describes Pat Paroosh, it is passion.  What else could it be to drive a person to dedicate so much time and effort to make Royal Oaks such a wonderful community? The City Commission, various boards, committees, clubs, and organizations were all benefactors of her tireless energy, devotion, and hard work. In her roles as both Mayor and City Commissioner, Pat was essential in reshaping our city to one of the most desirable in the state.  Although a lot can be said about Pat's service, what got my attention on a personal level was how she treated everyone with genuine humbleness and kindness. It is a notable trait that Pat uniquely possessed for which she will be remembered. God bless Pat, her family, and all that she accomplished for Royal Oak. And those were the ones that were submitted by tonight.  Everybody has a story about Pat that fits the vein of just those simple remarks offered up by colleagues that she served with.

RO_08_28_23,SPEAKER_25,"I'll give it a try. I tried to speak from the heart last week and that didn't go well. So I will read my thoughts to the best of my ability. So I've had the privilege of serving with Pat on this commission for most of the last decade.  and she was really everything a leader should be. She was compassionate and open-minded and visionary and incomparably knowledgeable. I feel like every time we discussed an issue in detail, I learned from her and it made me better here at the table. She was tenacious and humble and principled and values-driven and she had unquestionable integrity and yes, an easy sense of humor and could make us laugh.  at times when things are really challenging. And one of the things I love most about her is that while she, yes, was absolutely one of the kindest people I've ever met in my life, and she was always happy to take time to answer questions and share her knowledge and perspective with those seeking to understand a decision at the table or the workings of the city in earnest.  She did not suffer fools. And we had to deal with our fair share together over the years, and she never hesitated to passionately, albeit respectfully, speak truth in the face of what was sometimes wild opposition to it. And I think I'll remember her the most for that, that we often let Pat do that heavy lifting when it was time to explain to people, these are the facts of this situation. This is why everything you are spreading is untrue.  And she did it with such eloquence and grace and undeniable respectability that it really, really powered through and left a permanent impact. And that's why Pat is one of the reasons of so many amazing accomplishments we've achieved as a city over the last 10 years.  Very little of it would have happened if she weren't here at the table with us. So I've learned so much from her and I'm forever grateful for her mentorship and her friendship and her time here made us better. Her lifetime of commitment and service to our community has helped make Royal Oak everything that it is today. And her impact will be felt for generations.

RO_08_28_23,SPEAKER_30,"Thank you.  So I think what we're all saying about Pat here today is that she had that quality that your parent has when you're a little kid where you're like, I don't know what I'm doing but there's somebody here who does and she's going to take me by my hand and she's going to do it right. And having that person up here at the table in front of the city  is so important and it feels a little bit like the rug was pulled out from under us that it was gone so fast. So we did all know she wasn't running for re-election, so she wasn't going to be up here come November. But I'm pretty sure that all of us sitting up here were relying on the ability to call her and ask the same questions we've always asked and get the advice about whether or not we should jump and what we should do and hear those reasoned explanations. If you watch these city commission meetings, you've heard them.  We'll all be sitting up here flailing, and Pat has an absolutely full explanation from the historical view to right now of where we've been and where we should be going. And she can lay it out so that everyone understands. If you're on Facebook, you've seen it there too. She goes and explains the issues that are confounding residents in a way that everyone can understand, and she's quite persuasive.  It's just it's hard to believe, as the mayor said at the beginning, because it happened very fast. So I think that's part of what we're feeling up here today is just the speed with which we lost something that was a foundation for us up here.  But it was amazing. Two weeks ago, we named a park, Paroosh Park. That's Waterworks Park is now Paroosh Park. And the next day, we all together went to visit Pat and to talk about the park and about the meeting. And I think, I can't remember who said it, but it was, she was, Pat, in good spirits and talking to us about everything that near and far past and future.  And it's just unbelievable when we hear from all these people who've dealt with her, from us up here. Every time I've gone out this last week, someone has asked me about Pat, which has been great.  And it's just, it's her impact throughout the city. It's not just the things that she did at this table, the things that we all do together, the way that she touched and connected to people. And she was an example for all of us in the way that she entered politics, the way that she cared about her community.  And the way she just lived her life, she was a really good person. And she was a loving and supportive partner to her husband. She was a loving and supportive mother to her children and her grandchildren. And she was at every city event. She did all of the things. But she also was the one who would say, not today, watch my granddaughter.  She was the complete person. She was who you want to be up here as a leader. Someone who loves her family and loves her community and is so smart that you know she's going to do the right thing. So you'll have to give us a little bit of grace because it's hard for this body to think about how it's going to function without that pillar that we are all used to relying on here.  And that's the legacy I think that Pat is leaving, is that not just that she's touched all of the things that we've done in this city, but that she's touched all of us. She's touched the community in so many ways. And if you were to, if you could map out the web of Pat's connections, it would be all over this room and all over the city. It would be something to see. And that's what I hope will continue to pull us together even when she's not here.  And I hope that we will be able to see and honor her family in the future as well.

I first met Pat when I was appointed, and I think she was probably one of the first ones to call me, and we had a very nice, very long conversation. But I actually got the true chance to talk to Pat one-on-one as  not only just commissioners, but as women, as attorneys, as professionals at a conference that we had last year. And she mentioned that she was interested in, or a big part of the Royal Oak Symphony Orchestra, and I mentioned that in high school, I played violin.  And pretty much once a month after that, she would reach out to me and say, have you started taking lessons yet so that you can be a part of the symphony orchestra?

She went and talked to Pat, brokered a deal, and Pat agreed to stay on for, you know, I'll finish out this term. That's fine. I'll help you guys out. I don't mind coming in out of retirement and, you know, just get your stuff straight and find someone else to fill this role. And I think Commissioner Dubuck said it,  you know that was probably the most important and productive decision we ever made as a body at that time was unanimously voting Pat to come in and fill a seat. And you know her being a former mayor  and me being the current mayor, clearly, you know, you think there'd always be an opportunity for, well, I would have done it this way, or I would do it this way. Pat was never like that, never that type of person. She always picked up the phone, and trust me, I called her a lot. And I just, I still hear her voice saying, so here's the deal.  And she would walk through issues and give perspective and help shape my psyche before coming into a meeting. We've had a lot of important decisions that we've had to make as a community here. We've been growing.  doing a lot of things that cities have to do to be vibrant, to be viable, and Pat was on the cutting and leading edge of a lot of it, and her ideas were very contemporary and progressive for the day, and she was always willing to pick up the phone when I called, walk me through things, and I remember on a couple, I remember one occasion, I gotta be careful because it was closed session,  But we were all, there was a potential development deal or some interest that the city would have on a property. And we're talking about, okay, this might work out for the city. This might help solve some issues. We can work on helping out an old abandoned site and figure out some rebirth for it.  And we're all talking and being, you know, the naive visionary people that we were at the time. And Patch just in the corner kind of snickering. And she went through and she found a certain chemical. For those of you who don't know, she was an environmental attorney as her vocation. And she found this chemical that I can't even pronounce. I've barely...  I speak the English language most times and it is my native language. But she called this chemical out and she said, guys, we're not touching this with a 10-foot pole. You know, this is a bad idea. Stay far, far, far, far away from it. And there were small things like that constantly that Pat could bring to the table with her acumen.  in her expertise or her historical perspective but she was also very good helping not just consult us but even for me on big issues that we knew we were going to have a full house in city chambers. We knew that whatever decision we made somebody's going to walk away upset and those are the toughest decisions for us because everyone thinks up here decisions are you know 100 binary, zero, one, yes, no but sometimes it's 51 percent.  you know, in our brain. And 49, you know, because we see both sides. And Pat was very good at, with her experience and just her fact-based approach and her genuine caring approach to say, you know, and organize the, whether you voted with her or not, she would organize everything in a framework that we could actually make productive decisions. And that is going to be something that is,  going to be a huge loss for our community in terms of her service. Pat's approach that I've tried to model as mayor, which I can never live up to, is the great exercise of patience. She never had an ax to grind. She only had a pencil to sharpen.  So when things got tough, she went back and came back with a tremendous amount of research. I remember one time I was opining about Woodward Avenue and like, why are the lots designed like this? What in the heck happened? And Pat's like, oh, I got it.  I got some stuff on that. The very next week she came in with how Woodward had been zoned, documents from the 1920s that she had found and put together, and said, okay, this is why we have the problems on Woodward. And I'm like, nobody has ever presented that, ever. And Pat, within, I'm not sure how long it took her to put it together, but a simple question that we had, she went and did it, took on the initiative, and provided something very, very valuable.  that helped answer a perplexing question of what we were looking at at the time. She was the commissioner, and with no disrespect to my fellow commissioners up here, that you could absolutely trust to put on a topic  Go out, get it done, get it done right, and come back and have something that the community would rally around. Examples I can give, Centennial Commons. She raised her hand right here at this table and said,  I got it. I'm going to take this one. We're going to figure it out. It's really complex. There's a lot of stuff going on. A lot of, you know, you got the development, you got everybody wants something different out of the park. You know, I'm going to volunteer to help bird dog that project from this table.  And she did an absolutely exceptional job. And I think there were some struggles with it, for sure, that we won't talk about, that were mostly fabricated. But she, in the end, found a way forward to bring in so many voices in that process.  to help create what's a world-class park that will be remembered and be here for such a long time. We put her on stormwater management after 2014. I didn't say we put her on, she volunteered. She's like, I got a lot of ideas and I have a lot of legal background on this. Let me see what I can do.  And she has made and made significant strides since then to put our city in a position where we've been. I mean, it took 100 years to build the infrastructure here. It's not going to take 100 days to fix. But we have the plans in place now to mitigate stormwater, I think, above and beyond our peers in ways that are really innovative, in ways that are leveraging state statutes and legalities, but also what we're doing from a physical point of view.  to help manage this ever-increasing problem. And so I'll remember, at least here at this table, Pat being the steady foundation of this commission, the 10 years that she was here, the leader, the person always having the answer and always being able to help resolve any sort of conflict, even if it was among commissioners or even if it was with the community.  She was very, very gifted in this regard. I also remember the time where I think Kyle might have been you and I having a beer with her, trying to convince her after we appointed her. We're like, you know, Pat, you should run again. And the energy we saw from her, she said, you know what? It's been a while, but I'm having so much fun up there.  You know, you guys are, you know, we have the opportunity to make some meaningful changes. I just don't want to fill in. Let's go do this. I'm going to run. And even for her second part, her second tour of service to Royal Oak, she was so motivated and so excited and that energy just like lifted us out of the seat at the time. Like, yeah, let's go. You know, what do we have to do? Let's, you know, support you in any way that we can.  just remarkable in almost every aspect, a true example of what it means to be a public servant. I had a friend I read, and he said, after a tragedy in his life, that Pat lived from 1950 to dash 2023.  What do you do with that dash? What do you make of that dash? And in Pat's lifetime, she raised a remarkable family, was an incredible spouse to her husband, and she was a public servant for decades on a couple different tours. She advanced this city in more ways that we can count. You've heard a lot of it here tonight.  And not just in the physical things that we see or the progress that we've seen, but in everything that makes us who we are in terms of our sense of welcomeness, our kindness, our desire to solve problems the right way. Her mark will be here for a very, very, very, very long time in this city. And we are so grateful for her dash and for everything that she leaves us  And our job now is to carry that torch forward as best we can, but in no way like she could. There will be, and I want to make sure everybody is aware, we're going to have an opportunity to more formally memorialize Commissioner Paroosh.  On Thursday, September 7th at 10 a.m. until the time of the memorial there will be a visitation service at the Royal Oak Farmers Market which is right here. And the memorial will take place at 11 a.m. The arrangements are going to be with William Sullivan and Son Funeral Home. Pat is also  And her family requested if you're considering any sort of flowers or contributions or anything that, you know, their family's desire and her desire were to the Royal Oak Symphony Orchestra and the Royal Oak Civic Foundation, which were two causes that she was passionate about. And I hope to see you all there at the memorial. I think we all owe Pat a tremendous amount of gratitude  And this will be a good opportunity for the community to say goodbye to Pat, but also show how much she meant to us and let her family know how much she meant to us. So, I'm not sure if anybody else has anything else they want to share tonight. It's a very challenging deed.  And I appreciate everybody's willingness to hear us talk about Pat. And I think I look out here and I see probably many of you know her and know of her and probably met her in your lifetime as well. It's a true loss for the city and it's a true loss for each of us up here. We lost a good friend. So we appreciate your patience and understanding as we try to move on.  If you're listening, you can hear us, we love ya, we miss ya, we're not gonna forget ya, and we're gonna, we appreciate everything you instilled in us. Thank you.

First, I wanted to just express my condolences and thank you for sharing such incredible memories and just what a very moving tribute. So, thank you for that.  So, I wanted to come and just briefly say hello and share a couple of updates. I think I probably chose the best council meeting to come to. One, to hear this moving tribute. Also, there's a leprechaun and there's going to be talk about environmental legislation. So, perfect fit. Really happy to be here. Some of you may know I serve a really interesting district that does include one precinct in Royal Oak.  the very northeast precinct, Precinct 19, and so I am really glad to be here. I really want to do a couple things. One, to remind folks that I'm here and to please definitely feel free to reach out if there's ever anything that I can do to be of service.  and then two just to share very brief updates since I know you've got a lot to cover today. One the legislature as you know we are on a summer recess but before we broke for the summer we did do a lot of good things. I'll just highlight a couple quick things that we did in June. One as your clerk is probably very very aware we spent a good amount of time working on updates to our election law to make sure that we are that we have election laws that match what voters  approved in November with proposal 2. So thank you for the all the great work and input from so many groups and the clerks especially. So for the residents here they may or may not be aware but we're gonna have early voting, we're gonna have a lot of drop boxes, we're gonna have an expanded  set of voter ID that can be accepted, including, and that was actually the bill that I had in the package, including municipal ID, which doesn't apply to Royal Oak, but very important, as well as all forms of student ID, and a number of other really, really important changes. So, excited about those changes that we were able to pass into law.  The other thing you're going to be hearing a lot more of later on today, but we did introduce a great package of bills related to climate action, which I think we are all very acutely aware of due to all of the storms and the heat and the flooding and all of the things that we know are not going away until we take bold action. So very proud to be a supporter.  and co-sponsor on the climate package that will increase our renewable energy standard, ensure greater energy efficiency, give our Public Service Commission greater tools to hold our utilities accountable, and much, much more. So you're going to hear a lot more about that. And I'm excited that you all are taking up a really important resolution on that topic. So great timing. And then two other things that I wanted to just briefly mention.  One of the things that I've worked on for about five years now, and I'm excited that this is the year, hopefully, when we can actually get it done, is work on legislation around protecting domestic violence survivors. So very soon, we'll be reintroducing legislation that's about ensuring that those who are convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence are prohibited from having, purchasing, selling, et cetera, a gun for a period of eight years.  There is already a federal law related to this, but it's really, really important that we give our local law enforcement and prosecutors a tool at the state level. So, I'm really excited about the momentum that we've built on that issue. We will soon be introducing that legislation, and we believe that we have a lot of momentum and support, and we're eager to see that through.  The fourth thing that I'll mention really briefly that Commissioner Dubuck is very aware of is that for about eight years now I've been working on water affordability. And this is an issue that continues to touch the lives of so many Michiganders.  We know from the pandemic how important it is to have access to drinking water and water to wash your hands. And, you know, we've taken some important steps as a state, as a country, to begin to address this issue. But as a state, there's so much more that we can't do. So we're very excited that over the past six months in particular, we've brought together  water providers, environmental advocates, water advocates, MML, SEMCOG, and a lot of organizations that I'm forgetting right now, United Way, community action agencies to actually build out a really comprehensive solution around water affordability. So stay tuned. The work is ongoing, but we hope to introduce that legislation in the coming weeks. And I think we'll make a really, really big impact. So I'm very excited about that.  For those who are watching or here in the room, please feel free to contact us. My office district phone number is 313-922-6949. I also have a couple of things that I'll figure out. I'll probably place them near the front if folks want to grab them on the way out. One is just a little survey.  and our contact information, and then my latest newsletter, which is about the environment. So again, perfect timing. Thank you for your public service. The work that you all do at the city level is so, so important. And I'm really inspired just hearing all of the memories that you've shared about your colleague, and also really inspired by all the great work that you have continued to do.

Just a few quick remarks before we start public comment. The City Commission values and relies on the input of our fellow citizens to help make decisions. Now is the time set aside for the public to address the City Commission on any related topic or unrelated topic, whether it's on the agenda or not. I ask that comments be directed to the City Commission as a whole and not to individual commissioners.  In addition to the public comment, there will be a public hearing at tonight's meeting. If you're here to comment on the public hearing on the necessity special assessment paving a Massoy Road, you can wait till that time to give your public comment and enter it into the record with the hearing.  If you wish to speak tonight at either public comment or regarding the public hearing, please wait till you're recognized by me, the mayor, and come up to the podium. For the record, we'll ask you to state your name and address. Please be mindful that the City Commission wants to hear from anyone who wishes to speak tonight, so comments are limited to three minutes.  per speaker, not per topic. With the exception of the public hearing, which if you speak at public comment about something in general, and then you want to speak at the public hearing about the paving, you can speak twice, no problem.

There are other ways to reach out to us, like email, at the grocery store, walking our dogs. We're here to serve, so whenever you find an appropriate time to reach out to us, please don't hesitate. Please note that we typically don't respond directly to questions during public comment. However, we are taking notes and we'll address those questions when the topic is discussed.

RO_08_28_23,SPEAKER_33,"Well, public service, all right.  The resident I'm representing is Linda Manning Myatt. She's lived in Royal Oak for 12 years. She told me recently that she, instead of an $85.50 water bill, and I have copies of those from December and March,  She had a visit from one of the DPW people, which is to his credit, because he came out before she got the last bill, because it was so high. Instead of 85.50, it was going to be $2,073.85. He came out to warn her of this high bill, and she asked him to look at the meters. He said the meter in the basement was not moving.  And so she had no time before the bill came out to get any repairs done because she didn't expect this bill to be that high. She has since then had two of us friends read the meter because she can't make it down the basement steps. And instead of 155 hectocubic feet,  It's only been two hecto cubic feet in the last 43 days. So there is definitely a problem somewhere. One of the things she saw on next door is someone said that they saw construction people making use of a resident's outdoor faucet and there was construction on her street.  And so that may be where some of that water came and went from. She heard no signs in her house that there was any kind of leak or water usage.

I'm here tonight to, I'm the petitioner for a citizens traffic committee item 6B and 6C, which come up tonight on item 11.  So on your printouts that you'll get in a second, you're going to see a map on the first page and a couple notes you can refer to on the later pages and pictures when this item comes up.  The ask that I have for you all tonight is pretty simple. For item 6B, we'd like to add signpost reflectors to the seven stop signs on or bordering the former truck route to increase awareness and visibility of these stop signs, all of which are but a crosswalk, so we think it'll improve pedestrian safety and help drivers see these signs at night.  I personally think the signpost reflectors are great. As you can see on the second page, it's a relatively simple way to let drivers know and draw their attention to the traffic sign at hand. The signpost reflector carries the same color of the sign down the post. So again, it just makes it easier to see.  So again, those examples are also included on that second page, and then the requested stop signs are also shown there on the latter pages. So it is noted that three of those stop signs are actually about 20 years old, so I was hoping Engineer Donahue was here tonight so we'd get a laugh about that, because those are always kind of goofy. So hopefully those can get replaced as well.  I'll keep my comments relatively brief. Again, just asking the commission to consider amending item 6B tonight with those seven stop signs under consideration to add those signpost reflectors to those and to accept the staff recommendation on item 6C. Thank you very much for your time. And I appreciate the sentiments about the former commissioner. I didn't get the chance to meet her or know her, but I was looking forward to  being a part of that journey of discovering who she was.

RO_08_28_23,SPEAKER_18,"I just want to give you those video guys from our quick Royal Oak Leprechauns summer season. Mark Sackett, General Manager of Royal Oak Leprechauns. Appreciate you taking the time and condolences also for Commissioner Paroosh. I think I read a quote about her saying business over residence and she never chose business over residence or residence over business. She was about the community.  So I thought that was a good segue for what we're doing at Memorial Park as a nonprofit corporation and trying to bring people here and share and build for the community. Real quick recap of our leprechaun season. We started off with bringing in high school teams from country day to Oxford, which was a great first game that where country day won on a walk-off double.  And then Birmingham Grows and Birmingham Seaholm played at Memorial Park. And that was a 2-1 rain to shorten game, but it was a great, great fight there. We saw Rochester College bring in U of M, Dearborn, Cornerstone University, Cleary University, and even Concordia University.  So the field, the park, it's really getting noticed. It's filling up. I would think that Mr. Vidali will tell you that the numbers of these rentals are going crazy over there, which is great to see. The field is great. Our leprechaun season allowed us to squeeze in 26 home games from early June to late July.  This year we opened the park to allow the ROSL to play during our games in one of the other, the youth fields. And that seemed to work pretty well, allowing them to play more games there as well. Overall, our attendance and our sales were up this season. Our kids club grew. Our name became more recognizable in the community.  Our first three games of the year, we had a ton of elementary kids there. We had over 1,500 kids show up in three days, and that park was packed, and those kids were screaming, and the teachers loved it, because they weren't in their classroom with them. So it was a great kickoff to our season. It was great seeing all these kids, and they're all wearing their leprechaun shirts, the Royal Oak leprechaun shirts, which was great.  Last week we met with the president and founder of a higher level league. It's called the Northwoods League. That league is a higher level league. It's a step below minor league baseball.  They really liked what we are doing at Memorial Park. The Northwoods League has games on ESPN Plus and ESPNU. They bring kids in from all over the country. The Northwoods League is a league that hosts the Traverse City Pit Spitters, what we're most familiar with. Kalamazoo Growlers, Battle Creek, Battle Cats. So that's the league we're looking to jump into. If we did that, we'd have 36 home games. Again, we'd be bringing a lot more activity to that park.  So we're hoping to do that. It would be amazing for the leprechauns. It would be amazing for this community to see some real over with there. The only thing that's holding us back is our facilities. And we just need to try to get some improvements, some facilities, and some people are gonna be talking about that.

RO_08_28_23,SPEAKER_05,"Evening, Patrick McGee, 4524 Elmhurst Avenue. As many of you may or may not know, I'm very vocal in letting you guys know what I think, and I've done that with Pat in the past. And I just wanted to share one thing about my many emails to her. She, when we were trying to prevent the paving of parking spots in Delamere, she emailed me back and said, Mr. McGee, you're absolutely right.  And I love that email because she pointed out all these facts about Delamere and how it was once green and then it was paved and now go back to green. And so I appreciate that. She was very kind and always took the time to email me even when we disagreed. So very nice. But what I'm up here to talk to you guys about tonight traffic committee item 1160. There's no turn on red sign currently going from southbound Delamere on to  westbound Normandy. I'd like that sign to be removed. This goes against what the traffic committee is recommending with you guys. My reasons for this is about a year ago you guys approved traffic calming as well as some other traffic mitigation stuff on Normandy to help lower the speed. And two, it's fitting with tonight's agenda topics,  the environmental impact of removing this is pretty high. So in my professional job, I do a lot with fuel economy. And one of those things is you burn a lot of fuel just sitting around doing nothing. So if we can prevent that by getting the cars to turn right without having to sit at a light,  It's better for the environment. It's about half as much CO2 reduction as you would get without that sign. So the key is get rid of that sign. Reduce your CO2. Reduce your formaldehyde. Reduce your hydrocarbons. It's great for the environment. There's really no reason to have it there. There's no traffic, or excuse me, there's no pedestrian, there's no crosswalk there. So it's a win-win for everybody.

RO_08_28_23,SPEAKER_22,"No jokes, don't worry. Extra 30 seconds for Pat, please. I had the pleasure of meeting Pat. First time I met her was at Jim Reznor's house at a party. I was standing with her and Jim Ellison, and I remember sharing a joke about, there was an issue about having a bar within 500 feet of a church or a school, and I said, huh, I don't want churches or schools within 500 feet of a bar.  Okay, right off the top, all Royal Oak residents should have free admission to Art Speeds and Eats. I strongly feel that way. I don't think they'd be giving up that much revenue by allowing that and I think it's fair for  residents as far as loss of use and the effective traffic it has on other people trying to get to work. It screws up rideshare demand, makes it expensive for people to get to work. Also, I don't really like the marijuana stuff either, even though I support its legalization. We have Hazel Park for that. Yeah, there's this guy, Tom Hayden.  He was born here in 1939, December 11th, and he went on to do a lot of amazing stuff. He went to Shrine Elementary School, attended Shrine Church, went to Dondero.  where he serves as editor of the paper in his outgoing address. He used the first letter of every paragraph to spell, go to hell. He was denied his graduation ceremony, but received a diploma anyway. He went on to serve as editor of the Michigan Daily, and then covered race issues for the National Student Press, where he was beaten by white mobs in Mississippi.  I see you have the open carry issues part of your closed session, and I'm not that guy. Don't worry. I don't want to be that guy. But I think it's stupid that I have to wear a wristband. I do. I think I should just be able to show my ID. And furthermore, I don't want any festival security impeding my route to my home under any condition. I don't want them touching me, laying their hands on me.  I'd like to see the city prosecutor prosecute accordingly if that were to happen. If we want to put the power of law behind me just walking into where I live, then there should be police officers stationed at every entrance and exit to the festival for that very purpose.  And yeah, I could have been like, no, I'm not wearing it. Or, you know, screw you. And I think about what would Tom do? Well, Tom would have probably turned the whole thing into a 1968 Democratic Convention. So I'm not going to do that. But I know what at least Tom would have done is come up here and say something about it. So that's what I'm doing. I think it's unnecessary. I think it's an annoyance. I love Arts Beats and Eats. I got the sweatshirt at the very first Arts Beats and Eats that was in Royal Oak.  And in the past few years, I've noticed it changed negatively.

At the same time we're promoting walkability, the drivers are getting terrible. Since 2019, traffic deaths up 50%, bicycle fatalities up 26%, pedestrian fatalities up 18%, alcohol related fatalities up 22%. Michigan just passed the distracted driving on June 30th.  We've got a lot of speeders on this truck route. We had an engineer at Donahue put out a report. So as Chief Moore knows, speeders are more likely to be intoxicated, more aggressive, and they practice poor driving habits. They're more likely to. So at the same time,  traffic's getting worse, drivers are getting worse. We as a city, with our master plan, with where we're going, with our progressive principles, we're promoting more walking, jogging, bicycling, walking, strolling. And our area has a lot of great investment, and a lot of more folks, a lot of kids, and multifamily, and the great park, of course.  What we need is the modernization of the old truck route. So, almost nothing has been happening, or nothing has really physically changed with that route since I've been living there for 34 years. So, we need to improve pedestrian safety, we need to calm the traffic, and we need more signage, more awareness.  for entering a residential area, combined single-family, multifamily, with a flood freeway system that has loads and unloads on a road like Mohawk. So it's been a problem for years. So what we're doing now is we're trying to get calming and traffic safety for that piece. So that piece  is the truck route in the yellow. We're looking, as Chris and Sue talked about, we're looking for crosswalks with signage at these two locations, entering the residential area from where the dispensary is going to be, and then entering and leaving where the freeway is through a residential area. And quickly, here's a little mock-up, but I've been studying crosswalks, often a worn-out  then they disappear off in snow covered. So what we have some of these but you wouldn't know it. So what we're asking for is to do something like this to give us the fluorescent and the big science and really slow down the folks. So that's item number 11.

Just before I started, I didn't know if you guys knew, if you all knew what the country that has the fastest growing capital in the world is Ireland. It's Dublin every day.

Getting rid of the bleachers. I mean, you've had the program for a while, and it's successful. You've had the facilities there. It's been good. You need to upgrade. Difficult to see through the fencing sometimes, the scoreboard. There needs to be a warning track out in the fields. As an umpire, I know that warning tracks can provide safety for outfielders.  You could have a bad situation if somebody doesn't have a warning track going back to catch a fly ball. So the bathrooms also need to be improved. You just need to upgrade there.

It's been so special to make these memories with my family. 40 years ago my dad played softball at Memorial Park. Enjoying the games is nostalgic for him and he's of course impressed with how the field's improved so far. A few upgrades to the field would make our experience that much better. The bathroom facility needs to be renovated. Improvements can be made to make it easier to take the kids to the bathroom.  Viewing from the stands is tricky due to the fencing and the angles of the bleachers. Climbing into the stands and the tight space between rows made it difficult for my dad and I to comfortably sit for the game.

RO_08_28_23,SPEAKER_12,"All right. Hello all, my name is Mike Seville. I live at 1105 Ottawa Road, Michigan. I would like the following statements and photos entered into public record. First photo shows the dump contamination at the southwest corners of Ferris Avenue and 1018 Genesee.  The second and third photos show the proper cement washout station to contain cement during the washout, thereby preventing hazardous material from entering the environment.  On 8-21-2023, the City of Royal Oak was present during the pouring of the cement at 1105 Genesee Avenue at the northeast corner of Ferris and Genesee. There is evidence left behind a cement contractor had discharged, cleaned and dumped hazardous cement byproducts upon the dirt portion of Ferris Avenue. Obviously, there was no concern for the environment or the citizens of Royal Oak. Apparently, this had been done under the presence of the on-site supervisor for the City of Royal Oak.  There was no effort made by the contractor or the city of Royal Oak supervisor to follow any type of contained procedure. This gross negligence resulted in endangering the environment and to the residents of Royal Oak. The dump site located at the southwest corner of Ferris and 1018 Genesee Avenue was not more than estimated 20 feet from a Royal Oak drain.  This is the second violation, the first violation happened on July 25th, same location, which resulted in the physical insult by the employee who was employed by the city of Roanoke. This action resulted in physical contact being made by the employee against a local resident. The dumping of cement on 821 at 1018 Genesee Avenue was followed by heavy rain on 823, 2023 through 824, 2023.  The site location used by the cement company to clean their equipment is approximately 20 feet from the storm drain. I was hoping for the past emails to be sent to the Roanoke city manager and the engineering department would correct this and would result in a more favorable outcome. Please review the 2012 and the 2023 Roanoke master plans, referring to sustainability and protecting the environment.  Please refer to an article by the Royal Oak Tribune concerning the city of Royal Oak, Michigan by Mike Connolly from Royal Oak Tribune on May 14th, 2023 at 6.05 AM. In reference to that article, city manager Paul Blake said, Royal Oak's policies are dedicated to practicing the combat climate and changes and protecting the environment.

RO_08_28_23,SPEAKER_36,"comments, but anyways. So good evening, Amanda Herzog, chair of the Environmental Advisory Board, 306 Rhode Island Avenue. As you are aware, on tonight's agenda is a resolution in support of Michigan House and Senate environmental bills adopting the  That's on there. The Environmental Advisory Board is advising the Commission to consider adopting the resolution because the state initiatives align with the goals established by the City Commission to achieve 40% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and achieve net zero by 2050. They also align with the actions outlined in the Sustainability and Climate Action Plan.  and I'm joined here tonight by my board colleagues, Paul Vial and Andrew Sopolis. They have been working closely and vetting out these bills and they can speak to them more specifically. I'm here though to speak on a more personal note. So when I moved to Royal Oak after graduate school, a power outage to me meant drinking the beer in my refrigerator with my husband in the backyard.  When I became a working mom, power outage had me terrified about losing the stock of frozen breast milk in the freezer, risking the flexibility in feeding my children. And now with my children older, I'm concerned for my senior parents and their medications that must remain refrigerated.  There are many more social impacts of power outages that Royal Oakers face. Food insecurities, medical devices, mental health issues, etc. And we in Royal Oak are experiencing frequent power outages. Just last week, Royal Oakers were impacted by the round of storms that happened.  And the frequency and duration of these outages have many concerns. So it's important to invest in resilient systems. So for Royal Oak, safety, public health, and meeting the city's environmental goals depend on it. And these bills will put us on the pathway to a greener, more sustainable future. I just want to make one note, Commissioner Pat Paroosh was an inspiration, and I just want to thank you all for sharing your memories of her.",7821.111,7951.93,"""""",Public Comment,Commenter,1,0

My condolences very heartfelt words that you had to say and I was just thinking this past week. I'm going to take a little side here just because of that. There's a lot of misinformation going around with regards to our master plan.  And I couldn't help but thinking if, you know, if Pat had it in her, we would be ahead of this. Because, you know, I know she stepped up on a number of occasions to, you know, help get the word out, you know, help communicate what needed to be communicated to help us move forward. So I'm right with you in terms of her loss. I'm feeling it too. So thank you.  Yeah, back to the renewable energy. There are seven Senate bills that we want to support and five House bills. So of the seven Senate bills, our Senator Stephanie Chang was a co-sponsor of all seven. So I wanted to acknowledge that.  There are three in particular that I'm going to focus on that I think will most benefit the City of Royal Oak and its sustainability plan. And that's the requiring utilities to have a renewable energy portfolio that has 60% renewable energy by 2030.  2030 and 100% by 2035 in order to meet those greenhouse gas reduction goals. This is absolutely essential that our utilities step up and meet these requirements. Also, another bill addresses energy efficiency that requires our utilities to achieve a 2% or electric utilities achieve at least a 2% annual  Electric energy efficiency requirements. So this is the program that you know, there's rebates and there's things, you know, they have to work with the community. We need this kind of support with going forward and this this mandates this in this.  in one of the bills. And then the last is develop a statewide plan to reduce emissions from heating homes and businesses. I mean, I think this is gonna be the toughest challenge for us as a society. I mean, it would be one thing to produce our electricity from renewable sources, but looking forward, we all heat our houses and buildings with natural gas, and this is gonna be a huge, I mean, I've heard estimates statewide, we're talking 57,  billion dollars. So we need a plan to start us down that path and that's one of the bills too. So that's my comments. Go ahead.",7958.013,8136.262,"""""",Public Comment,Commenter,1,0
RO_08_28_23,SPEAKER_15,"Thank you.  Yeah well thank you to the commission for the opportunity to speak and condolences I'll throw that for Commissioner Paroosh who took many really important votes on the environment here at the commission and I think was not only a friend to current Royal Oakers but friend to the environment and to future generations as well and just want to recognize that. I also want to recognize that I was just out west I just got back and  Climate's been on my mind a lot recently. Out there, drought is really important. And so some of the ecosystems we see, they're so fragile. 1% of the surface area is actually wetland in places like Colorado, but 40% of the species rely on those wetlands. So when we talk about drought, we see a really delicate balance in our ecosystems. And I think there's a narrative we tell ourselves about Michigan that  we're special, you know, when it comes to climate change, we're gonna have it better than some folks, because we have water, because we have maybe a more moderate temperature than other places. But the reality is, when I was coming home, we were hit with two really powerful and intense storms, and right where my parents live in Livingston County, actually, there was a tornado. We believe there was actually another one, or at least some kind of rotation that knocked out a bunch of trees that wasn't  documented because there was a lot of damage directly in their neighborhood, trees on houses, cars were smashed in, and they were in the basement, you know, huddling, because there's this giant storm around, my retired parents, and, you know, I was getting off a flight where I was stuck at the airport because half of our airport had been closed, and all the flights had been rerouted to the other terminals, so there was not enough transportation services to get everyone off site. So I saw climate change out there, and I saw climate change  here affecting my family and our communities. And it really drove home for me how important this moment is and how in many ways we're just in the opening act. Even if we turned the switch on emissions today, there's a lag. It would take a generation for us to restore the balance in nature. So I just wanna emphasize the bills that are happening today are going on right now in the legislature. It's a once in a generation opportunity for us to take action. This is not gonna come along again.  like this. So I appreciate the attention of the commission to this issue. I appreciate all the work that's been done on the sustainability plan. We are a leading city in many ways when it comes to this and I've enjoyed being on the board and working with a lot of the commission and the volunteers there.  And I just appreciate the time and want to flag that I'm here to answer any questions about the bills if you have it. We have our legislative and political director, Christy, here as well.

RO_08_28_23,SPEAKER_17,"Yes, I have tonight some recommendations from the Royal Oak Citizens Traffic Committee from their July 25th meeting. Tonight there are four proposed resolutions for you and I can certainly take questions during or after the discussion. The traffic committee did vote unanimously on each of the resolutions presented tonight. So item 6A, this was to evaluate speeding on Murray Avenue. This is south of Lexington, kind of in the area where a lot of high schoolers leave, come and go to school.  The committee here is recommending installation of two 25 mile per hour speed limit signs and they have also directed staff to prepare some additional traffic calming options to bring back to them at a future date. Item 6B was a request to add some crosswalk signage for an existing crosswalk that is kind of along the south the southern old truck route at the south end of Irving Avenue and this is where the road has like a 90 degree curve but still continues to be Irving Avenue.  Because it is a somewhat awkward location and it's difficult for westbound drivers to see pedestrians ahead of time, the committee is recommending approval of the installation of crosswalk signs there, just to advise drivers approaching the intersection. The requester also asked that all the signs along the truck route have reflectors installed along the signposts themselves, just to add some additional emphasis to all the signs that are along the route.  Without a significant crash history or observed visibility issue, the committee did not feel that installation of reflectors at every single sign was warranted. They did recommend installing these reflectors on the new crosswalk signs, however, again, just to emphasize that there's a crosswalk there.  The next item is item 6C. This was a request to install new sidewalk ramps to allow pedestrians to cross over Harrison Avenue. This is along the east side of Knoll Street, so kind of in that same area of the city by the old truck route. This area, of course, has seen significant residential development over the past few years, and so a crosswalk here would be appropriate.  The committee is recommending that the ramps be installed and then also add the crosswalk signs there because there is no stop sign at that east-west direction. And they're also requesting that we put post reflectors on those signs as well. And then the final item is 6D. This was a request to remove the no turn on red sign for southbound Delamere. This is at the intersection of Delamere and Normandy.  That no turn on red sign was installed back in 1996 when the traffic signal itself was installed. Normandy Road does rise pretty significantly to the east of the intersection so as you're sitting there looking to your left there's a hill. So you can only see about 250 feet to the east. So that has some potential issues with a shortened sight distance and that's presumably why the sign was installed in the first place.  The available slate distance that is there when we analyze it, it's borderline, depending on how fast traffic is going, whether you have enough time to stop or not, if a car is pulling out into the intersection. So to be on the safer side and a little bit more conservative, the committee is recommending that we keep that no turn on red sign in place. And that's all I have for you tonight.",8612.871,8806.071,"""""",Other,Other,0,0

So what we had said is we've put them on the past in only a few locations and it's usually when there's a pedestrian refuge island in the middle of a road that you might not expect that it's pretty easy you might run into that sign if you're not aware that it's there. So we've put them in those locations and then as we discussed this we said you know if there was a crash history or it's pretty obvious that people just aren't seeing that sign or it's not jumping out at them enough  something to demonstrate that there's really a need to emphasize a sign, because the sign itself is reflective. That's why we design the signs the way that we do, so that you see them at night. So while they do add emphasis, I won't disagree with that. It's the question of, is it warranted for every single situation?

RO_08_28_23,SPEAKER_17,"So we had kind of looked at it and  a progression of solutions. We said, you know, first we could look at doing speed limit signs. Those are pretty simple and don't really impact the residents there a whole heck of a lot. And we thought if we allow parking on that street, it will make it a little more uncomfortable to speed, and that might slow down some traffic. We had quite a few residents, I think maybe five or six show up. And I think all of them were opposed. Nobody was in favor of removing those no parking signs. They felt like it would be a real problem if we did that.  And since those new homes were developed, there was a period of time where parking was allowed because the signs didn't go back up right away. And they said that it was problematic and kind of scary for kids. So the committee took that to heart and said, OK, we'll keep the no parking signs there. And then what we had also presented was, we don't know that it's time to do this yet, but here's a pedestrian refuge, not a refuge island, but a median island, I'll call it, a calming island, kind of closer to Thistle.  Again, just to kind of break a driver's awareness and say, what's going on here? And hopefully they slow down. So one of those traffic calming measures. It was a decent investment of funds. So we said, let's try this first. And if it's still a speeding issue in the future, we have this other idea in our pocket that we could put out there. Most residents were either opposed or just not excited about it. That's a street that it's really hard to put something in.  that doesn't block somebody's driveway. And so anyways, the committee went back and forth, back and forth, and ultimately said, you know, we think bump outs could work here. Can you go back and kind of present something along those lines? So that's a recommendation we can do. I threw something together and, you know, now we're over $100,000 because there's a lot of drainage issues when you do that.

RO_08_28_23,SPEAKER_27,"Yeah, I will just say the cheapest and easiest way to slow traffic on a street is to allow people to park there. It's a compromise between visibility and traffic calming, but I look at some of the narrow streets that I drive down where you've got parking on two sides and one lane of traffic down the middle and people are kind of slaloming around and stopping to let somebody else go by and it sure slows things down. And especially if we're looking to do some sort of trial,  I mean, pulling out a few no parking signs and allowing parking on a street does give us a way to measure whether or not that's going to be successful.

RO_08_28_23,SPEAKER_08,"Good evening, Mayor Fournier, city commissioners. Just an aside before I start, you guys all made really touching tributes to Pat Paroosh this evening. And somebody touched on something about her ability to diplomatically sort of resolve things in conflict when you guys were deliberating things. And on my first city commission meeting, I was scoping everybody out, taking everyone's sides. That was exactly my impression of her.  Very impressive how she was able to do that. And I got to know her a little bit more, not as much as you obviously, but indeed a very sweet lady. So thanks for sharing this with us tonight. As for the item before you, the members from the EAB already did a pretty good job of describing some of it, so I'll try not to be redundant and I'll be brief.  But what's before you is a summary of the 13 pieces of legislation at the state level which address these environmental issues that were discussed. Most prominently, issues that deal with incentivizing and enabling community solar, regulations concerning greenhouse gas emissions and power production, and it also does things like expand the authority of the Michigan Public Service Commission.  to consider environment, health, and other factors when they're making decisions in relation to utility planning and regulation. So this summary, as noted, was put together by the members of the EAB, some of whom are here. Most notably, Paul Vial worked a lot on this, and I just wanted to acknowledge the hard work they do behind the scenes. So in their capacity at our meeting, they decided that these initiatives were important enough to put before the city commission, and so that's what's there for you today to consider.  Because they align with our SCAP goals, should you wish to endorse these in a more firm way, staff would work to draft a letter with a copy of this resolution and transmit that to the legislators that are mentioned here. I don't know what else I can add. I'm not very familiar with the details of them, but we know that some folks here in the audience are and can help with questions related to that.

My first inclination when I saw this package was actually, I agreed with Commissioner Macy on what she was saying, because I know we kind of went through this a couple months ago with another item, but then  Doing some research on this and seeing the broad support, especially among the people who represent us who really share our values, gave me a lot of relief. And then having Senator Chang here tonight and knowing that this is a package of bills that she has co-sponsored, I think is very important. And then also knowing that, you know, the EAB, you know, I was actually at the meeting I sat in,  Chair Herzog, Dr. Herzog invited me down to it that night, that they went through these and there was a long, good discussion on it. And, you know, knowing that Andrew is part of the Sierra Club and this is supported by the Sierra Club, another organization that we all enhancedly support, I know that a lot of people that we trust also support this.

I mean there's a lot that we're doing and like I said we are leading, we're going in the right direction, but we definitely need state help to get there. So this is going to be, you know,  there's political movement moving right now to actually help see this happen. We clearly don't have a vote, but we're just letting our support, right? Like this is letting our friends know that their district, their home district supports what they're doing and how they're going. And once I saw the list of people who are supporting it and know that it includes our  our allies and people that are working with us.

But in the absence of an alternative, for me, it's important to support the work that our folks have done on our behalf here to achieve our goals. I don't know that there's an alternative out there.  currently right now that will help us move the ball.

It's not in final passage, which means it's going to be amended and evolved. But that's the case any time we weigh in on legislation. They could turn white into black and up into down before it gets to the end of the process. But as these bills stand today, most of which are bills that have been introduced multiple sessions over and over again and ignored by previous majorities in the state legislature.  are clearly actions that are aligned with our ASCAP, as Commissioner Cole said, supported by all the leading environmental organizations in the state, who I do trust and support, and are the other side of the coin. There's a lot that we need to do as local governments to activate, to protect, you know, not just combat climate change, which is an imperative, but we're protecting the health and safety and property of our residents. And that has to happen now, and that requires  substantial shift in the status quo, and that requires legislation. And these bills really strike at the heart of the things that need to be done on a statewide systemic level to achieve the kind of change that needs to happen. I think Royal Oak's an important community in speaking out on this. We have a full delegation, a full legislative delegation now. We have four state representatives and two state senators.  I think telling them that we do fully support these bills and the direction that they're going. I'm grateful for the leadership of our Environmental Advisory Board Chair, Amanda Herzog, as well as the efforts of the board members who not only wrote the SCAP and put in all the work to identify real viable solutions we can activate on at the local level, but have done the work to ensure that these bills are aligned with those values and those objectives.  So there's not a question in my mind that sending a message to our legislators that we support this package of bills wholeheartedly, and that we are willing to work with them to ensure that they see the governor's signature before this session is over, I think is absolutely the right thing to do.

So this is a proclamation designating September 10th to 16th, 2023 National Assisted Living Week.  Whereas residents of assisted living communities are active members of the larger community, offering their knowledge, life experiences, and involvement. Their past contributions continue to be a vital part of Royal Oaks' rich history, and their ongoing participation deepens our city's identity.  And whereas assisted living is critical long-term care option for older adults and individuals with disability that fosters choice, dignity, and independence. Assisted living communities are committed to excellence, innovation, and the advancement of person-centered care.  And whereas in 1995, the National Center for Assisted Living established National Assisted Living Week to honor the contributions of assisted living communities in providing long-term care to America's seniors and individuals with disabilities. And whereas this year's theme, National Assisted Living Week, is Season of Reflection, highlights the incredible care provided by essential caregivers and the special bonds created in assisted living facilities across the country.  Whereas during this special week, assisted living communities across the country are encouraged to organize activities and events which celebrate the dedication to staff, the individuality of residents, and the deep connections formed in these settings.  Now therefore be it resolved, I, Mayor Fournier, and the members of the Royal Oak City Commission do hereby proclaim the week of September 10th through the 16th, 2023 as Assisted Living Week in Royal Oak and urge all citizens to virtually visit or call a loved one, family member, or friend residing in any care setting  and offer a kind word and spend time participating in various virtual activities to unite those from all walks of life in need of our continuing love and support, and to learn more about how assisted living services benefit our Royal Oak community.

RO_09_11_23,SPEAKER_05,"Thank you, Mayor Pornier. My purpose in coming tonight is very simple. It's to thank the community for the support  that we as family members of Pat received during her final illness and the follow-up service. I want to start by thanking the Commission. You made wonderful comments about serving with her. You took action to name a new park on her behalf or rename a park on her behalf. You all came over  and visited with her the day after that. She was able to watch you do the park renaming. She especially enjoyed and appreciated all of you coming and spending time with her and respecting the fact that at that point she was beginning to really fail. So you let her go  on a positive note and then you all came and participated in the memorial so thank you for that. I want to thank the Royal Oak Symphony Orchestra and John McLaughlin Williams. Rosso of course performed both before the service and as people were leaving. John did a solo performance of the theme from Schindler's List which if you think about it is  wonderful, good, coming from a horrible situation. John played that and played it wonderfully. John also, two days before Pat passed, came to the home from Ohio, played for her, and was able to interact with her. He was the last non-family member to interact with Pat.  I want to thank Brett from the Metro Detroit Youth Club. His performance as moderator during the memorial service was exemplary and he has been a resource for me and for my daughters as we went through this difficult time. I want to thank the speakers who honored Pat.  Mayor Fournier as the first, former Mayor Ellison, former Mayor and CEO Ralph Costelli, our neighbor and friend of 40 plus years, Libby Richards, Pat's sister Gail, and my two daughters. They spoke, all of you spoke, of how important it was to know Pat  and how important it was that she provide an example to us as we go forward. I want to thank the members of the general community, those who came to the service and those who couldn't, but who sent their good wishes, their cards, their support  They dropped off food, they dropped off muffins, they dropped off treats. Kept us all very sugar high for the entire time. I want to thank the city businesses who participated in the memorial service in one way or another. Sullivan Funeral Directors, D'Amato's Restaurant,  Give Thanks Bakery, Lux, Event Linen Supplier, and very, very importantly, the Farmer's Market and its staff, who extended themselves to make this a wonderful service and a wonderful venue for the service. Pat wanted it at the Farmer's Market, and they came through. I want to thank hospice.  You don't thank caregivers in that sense all too often, but they were there for all of us as family members and they were there for Pat. Finally, I want to thank the members of the city staff, the police whose honor guard did the flag folding, Mr. Brake and the senior staff for all of their support.  and very especially Judy Davids who put together a beautiful summary of Pat's career here in Royal Oak and who was there to provide support in every way possible. So thanks to Judy, thanks to the city,  thanks to the entire community. I'm thanking you tonight on behalf of myself and my entire family. Kathy tonight is spending time with our granddaughter, helping her with her homework. She got a pretty good size homework assignment today. Anne is in DC on behalf of her organization.

Second, I think we need to refocus it more towards art.  I feel like the art we've been getting now is kind of box truck art. People go around the shows. It'd be cooler to see more avant-garde stuff from local artists featuring artists, minority artists, women artists, local artists, have it more focused on things like that.  I know the downtown dollars for some retailers, that's been helping any revenue that's offset by the festival. But I know for a lot of other retailers and businesses, they're taking a pretty hard hit. And I'm hoping there's some way we can make it more equitable for those businesses that are severely affected. For example, the salon on 6th, I overheard maybe 30K that weekend.  Make it more equitable, possibly put the booths in the middle so that the storefronts are more accessible and visible.

I'm sure she loved the city. I love what I'm doing in the city and at Memorial Park and hopefully  this love for the city and everything is going to continue carrying on. At the previous commission meeting I was pleasantly surprised of the many people both from Memorial Oak and surrounding communities to support what we're doing at Memorial Park. Since the last meeting I spent three days in Minnesota meeting with the leadership from the new league we are looking to join. We learned a lot and we realized we need really need to work on upgrading Memorial Park.  I have a proposal I'm going to share with John Fidelity and Aaron Filipsky that is broken into two areas. Some major capital improvement type things and some smaller improvements that our program will work to cover the cost and leave no burden on the city. All of our improvements are to benefit this park for the city and will bring more people to see and experience Royal Oak. I believe this is a good thing. I also believe that our proposed improvements will continue to grow the game for the youth of Royal Oak.  who will then grow into being proud descendants of the local ROSL program. With this potential new league affiliation, I've received a phone call from another one of my former players who played at University of Michigan.  even though I'm a Spartan grad, I'll say that. And he also played in the Miners for a few years. He wants to get involved. I've also received some support from two other very prominent businesspersons, one who's very involved with the Detroit Lions of all things, but he's a former baseball player that I coached when I was at Birmingham Groves. These two people love what we're doing. They love the area. They just see a lot of great potential for it. They want to get involved.  So I'm meeting with John Daly on Wednesday at the park, and I hope to pass our proposal on to you in the weeks to come. We're a nonprofit organization. My books are open. You'll see that my salary's lower than the ones what you're making right here at being a commissioner. There's basically no salary. I do it for the love of it.

RO_09_11_23,SPEAKER_16,"Janice Wagman. First I want to say thank you for the invocation. It was excellent. Really appreciated that. Regarding the number nine on the agenda about sending a postcard out with a URL and a QR code, I'm strongly opposed to this. And the reason being seniors and low income individuals.  I don't know where this idea came from. SIREN, we're paying SIREN $150,000 a year to maximize communication efforts, including on topics like taxes. So I'm wondering if they approved this, if they thought this was a good idea, or if it was the city manager's office when the city manager has presented the aging in place plan, which specifically states that one in three Oakland County seniors is digitally illiterate, and people still prefer low tech options.  SEMCOG says that 7.4% of Royal Oak households, not just seniors, do not have an internet subscription. So why should they be made to jump through hoops to get the same information that everybody else does? Not to mention many times when people get postcards, they think they're advertising and they just toss them out. They don't bother to read them. So what is the purpose? Why switch to this? Is it to save money? I can think lots of ways to save money, and this should not be one of them.  To the Commission, how does this satisfy your strategic goal of equity and inclusion? Frankly, I'd like to say I'm surprised by this proposal, but I'm not. Given the failure to provide more on-street parking, handicap parking in the downtown, forcing people to park in parking structures that were constructed without ADA doors, prioritizing sundowning a committee over creating a new one to implement the Aging in Place Plan, completed nine months ago,  I'm not surprised that once again, seniors and in this case, lower income households are being marginalized. I urge the city commission to vote no on this proposal. Stay with the regular plan of sending out a letter to every voter. How much time do I have?

RO_09_11_23,SPEAKER_15,"Good evening. I'm Michael Kessler, Best Life Cannabis, 32767 Woodward Avenue. As a quick recap, I'm the owner of Best Life. I submitted Best Life's application in January of 2021. Best Life was officially awarded its license from the city in June 2022. After completing all city, state, CRA inspections, Best Life has officially now opened.  Back in 2019, Michigan Cannabis Regulatory Agency, CRA, created the Adult Use Microbusiness License to allow only in-state residents the opportunity to own and operate fully integrated small business in their local community. As we all know, since 2019 and 2021, a lot has changed in this world, for us and especially business owners. The general cost of living, wages, materials, you name it, almost the cost of everything has risen, except cannabis due to the saturation of the market currently.  At the beginning of 2023, the CR made several revisions to the rules, licenses, and license fees to keep up with the times and ensure that as this new market continues to mature and continue to provide an exceptional amount of state tax revenue, that no one was left behind or at a disadvantage. Currently, Best Life is allowed to cultivate 150 cannabis plants, process cannabis goods, and sell our cannabis goods. We are not allowed to bring in any other cannabis goods from any other company.  This was the original micro-business license that the CRA created back in 2019. One of the rule changes the CRA made was with the micro-business license. The state has offered the micro-business licensee the opportunity to choose which micro-business best suits their business needs. They sell the original micro-business license and have added the option to convert an existing micro-business license into a micro-business Class A.  A Class A microbusiness license allows the licensee to cultivate up to 300 cannabis plants. It does not allow the licensee to process the cannabis. Those 300 cannabis plants would only be packaged as flower. The licensee is also able to bring in processed goods from other processors in Michigan. Best Life is requesting that the City of Royal Oak take into consideration the transition of Best Life Cannabis microbusiness into a Class A microbusiness.  multiple micro-businesses across the state who chose to make the transition are already operational as Class A micro-businesses. The reason for this transition into a Class A micro-business license is to create more jobs in our community. We project that Best Life would be able to generate twice as many jobs if we were operating as a Class A. We would also be able to have higher pay for our employees as this would generate more management positions.  The Class A license will allow a broader selection of products for our customers and allow us to have more specific medicinal cannabis products that we would not be able to produce as a standard microbusiness. The Class A license will allow Best Life more opportunities to become more active in our community with local events and charities.  With this short time allowance, there are many major benefits in regards to how Class A is better fit for Best Life Cannabis, and I hope the City of Royal Oak can see these benefits for both sides and all of its community members.

RO_09_11_23,SPEAKER_19,"Well first, hello everyone. My name is Teresa Mullen and I am the owner of The Fern here in Royal Oak, 406 East 4th Street. I am a new small business here. We just celebrated one year, August, this past August, so we made the first year mark. There's no going back from here, but I wanted to show up today.  and just let you guys know that I still have no employees, and that is my own fault. I'm very controlling over my business, and I blame that probably on my mother, so. I'm here for two reasons today. One is to thank the city commission for the ARPA funding for Arts, Beats, and Eats. As a small business, that really helps us out when it comes to marketing materials and extra costs, so I deeply appreciate that.  And I also wanted to share my input on what an amazing weekend I had at Arts Beats & Eats as a small business. This was our second year at Arts Beats & Eats. Not only did the city support us, but Arts Beats & Eats provided us with a discounted booth space due to the firm being a small business.  I'm not going to be specific on what our bottom line was, but the results were very positive and had a very nice impact on my small business as we head into the winter months. It definitely helps me out and I'm going to be hiring someone soon.  But it was also a chance to promote my location since we are on the end of East 4th Street over here. We're kind of hidden and kind of in like a little nook there, but if you haven't been, I encourage you to because we have a really nice patio and some really good drinks too.  So my family supported me on the labor side, and I had a lot of friends and support of our regular customers that come in when it came to this event. And while it was kind of hot the last couple days of Arts Beats & Eats,  I found it incredibly beneficial to my small business. I was able to meet a lot of new people, a lot of new customers that I then saw the following week, and they are now regulars now, believe it or not. So I've heard a ton of feedback from my friends and customers, and I'm glad that there's a festival like this that my small business can participate in.  Events like Arts Beats and Eats and Royal Oak Taco Fest are great for promoting and bringing people to downtown but it also again directly had a profound positive impact on my business and I just wanted to share that with you today. So thank you for the ARPA funding and thank you for allowing a positive festival to come into the city. I know that some may disagree but as a small business owner who  literally has my mom work for me for free. It definitely helps us, and I would like to share some positive light to that.

I am also here to express gratitude to the City of Royal Oak as well as the ARPA funding and share experiences of a successful weekend at the Arts Beats Needs Festival.  So in the past, we've operated at limited hours over the weekend and have run Labor Day sales cutting into our margins just to keep up with the slower external retail climate over those four days. This year, despite some procrastination from my end,  We were given ARPA funding and a discounted rate, as well as a prime location on 4th and Washington, where we set up a booth for our meal prep company that we run on the side. Normally we prepare those meals in advance, but here we live cooked three different menu items where it was just meat, rice, veggies, seasoned up real nice.  In addition to that we had some extra hands on deck and we were able to market the very diverse and new customers that we would not have been able to see elsewhere. In addition to.  a very successful weekend in revenue. We also managed to make a ton of new prospects. Our pre-orders for the following week was almost double what it normally would have been, just from the patrons that we spoke to at the festival. And we also prospected a lot of customers for our supplement store that is the brick and mortar location in downtown Royal Oak.  While at the same time we had closed our store location but left a sign on the door, allowing people to call myself or my business partner's phone number if they came by. We walked over to the store and took care of them. And despite that, we still ended up doing pretty well in revenue for the storefront as well. All in all, I just wanted to express gratitude to the City of Royal Oak, to the Arts Beats & Eats staff, and the ARPA funding for what was an ultimately very successful weekend. Thank you guys.

RO_09_11_23,SPEAKER_09,"All right, Mr. Brake, I'm handing it over to you. All right. Good evening, Mayor Pornyang and members of the City Commission. I am proposing to you a way of, through brevity, a summarization of not only the road millage, but also both ballot items. So the notion of including a web address and using a QR code is coming from me.  and this recommendation. With that being said is that we're still compiling a letter and we'll make that available to anyone that wishes to receive that. So before sending this off to the printer and presenting this to you, and I appreciate the help that I've received internally, especially in staff with Ms. Judy Davids and others that helped get their input.  and some pointers on the way of best conveying the information. So it is critical as we look at the coming 10 years to finish off the road paving and construction work as we're looking at 50 miles of road.  and upon the completion of this, assuming that this does pass at that funding period, that we will be well over 90% of having neighborhoods as well as major corridors or sometimes referred to as major streets.  At the same time, we do allude to information that was initiated by the citizens, not by this commission, but on the rank choice voting and the information that's on there and have complete language of  the changes that will be made to the city charter. So the language on the ballot is just a limited description. But when you look at the actual wording change to the city charter, there would be information for individuals who want to read those changes, how they can go about to obtain them. So I present that to you. This is a little bit different approach. To get this out, we intend on going to the printer tomorrow.  to have this printed, but if you so choose to do a letter in addition to that, I'm very mindful of this is information only that we are presenting and do not want any appearance of advocating. So it's presented in a neutral stance, but to what extent  the amount of information and mailers that we have go out is kind of the fundamental question. It isn't so much of a cost savings as it is better use of dollars. So everyone's busy and to come across quite succinctly what this proposal entails, but yet for anyone that wants to know what the actual amount that they pay at their property,  There's a way of going to the website to obtain that information. Also, what are the proposed prospective streets that we plan on paving? And the demonstration on here, kind of an overview. Someone made that suggestion of having a brief overview map that shows the intended major streets. And this gives us, if passed,  an opportunity to combine funding through state and federal sources and other grant opportunities where we can leverage considerably local dollars and to achieve the maximum amount of return.  I'm presenting this for your approval and we'll carry this out, but whatever ways that you want us to disseminate the letters and anyone that will respond. I'm also providing hard copies at the Senior Center, at the library, and other places where we have provided.  So we will do that. But I'll defer to what your wishes are and staff will carry that out. So if there's any questions that I can answer or then the information about the  the road millage program. Let's see Ms. Downey who's here and then can respond if we want to revisit any of the specifics on that proposal. But for our purposes tonight, just looking at the dissemination of communication.

I worry about, like a letter from the city is something that people are more likely, I think, to read.

I think we should send the letter in addition because there are folks that will actually read this and not the letter because this is brief. People have three kids. They're moving 100 miles an hour and they know an election's coming around. They know something's on the ballot.  And now they can say, oh, I have an understanding of what it is. I'm going to set it here and then click on that if they're tech savvy to do it.

And then if they get a letter in the mail following it, then it's a second opportunity to touch those people so they're informed because it is their decision. It's not our decision. It's the voters' decision what they want to do with these proposals.  So I think it gives us a little extra coverage. It gives us a couple modes of medium to communicate with people that might not all be on the same page. And everyone's on social media. Either because they're tech savvy or because they know it's often accessible. Personal opinion, sorry.

We have both prepared. It's the letter. We want to make a few more edits to it before this thing goes out, including having the official presentation. So this will be the third letter since I've been here that we have disseminated information on previously on campaign efforts. And so it does go out in the Royal Oak envelope. And I would agree with you. People receive information differently in response to that. So point well taken.  But I think given the summary and someone that does want to delve into, and there's a considerable amount of webpages, like I said, so anyone that wants to know specific to their property, there is a calculator that's in there that you can put in your address and it'll show, what is this two and a half mils? What is the first year of this levy?  than addition of the 10-year plan from 2025 to 2034. Am I saying those years right? Yes. And it shows year by year that the projected roads that we intend to reconstruct, repave, again,  focusing mainly on, I don't want to get caught up in too much of the technical, but what we commonly refer to major streets. So for most people, it's the roads that we take to go to work or to  worship or groceries or the major thoroughfares that we're really concentrating on that. With that being said, there are some neighborhoods that have been identified and those streets will be listed if someone's wondering when is my street going to be repaved and so, and I'll get some guidance on that, but that's  Part of that will be determined on a year-by-year basis, so it may not have the exact information at this point. It is a projection. Costs do increase as materials and labor are associated with that. That's my only word of caution out there.  The plan comes about and 2031 rolls around and says, hey, I understand that the street that I normally go to work was supposed to be repaved. The engineering department does an excellent job of keeping individuals informed of construction activities.  leading up to bidding out projects. So the communication process is ever-continuing on that basis. Again, we're happy to do both. They're set in motion.

RO_09_11_23,SPEAKER_09,"I'm presenting this for your consideration, but if there's specific questions that could be answered. We visited this topic this past fall of partnering with our neighboring communities through a planning grant to conduct some continuity along this important corridor.  This corridor and their neighboring communities connects to nearby schools. And in Royal Oak, it makes the connection to two important nonprofit organizations, which is the YMCA as well as the Detroit Metro Youth Club that are in close proximity. The idea is to encourage multimodal transportation. The design elements of 11 Mile are not decided.  There's been discussion about that at the traffic committee, and that will come at a later time. So what's different this time around is that we have even a greater number of partners that are coming forward, which includes Madison Heights, a long amount to go the entire distance in that community and a small portion in the city of Southville. So we have a greater number of communities that are coming forward, and it tells a compelling story.  This aligns nicely with the SCAP, especially as we promote non-motorized transportation and make it safer for individuals to traverse. Over the last six years that we've documented that there has been  six or seven either pedestrian or bicycle accidents that have occurred on the street. And if there's a way that we can minimize or entirely eliminate that from happening would make this a safer corridor for someone to traverse. So there are approximately 39,000 people that work in Royal Oak.  and not all of them live here. And so we have individuals that commute from nearby communities. And if this makes it safer for people to get to their place of work and help them in doing so, it's that much better. So looking at authorization to submit this, our neighboring communities are doing the same thing.  meetings of authorizing the staff to submit this grant. We're hoping now that we'll have a stronger presentation. Our new grants writer, grant coordinator, Jill Martin, has been working actively with part of this collaborative effort and her kind of energy and ideas, I have even greater optimism that we'll have a successful grant program.  The planning grant will offset the cost. There will be a local match that will be associated with that. This will help us to compile the construction documents to bid this out across these jurisdictions. Regardless of this program, as mentioned, we do have in the CIP, it's several years out, but we do have a call for  making not only the repaving this area, but also placemaking opportunities that will make a better presentations as someone is coming off of I-75 and entering into our community and make that much more inviting. So there's just many different elements that will just help our community as well as our neighboring communities.  working together to make this transformational change in this region. And if there's ways that we can be leaders of helping to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by promoting non-motorized transportation, that's all the better.  So this is presented for your consideration, but if there's technical questions pertaining to 11 Mile, Ms. Donahue is here to answer those questions, but we would like your authorization to submit this grant with the application deadline coming up at the end of this month.

And 11 Mile was always top of mind for people, like, what can we do with 11 Mile to make it more pedestrian and business and resident friendly? As right now, it is not necessarily fertile ground for those things. I live at Porter and 11 Mile, and I'm often seeing families rushing across it with strollers to get across, because there's no crosswalks for a half mile at a time. So I think opening the door to that conversation is probably a very prudent thing to do.  With, you know, the fact that there is no plan on the table, this is giving us the opportunity to have a conversation about the highest and best use of this space. There's obviously chatter in the community about there being a plan. There is no plan.

So Mr. Grochowski has done an excellent job of kind of outlining where the authority exists.  But at the same time, I invited Mr. Craig here to answer what the current practice is. There are ordinances in place, but begin this discussion if we do want to have another layer of regulation. But the tools are currently out there.

RO_09_11_23,SPEAKER_11,"Thank you Mayor.  So the way it works right now, I think the logic's a little backwards, where the dust has to be leaving the site before it would trigger enforcement, because that means the harm is being done before we institute a fix. And to me, it's kind of reminiscent of the conversation we had years ago about fencing, right? Around construction sites, we used to have nothing.  And we had a lot of conversation around what's our rights, what's good for the neighborhood. And where Atlanta was really, our residents are pretty patient with a lot of construction, with rebuilds and remods and teardowns and things. And our goal should really be to minimize any inconvenience or negative impact on our residents if this is going to continue, which it clearly is.  So to Commissioner Macy's point, I think it'd be better if it's just a status quo when they apply for a demo permit, which they do have to apply for a permit, where they identify their means of dust remediation, and then it's just expected that they're going to use that method. So if the method's listed here, they choose one, and then upon inspection, we determine whether or not they're using it. Now, whether or not the harm's already being done, because you can't put that genie back in the bottle, right? And I understand it might seem like overkill from your point of view, but if  Of 20 sites, there is one site that has dangerous particles that are impacting its neighbors. I'm more than happy to put the burden on the builder, who's going to be more than adequately compensated for what they're doing here in Rylab, to take that extra precaution. And I don't think it does any harm to our local economy, or it's only a good thing that we're going above and beyond to protect our residents and the quality of life in our neighborhoods. So to the extent that this says,  The city commission may certainly examine and discuss other lawful enforcement mechanisms and ordinance amendments should they believe that there is additional legally permissible safeguards on. I'll leave that to you to tell them it's legally permissible, but to the conversation you're having with Commissioner Macy, I'm going to say you must use one of these methods and you must identify it on your demo permit.

This doesn't only apply to exterior demo, but if I'm doing a drywall job in my house and you put a new drywall and you finish and you mud it, there are clouds all over the place inside the house and the dust eventually settles on the floor of the house. I just want to make sure as we're doing this, we're mindful we're doing this for exterior demolitions and dust that would  go extra, right, and not, I mean, to wet down, like, let's say I choose water, do I actually spray down my drywall with water, right, when I'm doing this?

Last week, Canadian auto workers ratified a historic contract with Ford Motor Company. And thousands of UAW workers are on strike today with audacious demands that hope to return auto workers to their once-held status as premier manufacturing positions.  Starbucks workers across the country have filed petitions to join a union, fighting store by store against a Goliath who has refused to bargain in good faith with his employees. For my entire life, working people have received a smaller and smaller share of the pie. They've been asked to make sacrifices to help companies be competitive. They've been told constantly that they're lucky to have a job and that some economic calamity or another necessitates givebacks and concessions.  Wages stagnate, medical insurance costs rise, a pension's unthinkable, and you should count your lucky stars to get a modest 401k match. That system is broken, and people from varied walks of life are standing up for their rights to dignity, a decent life, and in the private sector, the right to a fair share of a company's success. People cannot keep working more for less. Labor unions have an important role to play in that struggle, and it's empowering to see them revitalized.  What's most inspiring to me about a labor union in action is the core labor concept of solidarity. In a labor union, regardless of your race, gender, sexuality, political beliefs, you unite in common purpose to seek improvements for everyone. Millionaire TV and movie writers held out so that young writers aren't exploited. Highly compensated UAW skilled trade employees are on the line fighting for temporary workers who make $16 an hour.

Whereas the Royal Oak Public Library is an essential institution that serves as a cornerstone of knowledge, learning, and civic and community engagement.  And whereas libraries play a vital role in fostering education, lifelong learning, and literacy for people of all ages, backgrounds, and abilities. And whereas libraries provide a welcoming and inclusive environment that encourages exploration, discovery, and personal growth. And whereas libraries offer access to a diverse array of resources, including books, digital media, educational entertainment programs, and technology.  And whereas libraries play a significant role in promoting the right to read and the right to access information, enabling individuals to make informed decisions and engage in open discourse. And whereas the Royal Oak Public Library highlights and celebrates the right to read, view and listen to what you choose during Banned Books Week, which takes place October 1st through 7th, 2023.  And whereas libraries provide essential services to understand communities, bridging digital divide, and offering critical support for job seekers, students, and individuals seeking to improve their lives. And whereas hundreds of libraries and millions of library supporters across Michigan are celebrating Michigan Library Appreciation Month this October.  Now, therefore, be it resolved, I, Mayor Fournier, and the members of the Royal Oak City Commission do hereby proclaim October 2023 as Michigan Library Appreciation Month. During this time, I encourage all residents, community organizations, and public officials to join in celebrating the libraries in our community, their dedicated staff, and the countless ways in which libraries enrich our lives and contribute to the betterment of society.

If anything they're catatonic sitting behind the wheel sitting at a green light. That's what I'm seeing. I don't see speeders. Either way this project is going to cost an arm and a leg based upon what I'm seeing here and  We could be putting this towards the roads that need repair, utility that needs repair. Monica had made mention to it during the forum. You know, putting efforts towards the roads, surface of the roads, repaving. These roads are cut horribly, cracked. I mean, the cars are falling apart. I mean, I'm seeing it. So the cost of this  I'm just curious. I'm dying to know how much this would cost just along this Northwood sector.

And it's due in part to the parking meters. Granted, there's a lot of parking structures. Sure, they can park there. But here's the thing. The folks are putting money in the meter. They're paying the meter and they're still getting cited. Now, MPS, Municipal Parking Systems out of Minnesota,  has a great review rating online. They're not just doing this here in Royal Oak, they're doing this throughout the entire country in cities just like Royal Oak. And that in itself is concerning. I mean, there could have been some things done. I know there was a no-bid contract that was voted on back in what, 2012, 2013?  put you guys in a bit of a pinch.

I'm here tonight to talk about partially parking and also electric vehicles.  The perfect circle back today came when I was walking and I saw a train going through town is on my way to Royal Oak Masala, which is a great place you should go to. And I saw probably about a dozen, I don't know if they were empty or full, tanks of fuel going through our town. And I think that underscores the reason why we need to, even though it is,  expensive embrace electronic availability to electric vehicle charging now. None of the handicapped spaces in the garages have access to electric vehicle charging. That's an accessibility issue.  And that definitely is, I don't think it's acceptable, personally. I think the, you know, I don't really like the new parking system. I do hope you guys would have the will to change vendors. But that said, we still have these posts everywhere that have electricity running to them. And if those could be somehow modified into chargers that deliver a light charge to vehicles,  while they were in town could make the street parking look even more attractive. Aging in place, about that, please keep in mind that people who are younger and intend to age in place like myself, and my specific concern is that  Too much of downtown would be bought up by people who seek to sell condos to somebody who has no interest in ownership. And just because I have no ownership interest doesn't mean I don't care about this city. I care about this city very much. It just means it's not a wise financial decision for me.

What's dangerous about this? People need respect with difference of views, ethnic backgrounds, skin color, lifestyles, gender preference, age, economic status, etc.  Sometimes in government, local and national, we see good teams suddenly go bad. Like when a 4-3 vote for a developer's bad project oddly becomes 7-0 for the pro-developer and is still a bad project. How do you guide adults to help the individual and common good  when they have been tarnished by bad decisions or bad behavior and swayed to go with the click they know are wrong and unethical? How do you stop this cycle? You ask the adults to look deep inside and think how they hurt someone by their actions, just like you ask a child, maybe an apology, certainly always telling the truth. You teach that child to be honest and admit their mistakes. Why am I discussing this?  I believe our city government needs to move forward in many ways, but most of all we need to move with care and thoughtfulness. Back when people could trust each other, choose quality of life over bigger, flashier buildings and homes, taking care of what we already have versus being greedy and wanting more and more while harming the environment.  Treating our neighbors' hardships like family and not letting big development ruin anyone's life. People first, not money first. Let's get rid of the government clicks now by listening and bringing in more voices. You might find out that those other voices always wanted what was best, but they weren't listened to because they weren't in the click. Just like in high school.  Special thanks to Jimmy Carter, Democrat, who founded Habitat for Humanity. Wasn't it a click?  Abe Lincoln, Republican, helped abolish slavery. Wasn't it a click? And I know this sounds weird, but Kermit the Frog, It's Not Easy Being Green Party, who helps our greatest hope for the future, our children, building their self-esteem, spreading kindness, so that maybe we won't have any more dangerous clicks.

How do you think they would feel when one day the word gets to them that they are likely to have a major change in their lives? The fact here is that the subject is not zoned for this plan.  A few years ago, a builder wanted to get a variance to build two homes on our block. It was about 10 years ago, actually. The board considered the wishes of the residents that attended the meeting and decided in our favor.  One, two, three, it's done. Why is this so difficult? This system requires only four votes, I could be wrong, you can correct me, to decide on the lives of the residents. Although getting seven votes here is not usually a problem.  Over the last few years, we have been told that these and other changes will not affect our values. That was an insult, similar to saying the world is flat. Now we have another. Parking won't be a problem because only one person will be occupying the unit.  What is the point of having zoning if it is only to approve variances to please those who have enough money and feel entitled to harm a neighborhood, whether it's for new construction, additions, or other uses? Unfortunately, this is not the only area of the city that has experienced or plan to have detrimental changes, not only the residents, but the whole city will be affected.

I was hoping since we were promised that the strategic goals there would be a portal at the end of the first quarter that I'd be able to click on it and see a bar chart on the progress and that type of thing. I can't. There's a lot of information out there but there isn't like a simple  what I would think that a software program would generate. I was on lead teams for ERP implementation. I'm all for software, but I would like to see more transparent information to the public.

The state of Michigan has it on their website. Keep that in mind when you're approving the OpenGov software tonight.

We have 19,000.  citizens of the city of Royal Oak, residents of the city of Royal Oak who are 50 and over.

And speaking of adding items to the agenda, SIREN, we signed a contract six months ago for a minimum of $150,000 that was including scope of work, preparing reporting materials, attending and presenting communication impact at the city commission meeting. They do this all the time with the DDA and I'd like to see something similar here as part of their contract.  And speaking of transparency, in our charter, there's lots of ordinances. Many of them are outdated. They need to be looked at. We're going through reorganizing the list so it's easy to access different items on there. But one that's in there that shouldn't be.  excluded and I think is very important is the ethics ordinance. And in the ethics ordinance, it says that you are required as members of the city commission to fill out a form like this that states what property interests you have, what business interests you have, what interest family members may have, that it's 10% or more.

I noticed the most important items, 10 and 11, get moved to the bottom of the agenda. I guess that's to reduce some of the opposition that's going on. And I noticed that instead of it being written plainly for people to understand, it's now got parcel number 2507101-027. It should be in plain English so people that come to the  Commissioner meetings and the planning meetings know what exactly is going on. I want to make a point. Last time it took three votes. It seems like you guys are voting until you get the vote you want. And then it was passed on with no recommendation of the Greenfield project. I'm totally against that. Here's the consensus that I see going in Royal Oak. We have the Genesee project  We have the Phillips Project. We have the Greenfield Project. We have the East Harrison Project. It seems to be an ongoing trend to overdevelop properties with no regard to the single family units. I need you to understand that the single family is the core of Royal Oak. After everybody leaves, we're the ones that are usually holding the bill  Residents, when they want a variance for their private property, a lot of times they get a lot of no's and it's not allowed. It seems that when developers want a variance that a lot of leeway is given to them even though they know it's wrong and even though the residents are against it.  Here's the problem, OK? I'm a strong union guy. I've been in many labor negotiations. When you give variances to one developer, they have a tendency to look at each other and say, hey, you did it for them. You did it for them. You did it for them. Totally against the Greenfield project. I got passed on with no recommendation. And that should tell you automatically that it should be dead.  Another thing is, and like one of the other residents talked about, if you're taking money, whatever your interest is, from a developer for an election campaign, it should be brought to the attention of the public and you should accuse yourself on voting on it.

RO_09_25_23,SPEAKER_06,"I think I'm probably best qualified to take this. So the city commission approved the Krieger-Klatt contract for architectural services in late February of this year to get the schematic drawings going. Concurrently, we are working with the city attorney's office and outside counsel on drafting a development purchase agreement with the other party.  Roughly, the project would entail taking a building owned by this private party, splitting it into half of it. The front half would be the animal shelter, and this is at 2005 Bel Air. The back portion of it would remain under control of the private property owner.  As we were working through the development agreement and working with our planning and building departments, it became pretty clear that this project from a zoning perspective was much more complicated than any of us had thought. So much so that as we're building in a development agreement where you have certain outs and you have certain timelines on city entitlements being granted within time A or time B,  we couldn't put anything on paper. We were literally redrawing based on direction that we were getting from our community development director and our planning director. And at some point, every project experiences a little bit of deal fatigue. And I think the other party was feeling that as well. And so we regrouped in the summer and we said, you know, perhaps the best way of moving forward with this is to actually try to secure the entitlements first.  If this needs to go through ZBA or planning commission, we will have the private property owner work on pushing that through. And then that solves a lot of the heavy lifting we are trying to do legally in the development agreement. And so that's where we're at right now. And that's what this action item is.  have already performed survey work at the Bel Air building. We've learned more about that in terms of we're not allowed to have an outdoor dog track. We're going to have to move it inside. This is coming from our planning department.  We're going to have to put in a firewall that we necessarily weren't looking at doing. First it was two, now it's one. That's fine, we will secure these entitlements. The other portion is the actual animal shelter facility itself, which is part of a large DPS parcel that goes from Campbell.  all the way to the Matthew Hargraves Chevrolet lot line. We need to delineate a separate property parcel ID for that, as we're doing with Bel Air. And so it's a lot of these steps that are taking a lot of time. We're optimistic that we may be able to bring something before the planning commission within the next three months.  Um, this work is critical for us to, to get to that point. Essentially when you're on CBA or planning commission and you're having architects and engineers bringing you plans, um, these are plans that we're preparing for. And, and you know, that's part of the reason we requested $200,000 of the city commission and ARPA funding for soft costs to get this project to the point where we would have a development agreement. And so, um,  That's where we stand right now once we get this survey work done. We'll be able to have a package along with our architect who is redesigning based upon the feedback that we received from community development.

And so the resolutions that you have this evening  complete the resolutions for the first reading of the creating the new board as well as a portion to help separate out that function and essentially restore the Parks and Recreation and Senior Services Advisory Board to being just Parks and Recreation.

I just think that even when we did this many years ago, that was a little, I don't want to say heavy handed, but a little administrative, a little not warm. And I think that the appointments committee has the ability to appoint people they believe are good for the position. Those people go in with great intentions,  And they may have personal issues. They may have all of a sudden work issues. They didn't expect kid issues and things happen. And sometimes that conversation needs to happen to say, hey, you've missed a lot of meetings. Probably time to maybe step aside. Or it's temporary. Like, hey, you know what?  you know, an issue, I was ill, whatever it may be. But I think the appointments committee can always decide to leave that, you know, if you only have one applicant and that person's already on six boards, you might leave, you know, that position open as opposed to putting someone that's on six boards already. Not that anyone's on six boards, but I'm just trying to.  make the example. Sometimes having a vacancy is an appointment itself. To me it seems like this is way harder than it needs to be. Our liaison should be taking attendance or should be in the board minutes. If people are missing that should go into some sort of  database and the appointments committee should see and be triggered to say, okay, by the way, even though this person had a three-year appointment or two-year appointment, they're six months in, they've already hit the absence threshold, do you want to keep them on board or not?  And if they keep it on board and they get more absences, then the next appointments meeting they can say, all right, we're going to replace that individual. And the individual has every opportunity to be notified that this is going to take place. There's an appointment so you can show up to the appointments meeting or you can write them a letter or the liaison can write something. But it seems to me like the rigidity of it seems a little bit  you know for volunteer positions. I mean I don't even know if I would be this harsh with some of my employees as far as the rigidity and they're getting paid. So I mean I get the concept I support the idea of making sure people know when they sign up to volunteer in their community it's serious and people depend on them and you know we need volunteers and we and they have an ability to contribute and we didn't there just always seem to be a little bit when we did this a little too formal a little bit too technical.

It was kind of on the chair of the committee or the staff to maybe flag for the clerk that someone hasn't been to six meetings in a row. The clerk would have to track that person down, try and find out if they want to be on the committee.  And without any actual rules or governance around this, we're holding seats that someone may not want or maybe something's happened in their life and they can't attend for committee appointments that we have dozens of people waiting for that really want to serve. And I think clarity around this process and  Some sort of absolute expectation of what you're going to do and what you're not going to do and when it's time to leave is helpful both for the volunteers and for the city and makes those committees more productive and also inevitably would open up spots for folks who are waiting in line who really want to volunteer for one of these spots.

It's in the city's multiple family residential zoning district, which under the current standards would allow for three residential units. And the petitioner is seeking tonight for a first reading to rezone the property to planned unit development with the associated development agreement for 10 dwelling units.  They are proposing 16 parking spaces. The standard for a residential dwelling unit is two parking spaces per unit. Their calculation or ratio comes out to 1.6 parking spaces per unit. They do have some other deviations from zoning ordinance standards such as the  depth of parking spaces. Each parking space is required to be at least 9 feet in width and 20 feet in depth. The proposed parking spaces are 18 feet in depth. And the drive aisle, the center drive aisle to access the parking spaces measures 15 feet and it's required under the ordinance to be 16 feet.  The setback of the building is approximately 15 feet from the property line under the ordinance. The standard is 25.  and the petitioner is they would be removing all of the trees on site in which they've had a certified arborist and the city's arborist has also verified that the trees are are in diseased or deteriorated condition and so they're asking for a waiver from the standard to replace that in equal or to pay that  the fee associated with it, which would total $36,000 if the City Commission did apply that fee. The petitioner was at the Planning Commission's August and September Planning Commission agendas meetings, and at the August meeting, the item was postponed.

RO_09_25_23,SPEAKER_28,"Thank you very much Mr. Mayor and members of the City Commission. My name is Dennis Cowan with the law firm of Plunkett & Cooney and I'm representing Baker Properties, LLC. Our owner, Rudy Cachette, is here this evening along with Dorian Moore and Mark Nikita from Archive Design which is our design team and we'll be glad to answer as many questions as we can. We don't have the certified arborist with us and I don't pretend to be one.  But I'll address that in a moment. First of all, a little bit about Mr. Kashet. First of all, he was born and raised here in Royal Oak. He was a proud graduate of Lockman, Churchill, and Kimball, and now lives here in his single-family home, and is looking forward to the opportunity to do a modest two-story, 10-unit, multifamily project here on Greenfield, just south of 13 Mile Road.  This is a classic infill project. An infill is basically, say, it's the property left over after everybody else has developed. And I do want to bring to your attention, I gave you a little Google Earth picture with my letter, and it shows that from Greenfield all the way from Webster, which is 12 and a half, all the way up to 13 mile in Greenfield,  And then all the way over to Beaumont, now Corwell campus. Every property on the street is developed except this 120 foot frontage. That's the leftover, which i.e. the infill project that we're proposing. And as has been mentioned by Mr. Murphy, infill projects require many times a little bit of assistance and we're asking for that. But we think we're also providing community benefits and I'll address that in a moment.  So this is, in fact, the last infill project in this area. And it is very consistent with the general development pattern that has occurred. And most of it, I would say the plurality, I can't say the majority, but the plurality of the buildings are multifamily. There are shops and stores and restaurants and doctor's offices and things of that nature also. And in fact,  On Greenfield, the two parcels south of us are significantly larger multifamily projects that have been in place for some time. So we also want to point out that between the two meetings, we made a number of significant changes to the project. First of all, listening to the neighbors who were nearby and some of their concerns.  We tried to address them as best we can. We reduced the number of units from 12 to 10. That increased our parking ratio to 1.6. And as you know, Royal Oak does have a requirement of two spaces, but many communities for one bedroom and studios, which is what we have, is only one space. So we believe we're providing a very solid ratio of 1.6 spaces for the types of units that will be deployed here.  We also have a six-foot masonry wall, not a wooden wall, so any light that may be coming from cars will not go into the neighboring properties. We also moved the dumpster from one side of the project to the other at the specific request of a neighbor. And we also added to this two additional trees to eight trees.  As Mr. Murphy mentioned, we do believe we comply with the community benefits. We're a small but environmentally sustainable project. We have 18 solar panels in place, which will be primarily used for the outdoor lighting, the exterior lighting. We have two EV charging stations, a rain garden,  Although it's not environmentally sustainable, we are putting in the stormwater detention system, which we always know needs to be done. We will be utilizing energy efficient appliances and we do have permeable pavers. So for a project of its modest size, I think we're trying the very best we can to comply with those sustainable features. I do want to add one comment about the trees. We are not asking a waiver. I believe  based upon the arborist and the city's arborist that the ordinance is not applicable to us. It says specifically healthy trees will be replaced. These are not healthy trees by any way, shape or form. Both the report and the, both the report and the,  City's own arborist is in agreement with that report and the ordinance says it's healthy trees. We're not, no one's to be assessed for unhealthy trees.  We're not trying to evade that. We're just trying to be fair about it. And we'll do the things we're required to do and beyond with community benefits. But I don't think they should be asked to replace trees that are unhealthy because that's not what your ordinance. And I think that's fair. The ordinance was clearly based on replacing healthy trees and we don't have that situation here.  That all being said, we're certainly here to answer any questions that you may have on any aspect of the project.",8175.477,8511.586,"""""",Other,Other,0,0

We see here an applicant who listened to comments from the public and comments from the Planning Commission and adapted their plan. The challenges of an infill site on a tiny little site like this are  I mean we've got a built up city and then you've got this little pocket and what are you going to do with it? And yet a property owner has the right to develop their property. And here I think we see a thoughtful development. We've heard from the public about  as if the city determines what multifamily gets built in this city and the city makes no such determinations. These projects are bought to us by developers and they're developing multifamily units that respond to market conditions. Our master plan, our more than 20 year old master plan, our zoning ordinance actually, specifies sizes of apartments that  people aren't renting anymore. That's not the demand. The demand is for smaller units, often individually occupied. And the same is true of our parking requirements that are set at two spots for apartment, assuming larger apartments than we're seeing here and elsewhere.

Not having been there from square one, I just want to make sure I'm seeing this accurately. So the entire east side of Greenfield from Albert to 13 Mile is almost exclusively multifamily. Is that right? High density multifamily.  This entire stretch of Greenfield. Okay. And we're talking about an intersection of 13 Mile and Greenfield, a major intersection between this long stretch of multifamily and a 711. Yep. All right. And we're talking about putting a development that totally conforms with that entire stretch of road. Okay. Okay.

The developer, as you said, aptly, has made substantial changes in response to public concern, also has hit the mark on many of our public benefits.  Directives. For 12 units. Right. Or 10. To me, this is not a tremendously desirable lot. No one is going to propose putting a single family home at the corner of 13 Mile and Greenfield. And it would be completely inappropriate for the city just to hold that property hostage by denying proposal after proposal until something comes in that does conform and would probably not be well loved.  by some of the neighbors anyway. This is a community priority to have multifamily meeting the needs of seniors, young families, and folks who don't necessarily are in a position to buy yet.

So I'm not understanding why this would be of grave concern. I think there's a narrative that we're plopping something right in the middle of a neighborhood. We're putting it right in a stretch that totally conforms with exactly what we're doing here anyway. Only this one comes with substantial environmental benefits proposed by the developers.

I had major concerns about the trees, but having the petitioners, arborists,  give an opinion about the condition of the trees and then the city's arborist confirming that with the exception of the two. I'm not in any position to refute that. I'm not an arborist, so I'll go with the opinion of the experts. And an additional concern was the parking. That has been well explained. But I think that this is a project that will benefit the community. It incorporates many of our community benefits.  items that we've included in our checklist. And it's in a position that will likely draw the attention of those that are working at Beaumont Hospital, or Cornwell, I'm so sorry, Cornwell Hospital, right down the road. The concern that many renters are transient, are gonna be in and out, and not really care about the city and, you know, our community, I, you know,  I'm highly offended by that because I have many family members and many friends who rent in this community and I think they're more engaged in the community than many people.  So that concern has no impact on my decision at all. So I like the project.

The development is the developers removing those trees that would otherwise disease these two trees but that's the only condition in which these two trees would continue to exist anyway according to our arborist.  So I think it's a reasonable concession to settle a dispute that's otherwise not really provable unless we remove all those other trees, leaving the two that are not yet diseased.

That 200 inch is 200 inch times 200 some, I think, $250.  An inch that we charge when you remove a tree and don't replace it is how they come up with $36,000. Subsequently from this report, they saw an arborist and we saw an arborist and they said, no, wait, those trees need to go anyways.
