JS_08_15_23,SPEAKER_34,"Good evening, everyone. I appreciate you giving me a couple of minutes here just to update you on the Sheriff's Office.  First and foremost, probably the jail. If you weren't aware, the millage didn't pass. So we did do a couple of repairs to the jail, one of which was the roof, which was badly in need of repair. It was leaking quite a bit. We were able to get that repaired for a little over $3,800. I was really excited about that. We got a two-year warranty on it as well. The radio system that was in the jail, which was  A safety issue for the corrections deputies was also repaired. That unfortunately took a little bit more money, about $214,000 in order to get a new antenna system and a couple of other relays inside of the jail for that to work properly. We still have plumbing leaks like we did before, and we're just fixing them as time goes along. Now, we did have a jail ad hoc committee that was meeting every month  on the same day as the public safety meetings that were taking place for the County Commission. And that's recently concluded. However, it has not been completely disbanded. There's still probably some work to be done there, but there is a recommendation.  going forward for approximately three quarters of a mil, so a quarter of a mil less than what we had asked for before to move forward with getting a new jail built. Real quickly, we had drug and violence summits that we partnered with the prosecutor's office. Of course, city police department was involved in that as well, Blackmon Township and the state police. Over 300 participants in the drug summit.  And I want to emphasize a couple of things here, because I think it's important for you to know. We were the first jail, albeit we were the first place in Michigan to have a NARCAN machine, a free NARCAN vending machine installed. This is a big deal. Now, a lot of places have taken stride into that and have instituted NARCAN machines, and we've actually instituted a couple of additional NARCAN machines at the health department here in the county.  but I want to point out some statistics to you that I think you'll find surprising and, um, uplifting. So the best comparison that we have is a 2020, uh, year, because that was prior to any Narcan machine, uh, in the County and 2021 about this time in 2021 is when we put our Narcan machine, uh, in the Wesley street jail, uh, and 2022, we have a fair comparison and apples to apples comparison with 2020.  to show us the decrease in opioid deaths and opioid overdoses. And why this is important is because folks that leave the jail that are addicted to drugs, and we have a lot of them, when they leave, they believe that their tolerance level is here when it actually is here. And that's when they're most vulnerable for an overdose. So what we do is encourage them to get the Narcan out of the machine. It's free.  Costs them nothing, it costs us nothing, except for the electricity that we plug into the wall for the machine. And they take that with them when they leave. Now, the statistics I'm gonna read you, I don't believe are wholly because of this Narcan machine, but I do believe that there is a strong correlation between it. So in 2020, we had 179 opioid-related overdoses in Jackson County.  We had 37 opioid-related deaths in Jackson County in 2020. In 2022, we had 72 opioid-related overdoses. That's 179 down to 72. And 12 opioid-related deaths. That's about a third. So I think it had a huge impact. I expect it's going to have an additional impact.  now that we've had additional machines throughout the county. But I wanted to share that with you because I think it's very important to show that we're combating this along with our drug summits and the different things that we've done. I think we've made some huge strides in our community. Real quickly, we had an open house on June 5th down on Wesley Street. It was very well attended, at least 1,000 people. Everybody says, well, how do you know it was 1,000 people? Because I gave out 1,000 hot dogs.  So that's why I say at least 1,000 people. I didn't eat one, and I was there. So very well attended. We're going to make that an annual event. And we recently just instituted a canine program. We're in a process right now of examining a dog with a veterinarian to make sure that everything is OK with the dog. And that dog is a really good tracking animal, something that we really need, especially in a county. We have a lot of folks that wander away that are dementia patients.  And we also have a lot of autistic children that have wandered away. And this canine is really going to be beneficial to make sure that those people are kept safe. In addition to that, we're instituting a canine program in the county jail. It's going to assist us with narcotics and other contraband that comes into the jail as well. One of the things that hampers us right now is the physical limitations of the building. We can't put in  all of the equipment, the modern equipment that we need to be able to search folks when they come through. Even a strip search doesn't catch everything. I'll leave that to your imagination as to how it gets in. But a dog really helps in those encounters, especially when we're going into cells and we're doing searches. So I think this is going to be a very positive thing for our community and especially for our jail. That's all that I have. I wanted to make this quick. Thank you so much for your time. I know you got a big night.  But I'm happy to answer questions if you have any. Perfect. I'm going to head on out to the county commission meeting. It's nice seeing you all. Thank you very much.

JS_08_15_23,SPEAKER_09,"All right, Leanne Robinson, 815 Wildwood Avenue. Dear City Council and City Assessor, I am writing in regards to assessment row 3435 for Grinnell Street, Norfolk to Wildwood. I am most definitely object to this proposal for reconstruction and water main replacement.  I cannot afford to pay for a road that I would never travel. Sure, my home is located on the corner of Wildwood and Grinnell, but I never used that street. And I just recently had to have the sewer line to my home repaired at a price of $6,785. And the repair was done  on the Grinnell Street side. So now you want to fix the street and the water main and charge me $14,883.40. I am a homeowner here and I pay my property taxes on time seasonally. I am retired and live on a budget and I feel like I'm being taken advantage of because I own my home. If someone on Grinnell Street wants to fix the road,  Let them pay for it. Or why can't the city of Jackson pay for it? It is wrong to charge me and others for this. There are other roles that need repair. Maybe this letter won't make a difference, but honestly, I cannot afford this ridiculous price. If you can please figure out another way to fix this other than charging homeowners for this. Sincerely. Christie Maynard. 225 North Grinnell St.  To whom it may concern, I am writing this email in protest for the street reconstruction and water main replacement on Grinnell Street, Norfolk to Wildwood. My husband and I live at 225 North Grinnell Street. We have been homeowners here for three years. We have both worked at paid taxes in Jackson for the past decade, and we continue to watch our taxes go up. Where is that paid tax money going? Where is the tax money for all of the marijuana dispensaries around town going?  all for bettering our home, our town, but why am I to pay tax to a city and state only to be billed for what I already pay for? We do not have $6,600 to give, nor do we want, nor do we make enough a year to pay an extra 650 plus annually for the next 10 years with interest on top of what we pay now to own a home in Jackson.  We understand that the driving force behind this project is the doctor's office on our street. This doctor has tried to buy out all of our homes on North Grinnell Street to extend his business in the past few years. We also don't feel that we should be required to partially fund his business improvements and expansion. We appreciate you taking the time to read this email. Milmat Properties, LLC,  for 206 North Grinnell Street. They said, I hereby register my objection, August 11, 2023.

To my knowledge, we are now the longest living family on this street. Thank you. Is that better? Can everyone hear?  Once again, to my knowledge, we are the oldest family on this street now because the doctor has bought out most everyone else, even the diamond tax services. They're gone now. And they were there prior to us. I spoke with Laura on the phone for a half an hour or 45 minutes over this. She emailed me the protest papers because of my scheduling. I didn't have time to actually come down here and get them myself.  Now because the doctor's business owns over half of the street now, there's no way we can protest this. Because I missed it by two for the private residents. One of the gentlemen is here that signed the papers also. According to the emails, we now have all eight in protest of this. Now because the doctor owns most of this street, the majority of the bill is going to him. To my calculations, which unfortunately I don't have in front of me,  You're looking at about $160,000 roughly of the 180-some assessment that our road is. Why don't you just give the bill to him since it's his project and his business to begin with that started this whole thing? Yes, prior to,  The road didn't need to be repaired, but there has been so much damage to that road now because of heavy equipment and his construction, that it should be his responsibility. Because I don't know how you guys were raised, but I was raised that if you cause the damage, you pay the bill. So I don't know what most of the other residents have on their assessment, but mine is almost $11,000.  I haven't done the math as to what this would do to my tax bill, but it would be up there. It would be a very hard fight for me to keep my home at this point, especially living there for almost 40 years. I grew up in that home.

These property owners, homeowners on these streets that are being assessed thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars, that's unnecessary.

For the most part, saying the same thing, that they could not afford the thousands and thousands of dollars in street assessments.  They turned a corner. That's a very, very good thing. And it's due to the citizens of Jackson, especially those on these streets that are being overly assessed. Take note. Back in 2015, when we began to improve the downtown here with Dig Downtown, that was, I believe, a multimillion dollar project.  Each one of those property owners right out here on West Michigan Avenue was not assessed one dime for this new street out here. Money was spent from the major street fund, the local street fund, the water enterprise fund, the sewer enterprise fund for this nice new downtown, which we all agree is very nice, and that's due to the vision of our former city manager, Patrick Birch.  agree with it or not, that downtown is nice.

JS_08_15_23,SPEAKER_04,"Maria Garcia Santana, 702 First Street. Cheryl, would you like to stand up here with me? All right.  We were successful in our petition because people like Cheryl were willing to sign it and share their stories with me. So this is your success as well. I hope that your vote reflects the hard work that we all did on this. I'm going to read my comments because I can really go off track here.  There's a great opposition from the community of 28 homeowners who will need to share the burden of $173,365 to cover the expenses for roll number 3428. Residents like businesses and local governments are still recovering from the COVID crisis, as well as record high inflation, making this a financial burden for all involved. When I was here on July 11th, I had 17 questions and concerns.  The primary being, will people lose their homes if they can't pay the special assessment? Since then, I received an answer to that question and was told that yes, if people cannot pay the special assessment, they could potentially lose their homes. I thought I was maybe being a little hysterical or over the top. After hearing all of the folks today and last, in July, I realized that this is a very real fear for the residents.  including us. If you are not familiar with the stretch of Burr Street, it is a community of working poor, retirees, disabled individuals, pensioners, and the elderly living on Social Security. What started out for me as an exercise against the special assessment for personal financial reasons has become a mission to prevent people from potentially losing their homes.  Sometimes people are unaware of what the city is asking of them Since July 11th, I met with the city manager the city assessor and an engineer They made an attempt to answer my questions and I appreciate their insights and their time I still had my concerns and started the petition process I was told that they have to look out for what's best for the city of Jackson and not individuals What is the city if not its residents?  There is a story behind every signature. Some people shared their stories as to why this assessment would be a hardship, while others were grateful for the opportunity to sign it and did so eagerly. I grew up on Burr Street. The houses are old. It is not the prettiest neighborhood in Jackson. Some need work, and that's hard to do on a fixed and limited income. For my part, I would rather spend my money putting that back into the house.  I know that Jackson has a couple of projects going on that include additional homes and beautification and neighborhood improvement projects. How great would it be to keep people in their homes as the city builds up around them? Mayor Mahoney, in the summer issue of the Jackson Newsletter, you were quoted as saying,  Quote, I called on the city leaders to work together on a realistic plan to fix the streets that doesn't rely on special assessments, end quote. I hope that your vote reflects that sentiment today. In closing, I'm pleading with Mayor Mahoney, the administrators, and city council members to find ways to pay for this project without tapping into the funds of Jackson residents living paycheck to paycheck. Thank you so much for hearing us.",12618,12849,"""""",Public Hearing,Commenter,0,1

Not until Jackson has a mayor that will tell the public the truth on how serious gang activity is in Jackson, these gangs will continue their violent lawlessness in our city.

Turns out that providing hot dogs, hugs, and face painting to hardened criminals  did not put a dimple, let alone a dent, in gang violence. Here's just a few things wrong with the GVI. The funding for this came from a one-time massive federal money drop on Jackson called ARPA. ARPA funds were like the money you might get when a rich aunt dies. You manage them very carefully because I guarantee you she's not going to die again.  Maybe the biggest problem with this program is what we're seeing here tonight is all the people who showed up tonight who are not gangbangers, the people who pay their house and income taxes and skyrocketing water bills in full and on time being hit with $8,000, $10,000, $12,000 street assessments. With the money squandered on GVI, with that money, almost 200 individual $8,000 street assessments could have been covered in full.  Or 300 homeowners could have had their street assessments cut in half. Or another approach, 560 homeowners could have had a third of their street assessments paid for, but that money was spent on GVI instead. Number three, does anyone believe for a single minute that gang violence can be addressed by a mayor, council, and police chief who will not even use the term gang violence, but use the term group violence instead?

Those bathrooms over there were only used I think the first maybe year or six months of when they were put in and then they were closed.

If there's a problem with having the bathrooms open, the city should have thought of that before they put that money into that. Their reasoning was to bring outdoor bathrooms back into Jackson.  You put it there and then you close it. You lock the doors. When there are events held down here in the city of Jackson, those bathrooms should be open to the people, to the vendors, to whoever comes and participate in the city of Jackson's events that are happening. I mean, porta-potties are good, but I personally don't care for them. Those two bathrooms over there, they should be used.  They should be open. The city put them there. The city should be paying for the public works or whoever to maintain them. We should not have to get additional port-a-potties because the city spent money the wrong way.

I think citizen comments are important because it is one place where we can speak to our council, and we will know that you may hear us.  I do think there are a few issues with citizen comments. Some ways they could be improved and I think this is something the City Council could do. Citizen comments are not very accessible. They require personal attendance. They require public speaking skills. They are only available two times per month. Council could improve this in several different ways.  However, each way would be costly, time-consuming, and distracting from all the important things you already have to do. I have the free time.

I am here about item 1111, the change in the program guidelines for the 100 homes program. In  The memo from the city staff, they identified one non-profit submission on the RFP. That was us, Community Action Agency. We submitted it in partnership with Habitat for Humanity. Our submission for the RFP was expensive because we built in services for three full years. We don't know that it'll take three years to find 100 eligible homeowners, but that's how we built  how we built our project. I think it's unfortunate that the value of the nonprofits that we would provide for this program was dismissed because of expense without a discussion of possible options. It also seems like there's an assumption that we already get paid to do these services so we can serve additional clients in homebuyer education. CAA does not receive $300 per person who attends homebuyer education from MSHDA.  CAA receives a total of $45,000 between HUD and MSHDA housing counseling grants to provide housing counseling services in three counties. We have HUD-certified housing counselors that are able to provide the required services for MSHDA down payment assistance. We assist families in getting prepared to purchase through credit counseling, financial management, and homebuyer education. We are well-versed in walking families through this process.  appreciate the city staff in the Community Development Department and all the work that they do but I do believe that they have misjudged the amount of work that it will take to find a hundred eligible buyers in the 60 to 80 percent AMI price range.

I want to speak to the gun violence real quick and note that in Ann Arbor, one of the cities that is one of the 50 best small towns to live in in the United States, they have had 12 homicides since June 1st. We've had three all year.  Now, gun violence is difficult for the police. They come, as you notice after you read, after it has happened or while it is ongoing. They are not there beforehand. They cannot take these guns away from people beforehand because of both our Constitution and the stupidity of our legislators and Congress who have not dealt with this issue. That's all I have to say on that. I want to talk about  some other things. Patrick Birch was raised. Patrick Birch and Derek Dobies demolished almost 1,500 homes in Jackson. Freddie, you voted for every one of those demolitions. Those demolished homes were the housing that the poor people who are now, you know, you're building affordable housing, one of the mayor's initiatives, you're taking care of the homeless. Well, where do you think  happened to the affordable housing. You tore it down, Freddie, and you were on the board of realtors at the time. And I think you're also on  the Chamber of Commerce Executive Board. And the Chamber of Commerce, Jackson was the only Chamber of Commerce I know that did not support marijuana development. And Freddie is the one who's opposed to marijuana development. Now, the only township got $500,000 kickback from the state in their taxes. That could be used toward your assessments.  That would be another pool. That was jobs that would have been available to the people on the east side. That whole east Michigan Avenue, you go to another city and you'll see four, five, six of the old buildings remodeled, refurnished, and their marijuana dispensaries or other marijuana related industries. So Freddie, you've been an impediment  And you've created the problems we're facing and then I go to a meeting of the Homeless Council and I hear that we're going to deal with the homeless from November 1st to March 31st.  I'm telling you, Freddie, homeless people, the problems they face on the street don't start on November 1st, and they don't end on March 31st. I would like the city to address this year-wide problem. I have to go down to Consumers Park, I have to call the police chief four or five times in that two-week period to remove homeless people who are living there.  That is public property. That is not private squatters' rights. Let's do something about this. Thank you, Chief Hitt.",14813,15002,"""""",Public Comment,Commenter,1,0

There is issues with consumer protections. So like, I wish Kyle Wabe would have stayed. But yeah, the reason why we can't use the bathrooms anymore is because they're being used for stuff that they're not supposed to be used for. Drug dealing, prostitution, people shitting up there. These policies, a lot of them were promoted previously by Derek Dobes, who's here right now.  As sort of a solution, needle programs as a solution to sort of decrease overdoses and to keep needles off the street and allow people to use, I guess, whatever addicted substances they're on in a more safe way. And the exact opposite of that is what is happening. The Reed Manor found an employee dead inside of one of the customer's apartments and the customer was dead too. They had both died from an overdose.  Derek Dobies is on the news smiling, holding, or shaking somebody's hand to install a needle program on the Reed Manor property. Previously, the homeless shelter was used to sort of pilot the needle programs and not rocket have skyrocketed since then. Almost all of the 911 calls in Jackson County are in the city. And of the calls in the city, a majority of them go to nonprofit organizations.  for things like overdoses, drug dealing, labor weapons, sex, drug trafficking. These are important issues and a lot of this stuff, you know, the Republican Party many years ago attempted to address this through sort of a legal way to change the way that businesses in America could operate and installing sort of a  safer business practices, ending things like obviously human trafficking as a priority. Right here in Jackson, I see that the MLK Corridor Improvement Authority is using this to sort of market itself, the history of the Republican Party, but Jackson didn't really stick to that path of trying to protect consumers from bad business practices. Things like these needle programs are a bad business practice. They don't work.  And Kyle was totally right to be upset that he's paying money for part of the park, which he can't use for his event. And a lot of people have questions about why we can't use these things. But, I mean, we really should be addressing, like, what are the ideas that are being promoted to city council members or political parties or non-profit organizations in Jackson?  Are they actually good ideas? And are they legitimate? Is what they're saying true? So like Community Action Agency, they get $25 million a year in funding. They do have enough money, and it is their job that they have chosen to take on to address things like homeowner education, things like that. But here they are making excuses, saying that they're financially insolvent. So stuff's not really adding up. Thank you for your time.",15017,15208,"""""",Public Comment,Commenter,1,0

Pete Schwigerot with Pivotal at 9100 Center Point Drive in Westchester, Ohio, here to speak about the Blackstone. It's an item on your agenda here shortly.  I don't envy you for your work, but I admire you for your work. It is truly public servant work and I'm sure everyone here is doing the best they can and making the decisions they think are best for the community. So thank you for putting in the time and thank you for listening to me.  We were here several times regarding the Blackstone and another project, the Greenwood, helping to develop new, high quality, affordable housing in your community. Certainly those projects have been slightly delayed, mostly because of economic challenges and the cost inflation that we've experienced over the last three years. When we started the Blackstone,  to the time where we could construct the Blackstone. COVID-related inflation has brought an additional $3 million in cost to the development. So that has slowed us down a little bit. Never fret. We scratch and call and find ways to fill those gaps, and fortunately  We found those gaps now, so we are targeting a closing on what will be a 53-unit affordable housing development at the corner of Pearl and Blackstone. Those units will target up to 80% AMI. There's a variety of bandwidths in there, so we're about to serve the low- to moderate-income families in your community with a high-quality, brand-new house, home that will include anything and everything you would expect in your own home. They're built to green standards.  They're 100% accessible, so we're really excited about serving your community with that. Two pieces of legislation in front of you. First is a development agreement that assures we follow through on all the commitments that we've committed to the administration. The other is a purchase agreement, and it's essentially just an extension of the option we've already had, and we'll materialize that into a more formal contract for closing. We hope that will happen.  in early October. I'm sorry, September. September, early to mid-September is our goal. We have a lot of great partners in this and there's still a lot of work to do as we finalize the closing, but approving these two documents will set us up to be able to close on that pace. We certainly thank you for your time and look forward to being further owners here in Jackson. Thanks again.",15216,15375,"""""",Public Comment,Commenter,1,0

JS_08_15_23,SPEAKER_40,"Good evening everyone. My name is Sheila Everts and I'm the Executive Director of Greater Jackson Habitat. We're located at 251 West Prospect. I am here today to talk about the 100 homes. The City Council will vote on the City staff to facilitate the 100 homes.  Community Action Agency and Habitat joined together, as you guys heard earlier, in a joint effort to respond to the RFP that was released. We both have proven programs to serve under 80% AMI and below. However, the RFP exceeded the cost expectancy.  Therefore, we are not awarded nor allowed to discuss how we could be part of this program. Based on the information we have, it sounds like developers were offered the opportunity to negotiate options. We have served this community for 34 years and CA for over 50. We have a proven track record of providing affordable homes to our community.  which includes financial education, homebuyer education, and wraparound services. Toby spoke earlier about community action agency and these services also. In addition, Habitat has a few lenders that will give mortgages to these homeowners below market rate and lower credit scores.  During the past six months, I've worked closely with the city to assist and give my 20 years of experience on how we could facilitate this program. In addition, Habitat has received over 170 applications for this program at our own expense because we believed in this program. To achieve the 100 homes, approximately 2,000 applications will be needed, even though we're a non-profit, our costs should still be covered.  So before you vote tonight, I want you guys to consider some questions. Who is selling a lot to qualified homebuyers? Are the cities or the developers? Who's paying for closing costs with the title company? What is the budget cost for the city to facilitate this program? Who will do the financial education and homebuyer class? Will the homeowners pay for this, or will CAA, Community Action Agency, be expected to cover this cost and the increase in their class enrollment?  who represent the buyers for the purchases of these homes. The program is for 60 to 80% AMI. And for my opinion, 75 to 80% AMI will qualify currently, but have under 60 to 75% of AMI applicants will have to be eligible for layers of funding if they're not using a nonprofit organization. This comes to my last question.  Example of the property tax saving for the homeowners. As a non-profit, the law states that new homeowner property taxes is based on their mortgage amount and not on their sales price. So if someone was to have a mortgage of $150,000, their tax base is about $45,000. If it's $130,000, it's $3,300. $4,500. Yes. The beacon was getting to me. Thank you, Sheila.

Because I know for other events, park staff has come and changed out trash and helped out at the event. And I know that we do that for other events.  And that was kind of my request. I know it's an additional cost, but I did reach out to John Willis, and I know he's at a county commission meeting right now, so I don't know how much communication he's had with Kyle.  Um, but I did reach out to John Willis and say, Hey, is there something that we can do, um, from the, from the, uh, equity and diversity office, uh, to, to assist with this, this roadblock, um, that may not actually be a roadblock, but just kind of like enforcement of the, of the rules. So, so I'm hopeful that we can, that we can help figure something out. Um, especially because I know that we provide that assistance for other events in the community.  where parks and facilities would come out and actually change the trash so it's not overflowing. Because I think it's a kind of an unrealistic expectation for while an event is going on, if trash is overflowing, for them to change it. Because like, where would they take it to? There's not a public dumpster in the downtown area that they would be able to take that trash to. And then for restrooms, I kind of agree with the same thing. Like, we've got restrooms.  they're not accessible, but I totally understand why, um, that I would much rather hear the complaints of the dollars that were spent, um, prior to me being here, uh, important to know, um, uh, on that bathroom that's down there. But the, the, the, the reality is, um, terrible things happen behind closed doors. Um, and I would rather err on the side of safety. Um,  than to open restrooms, but I do think it may be a good idea for us to consider if during like public events, that those bathrooms are able to be unlocked and utilized for specific timeframes, um, during public events, um, and during times where the sun is still up.

JS_08_15_23,SPEAKER_28,"Okay.  Well, my expectations were that it wouldn't get voted on today, but I wanted to get it on the table. And the reason I wanted to was I've knocked on over 1,500 doors this summer, and I was on Bourke Street, I was on Arnold, I didn't knock on, I only knocked on one door on Arnold, but, or two on Arnold, but,  this community can't afford those $10,000 assessments. And this changing it to 12.5% to SEV would cut those in half. And most of the people that I talked to, I didn't talk to 1,500, I talked to over 500, most people acknowledge that they are and are willing to help participate in the cost of our roads, but they need, as this council has heard, they need time to plan.  for that, and so I think an overall plan for our roads would help. They need, and it needs to contribute to the value of their house, and being a realtor, I couldn't add $10,000 to the value of a house on Burr Street in the sections that these assessments were, and cost just, they wouldn't get that back. Now I recognize there's different ways of value. I had an extensive conversation with Jason,  I think it was two hours, I thought it'd be 45 minutes. And I understand where he's coming from on the value as of one unit versus a front foot. And I agree with him that when I sell a house, the yard being bigger or the street frontage sometimes might add, sometimes might distract, but most of the time it's just a feature, it's not necessarily increasing the value of the property.  There's many reasons that I think it's time for us to take a look at this and analyze it, tear it apart, and come up with an equitable way of charging for assessments. I believe in assessments over taxing a millage because a millage will never go away. In the long run, it will cost our citizens more.  and you're paying for the work when it's done as opposed to all of the time and non-profits participate in the cost of the construction of the road as opposed to if it's a millage they do not. So I would like to see this policy fine-tuned so that our citizens can more easily afford  helping us with our roads and getting them done. So that's why I put it here. And that's why I'm suggesting a 12 and a half because it would be half of what, what you saw on the documents today in most cases, but we have to look at caps and whether it's commercial versus residential, yada, yada, yada. So I would like to adjust my, Oh no, you need to speak. I'm sorry. Mayor.",16938,17119,"""""",Other,Other,0,0
JS_08_15_23,SPEAKER_07,"Thank you. So I had what was supposed to be a lunch meeting turned into, I think, almost a three and a half hour meeting with Jason as well. And I appreciate the thoroughness of him being able to go through and explain everything. Where I struggle at is  how it's going to impact the citizens. Um, and that's, that's my biggest struggle. I mean, looking at the charts, looking at the way we do front footage right now, I know it's a simpler, easier way to think about doing assessment evaluations, um, per unit instead of like how we do it now. Uh, front footage. Um, however, I'm looking at the impact that it is going to have.  Right now, with the motion on the floor, I would be an absolute no. I mean, like you said, citizens just told us they can't afford the assessments that they are getting. And from what I look at in this, and until I can see something different, what I look at in this and the charts that have been provided, the way I'm looking at this, it is going to be an increase for individuals who have a smaller current assessment  on front footage versus per units gonna increase their amount. And that I just, I'm struggling with very, very tough. It'd be one thing if the chart showed that in like fewer cases that happens, but it seems pretty consistent that individuals who have larger front footage, which I've bought a house and I've looked at property and I know the more property you have, the higher the cost of the house is.  So while it may not add any value, the front footage of the road itself, if my yard's larger than my neighbor's yard, I'm probably going to be able to sell my house for more than they would. That I just think is true just based off of the fact that they're not making any more property in the United States of America or any country for that matter. I don't know anybody who's able to make more land.  So I think that's one thing that we have to look at, is how is this going to impact our citizens? I understand it being easier, easier to formulate, unless there's something that's going to show me that this is going to decrease, and maybe it's that 12.5% that you're talking about, maybe it's lowering the special assessment cap, which right now I believe is at $15,000.  for residential properties, maybe lowering that cap to guarantee that it would be lower would be something, and lowering that percentage would be something to consider. But I would need to see it, I would need to be able to see it tangibly in how it's going to impact some of the projects. Because as of right now, what it looks like it's going to do is it's going to lower the cost for individuals who have larger properties.  and increase the cost for individuals who have smaller properties. That I cannot stand behind. Unfortunately, I would be a hard no on this, just like I was when it was brought up the last time. And I know part of the reason that it was kind of delayed is we were trying to get a time where our assessor and I could catch up and kind of go through this in more detail. But to me, I'm having a very, very difficult time seeing how this would actually positively benefit  our citizens. If that can be shown to me, if I'm missing something, then us waiting would be a good idea, because I would like to see how this is going to positively benefit the citizens in some way when it comes to the assessments. Because as it stands right now, and I've got one, two, three, four, like five different charts that I've looked at, and in every single example, it increases  for individuals who have a smaller amount, and it decreases for individuals who have a larger amount. It also places a cap on commercial properties, and I know that people buy commercial properties to make money, and I understand that. However, I'm struggling really hard for, like, if there's a commercial property that has, let's say, like 40 or 50  individual units that are being like they got to pay rent and that 40 or 50 unit property having a cap of $30,000. Let's say like right at the corner of Kibbe and West Staff, right? And then right next door to there, a citizen who is a single family homeowner right next door, their cap is $15,000. Right now there isn't a cap on commercial properties.  I can't stand behind that either because I have a really hard time looking someone in the face who's a single family homeowner and saying, your cap's 15,000, but this multi-unit next to it is 30,000. That's really difficult for me. So unless there's something that I'm missing or something different, unfortunately, I'll be a no on this. I'll be a no on this. There's parts of it that I think that would benefit,  the lowering of the cap for the residential property, the lowering of that, that percentage, uh, rate for the, the, the state equalized, uh, uh, value of the assessed property. Those items, I can see how that would benefit. But the overall concept of going from front foot to per unit, I don't see how that's going to benefit our citizens at all.",17121,17468,"""""",Other,Other,0,0

JS_08_15_23,SPEAKER_02,"Good evening council. Thank you. I believe a PDF of this file to address your concerns. Council approved $300,000 for an RFP to handle the administrative cost of administering the 100 homes program. The RFP came in around 1.9 million.  Some of the specific questions here. Who's selling lots to qualified homeowners? The lots are being turned over to the builders, they're buying the lots from the city. The developers are incurring the entire cost, incurring the cost, building the house on spec, there's no cost output by the city for the build of the house. Who's paying for the closing cost at the title company? The buyer, like most every sale.  What is the budgeted cost for Citi to facilitate? Corey worked out some numbers. He put it at about $320,000, but that's on the high end. Who will do the financial education homebuyer classes? Will the homeowner pay for them? CA cannot be expected to cover the cost. These are online Zoom classes. We can direct people to MSU Extension if need be for $25.  They can do it online or they can go to CAA's site and jump online. It's offered once a month via Zoom. Who will represent the purchaser of the home? If the purchaser wants to get a real estate agent and they feel that they need one, they can pay that additional cost to the real estate agent out of their own pocket on the closing. You just tack it on to the cost of the house, I guess.  But I can tell you that the builders aren't going to take it out of their pocket. They're building these with a certain margin of profit, and they wouldn't be here today if they weren't making the margin. The program is for 60% to 80% AMI. Only 75% to 80% can qualify. Several layers. Well, we can expect that some people might have to come to the table with some money out of pocket. These houses are affordable houses, some of the most affordable ever being built in our community. We're not going to be able to check every box for everybody.  Just being honest, 100 homes, $25,000 from us, $10,000 from the state. That's $35,000 on a $175,000 bill that's being built for $190,000 and sold for $190,000 in our community. People are going to walk in and have $50,000 in equity walking in. I think that's a pretty good deal. Not going to check every box. So I worked out, I did look at the RFP pretty close. 100 homes closing, that's four closings per month, one closing per week.  22,000 people that we need into the queue to get 100 buyers. That's four people per day that we can accept into our queue. I've got a qualified person can go through that, shuffle out to people who don't qualify. We can do a pre-call on our own. We've already got the system built. Then we've already got relationships with lenders. We can say, here's a group of lenders, customer, go choose the lender you want. So we were a little struck by  The RFP wanted two full-time equivalents, one part-time. I've got two staff that are going to put time into this and they're going to probably allocate sometimes 10% per day of their day, sometimes 50, sometimes 100, just depends. But the bottom line, I've got four closings per month, one closing per week, 2,000 people to put through in 500 days worth of work days.  That's assuming people work five days a week, 10 days off a year, that's 250 days they'd be working. That's four people a day to kind of sift through their paperwork, see if we should push them on. Make sure they have their certificate from MSU Extension or another qualified...  Facility, we've got a couple others here. Lansing, Crites Road, Zeeb Road in Ann Arbor. We've got ways to get people trained up on getting their certificate to get first-time homebuyer. So, are there any questions? I feel like you're irritated with us.

We'll echo what Shane said in that I think the amount of staff time that's been put into this has been  substantial, and that's not stated as a negative, but really more of a positive. I think my kids are probably bored to tears that this is all we talk about at dinner every night. The level of excitement from me, from Shane, from our staff, it's really substantial. The ability for this project to have  I think one of the most meaningful impacts that we've been able to be a part of in a long time is not lost on staff, nor myself. I think Mayor Mahoney, you said at one point, this combined with some of the other housing initiatives will construct more homes than have been constructed since World War II. And that's a sound bite that we use, but it's a reality that we keep in the front of our heads.  To speak to this program guideline change in particular, we love our nonprofits dearly. They serve our community exceptionally well and they serve us as a city. They're good stewards of our CDBG funds, in some cases our home funds, in some cases other funds that we receive. We have an amazing relationship with them. In this particular case, I think we would have loved numbers that  We could have done a little more with I think we really, really love the opportunity to partner with a nonprofit. But at the end of the day we recognize that we need to be good stewards of these ARPA funds, that's our job as city staff. And I think, I think the city has done an amazing job utilizing their ARPA funds so far. I think Councilwoman Schleich to your point, we are, we are beyond grateful.  that council has gone with us in this journey. Sometimes it felt like we were building the plane as we fly it, and that's because we've got a tight timeline with our funds. But I think we're really grateful that council has stood behind the 100 homes concept, the two and a half million dollars to down payment assistance. That's a huge number. And the ability that it has to transform this community one family at a time, one neighborhood at a time is really huge. And so  So, looking at the ability to administer this program, nonprofit-wise versus in-house-wise, we really felt like we could be slightly better stewards of these ARPA funds if we administered in-house. And this was not an easy choice, frankly. I mean, it was time and time to sit down and go over this.  is it possible? How will it work? What will it look like? You know, Shane talked about staff capacity and our allocations and just how that work will get done. We've got a new staff member that will help, of course, but really sitting down and having honest conversations with the staff, can we do this? And the answer was unequivocally, yes. Not just my pie in the sky excitement, which you can probably hear,  but realistically looking at it and saying yes, we can do right by this project, we can administer these funds, we can do a great job at it, and we can really bring this project to the finish line. I'm excited, frankly, selfishly, I'm excited to have the opportunity to continue this internally. I'm super pleased with the support.

Um, at the same time as we have been doing, um, myself and I think quite a few other individuals, um, in the room were able to attend a meeting that was held, um, and hosted, held at the American one. Um,  American one building over at the fairgrounds that was hosted by, um, uh, Martha first and all from American one to, to, to begin some discussion on, on doing some development on the east side of the city. Um, and from a, from a city perspective, I think like considering, um, the impact that I know that the MLK corridor is going to make a net portion of the city, um, which is, uh, uh,  essentially a corridor like just like this could be for the east side. Um, I think from a city perspective, it would be a good idea for us to consider, um, having an east side corridor. Um, it's, it's much needed. Um, I live literally right between the south side and the east side. Um, and many of the needs that are present on the south side are also present on the east side as far as need for additional development to happen.

We should know what we're going to do from the railroad station to the east. Um, and then the DDA goes over to just pass the hospital. So it, um, I believe the DDAs focus and Freddie can sits on that board so he can confirm that they were going to, um,  start their focusing on that.

No,  I said, well, no love, nothing has been shown in the past about DDA towards the east side and DDA cover a lot. I know I look at the corridor, just where would it run? We have some discussion, where would it be? But I think I always thought that there's always been a great time for development there.  have had conversation, had talked with potential business owners. I know a lot of people say Wiley, but I think there's more opportunities on East Michigan, more than just Wiley, but he has a lot.  Um, so, yeah, we just started this conversation. I think that since we work with the M. I. K. Quarter, this be a have that experience. We can look into the maybe a quarter on the east side of business or some kind of business, a quarter of just looking at development, have more discussion with that. So I don't know. I just frustrated with D. D. A.",22320,22431,"""""",Other,Other,0,0
JS_08_15_23,SPEAKER_07,"But there's no secret. From what I gather from the conversation, many of the business owners in that strip that's between the train tracks and the hospital don't feel a part of the downtown area. And I think that many of the citizens in the community  don't even look at that as part of the downtown area because it is a clear cutoff from unfortunately, um, urban renewal when the state building was put to literally cut Michigan Ave off. Right. Um, like who made that decision? Cause that didn't make any sense. Um, you said who? A former mayor. I threw up and I read the article. I was going to say something, but I'm going to hold that comment.  Um, but yeah, I think that was unfortunate because that, that really, that really kind of ended in the opportunity for that portion to be included. Um, and I think that it, I think it would be one, we can have plenty of discussion. I think if, you know, a study could be done. Um, but I know for MLK corridor, um, part of that, what like, as far as like a study was part of the process of going through the creation of that corridor.  Um, one thing I know for sure is that the interest is there. Um, Lori, did you attend that meeting? I think we were there at the same time. I know Jonathan attended. I know, uh, Freddie attended. I'm not sure if any other council members were able to make that meeting. But as I sat there, what I, what I looked at is this is the body of like invested, interested individuals that could be the East side corridor.  it definitely would take some conversation with the DDA. Uh, cause I understand that we would definitely need to look at like how that would impact the DDA. Um, if that portion were to change, but there's more than just that strip from the Coney's down to the hospital that those citizens are also concerned about. Um, I think this would also be in, uh, I'm, I'm of the mind that it's better to like invite people in, um,  for change to happen than to exclude people. Um, and, and we all know that the lion's share of that portion is owned by one individual. One thing I'm not for is like trying to penalize someone, um, to get them to move on their own property. Right. Cause they, like they, they bought that property, they acquired it, they own it. Um, and like what they do with it is frankly their prerogative. And I think unfortunately we haven't built,  strong enough relationships with some of those individuals, and they may be a little sour with the city, but this is an opportunity for us to pull them in, figure out what it's going to take for them to get some of their properties back on the roads and back being used.  Um, and an opportunity for us to have another group focusing solely on that particular part of the community. Um, because to me that, that East side loop as far as like having discussions of where it could stretch to, could go from, um, from that across the train tracks area, Coney's down Michigan app to like Elm come back across  to Ganson and come back down Ganson. I don't know if that's too large of an area, because there's all kinds of nuances that you have to take into consideration when you're creating a TIF zone, and I'm not an expert in that. But I think that's why we would have this group.  designed to be able to go down that road because even if it couldn't immediately include that area in that area and I think it would lighten the load of the DDA and having them have to stretch their focus outside of where they're focused at currently. So that's my opinion. I wish I could have invited some of the individuals who were at that meeting  Um, but they are all in full support. We've got a lot of powerhouses who are in full support of us moving in this direction to create some type of east side corridor.",22433,22684,"""""",Other,Other,0,0
JS_08_15_23,SPEAKER_12,"Mr. Mayor. Yes, sir. Um, so I'd like to agree with everything you said. I want to put some of it into context too. Um, so I agree that the DDA hasn't shown a lot of love to the east side of the city. I hasn't shown a lot of love anywhere. And, um,  It's through no fault of their own. It's the fault of that giant parking deck next to consumers. That's where all of their money has gone for the last 23 years, and it's going to stop going, at least the vast majority of that, in two years. So if you look at our budget, in two years, the majority of those bonds will be paid off, and the DDA is looking at multiple millions of dollars that they're going to have in revenue, in TIF revenue, that used to pay for those parking decks, they're going to have annually.  millions of dollars a year. So I agree that I think past the hospital, I think this is a great idea. I think the DDA is gonna be a reinvigorated and a totally new DDA. Um, sooner than we realize.

Even though they're down at Dwight, Dwight isn't any less important than the rest of East Michigan Avenue.  I mean, maybe what you look at is the redrawing of the lines of the DDA.",22795,22827,"""""",Other,Other,0,0
JS_08_15_23,SPEAKER_18,"All ideas tonight for this topic have been really good ideas. There are some nuances with everything. Redrawing the lines has a fair bit of nuances with the TIF legislation. The bonds being paid has a good opportunity, but there's nuance to that with the TIF plan.  Because that may need to be amended, and the taxing jurisdictions may have an opportunity to opt out. So there's some nuance to everything. I think first and foremost, though, I was at the American One meeting. I've been DDA director. I was at their last meeting and go to their meetings regularly where they talk about the east side.  I think first and foremost, the city should start having some meetings over there because before we talk about where we want to go, quite frankly, the city's got some lumps it needs to take. The people and the businesses over there need to have an opportunity to tell us how we've screwed up for the past 30 or 40 years to get it off their chest. The only way we're going to move forward and coalesce around any plan is if we can get the real stakeholders, the property owners,  Into a meeting and to let them talk and let them tell us their experiences because we have some great ideas up here But we need to listen more than we speak right now. And I think if it's if it's left up to me Would would have some Some they wouldn't be City Council meetings. They'd be city manager informational meetings when I bring our city planner along and our economic developer and definitely invite the DDA and  but they're really just listening sessions. So people can tell us how bad we've been and how much we've ignored them. We need to clear that hurdle first before we can start moving forward. Because I do know that probably the last DDA director's feet on the east side were mine when I was fresh faced and walked up and down East Michigan Avenue to try to build that bridge way back then. And we need to keep doing it. So before we talk about multimodal plans and before we talk about TIF and corridor, we need to listen. And we need to listen for a while.  for a second. Because those things need to be brought up, but we need to listen to what those responses are. Because, hey guys, we have some ideas about what could work.

With that being said, however, I want us to consider moving forward hypothetically how we would answer somebody on North Street when we approved that unanimously.  why we approved that unanimously when we voted down William Street. And I want us to consider how we would answer that if we're being consistent, because we are talking about tens of thousands of dollars here. And we should be good stewards of that and understanding where people are coming from. And it is hard not to get emotional.

Um, one thing that I want to recommend is that we, um, I would, I would, it would be nice if we could have like the individuals who have comments,  on proposals that they have on the agenda, giving those individuals an opportunity to actually speak when that agenda item comes up. I know that might hold them present in the meeting a little longer, but I think someone who's coming into our community to build 76 houses or build 24 houses or whatever the project may be, should open a marijuana facility.  should have the grace of more than three minutes at the during public comment because they're here to do business with the city and I think that they should be allowed to speak during and this goes for staff when staff has items and issues that come up that we know are gonna require some discussion I think they should be allowed the opportunity to like start the discussion with presenting whatever it is that way we have  when we're doing deals with people and they're here and they're present, they have more than three minutes to discuss that item. And then we can also have a dialogue back with them to address any issues, like what Laura had today, had an issue with a specific builder that may have been able to be addressed through some dialogue to say, hey, I've heard this or I've had this experience or this has happened in the past. Can we talk about that so I can be comfortable moving forward?  or voting however I decide to vote on that particular issue.

JS_09_12_23,SPEAKER_05,"Good evening mayor, members of council, public, fellow staff. Thank you for making some time for me this evening. That's as good as it's going to get. I'll hunch over. Uh, so special assessment policy review. Um,  Give you a brief introduction of what we're in store for this evening. So I'd like to establish just some fundamental knowledge before we proceed with the changes to the policy. Then we will go through those changes individually. I'll give you some of my final thoughts on the matter and then we'll have a couple of nice quotes to ponder and some discussion.  although we could hold the discussion until the council agenda item should you so choose. So why do we specially assess? I think is a good question for those that may not understand. Obviously it provides funds for the roads and a special assessment I think it's important to understand is not a tax rather it is a  specific levy designed to recover the cost of improvement that confer a local and peculiar benefit upon property within a defined area. And so, that's cited from a court case, Cad's Band versus City of Granville. And I promise I will not read every slide. Fundamental knowledge here, a couple of things.  We're going to talk about benefit in a couple of more slides, and we're going to talk about what that means in regards to the courts. So the principle of contribution, I think if I were to provide you with an analogy, it might be or an example that might be that we would have a deck, and maybe it cost you $5,000 to build that deck to that home. That doesn't necessarily mean when that home sells that it's going to sell for $5,000 more.  it's going to sell for whatever that contributory value of that is in the market. So, the price that you pay is the cost. It is not necessarily the contributory value of that attribute. So, I think there's a very important distinction there that we need to make. And the second one would be the law of diminishing returns. And so, the more that something costs, it also doesn't mean that there is additional value added  One way that this was explained to me as a younger man was like insulation in a house, that you pay for that first layer of insulation and it provides you with a particular R-value. Should you double that cost and double that insulation, it does not provide you double that R-value. So the more that you give something doesn't always mean an equal return on that. So two, I think, key points to understand in regards to the benefit discussion we're going to be having.  And let's have that. So I'd like to cite a particular court case here. This is from the Supreme Court. In order for an improvement to be considered to have conferred a special benefit, it must cause an increase in the market value of the land. And so that also plays right into our very own city charter that proportion to the benefit  that all special assessments levied shall be based upon or be in proportion to the benefits derived or to be derived. So key to that discussion is the idea of benefit. Oftentimes, and I've got another slide here because this is so important, oftentimes we get confused when we talk about benefit in relation to special assessments. And it's very easy to look at the use of a property and say that a property benefits because they are getting  much more use out of it, and that is true, and that is a benefit. However, that's not the type of benefit that the courts are concerned with. So, when we talk about benefit with the court, we are only talking about an increase in value to the property. So, those two ideas are really separate from each other, and I think we need to be careful with that. So, I know it can be difficult to separate the two. I've had this conversation  Many times over the last maybe 18 months now that I've been trying to get this policy through. But I'll try to continue hammering home. And in fact, I've repeated on this slide, if anyone who's read through it, that very same case where in order for an improvement to confer that benefit, it's got to be an increase in market value to the property.  Uh, there's a couple of court cases here. Um, the leading case right now for special assessments is CAD ban versus city of Granville. Um, they cite Dixon road group and, and Dixon road group has a couple of key points that I think we need to keep in mind as we work through this information. Uh, it's going to find my notes here.  So it doesnít have to beówhen we talk about benefit, the courts arenít saying it has to be a rigid dollar-for-dollar benefit. And what they mean is, is that if weíve increased the value of a property, that it needs to be equal to the amount of special assessment. So it doesnít have to be rigid. Now, in this particular case, and although the Supreme Court upheld the special assessments, that assessment role was reverted back.  for reconsideration because they felt that those special assessments were in excess of 2.6 times the amount. So we've got an amount that we know is too much, but then they don't really give us an amount that they would say is proper. So it's really up to this council to kind of define what's a proper reasonable proportion to benefit.",356,738,"""""",Other,Other,0,0
JS_09_12_23,SPEAKER_05,"So, wrong way, sorry. On to the policy changes. Thanks, that's the only one I did. I didn't want to overdo it, so just the one. So, I've got about, I've got nine different things we're going to talk about here, but why I'm bringing this before you.  Certainly cumbersome. We try to be very considerate of the time that we spend. We realize our time is taxpayer dollars being spent.  My office spends an incredible amount of time. I studied this in my document. I believe what I've cited is about 48 hours per assessment roll of office time spent on this. Most of that time is spent on trying to make sure we get the front foot calculation correct. So the other issue here is that of those nine different parameters, you know, my office is certainly charged with having to try and explain that. And some of these are a little bit challenging to try and work through with our taxpayers.  And I think it's more complex than it needs to be to accomplish the same task. So I'm looking to streamline it. I want to make sure it's easy to explain and that it's easy to understand for all. I also want it to be better seated in the law. And I don't think there's anything wrong with our current policy, but I think it can be better. And that's what we're going to walk through today.  So let's cover street classification. I'm going to kind of go through these pretty quickly as be respectful of everybody's time. And there's not much to say on some of these, so we'll just breeze through them. So street classification, currently we've got this broken down into several different categories. This is based on traffic count from our engineering's office.  And so when we talk about traffic count, now we're back into what we would be considering a benefit of use. And as we've already covered, benefit is really the contributory value, um, in the increase in market value to the property. So, uh, this kind of heads back into that other direction where we're starting to consider use of a property. Again, um, my recommendation to you would be to remove that. Uh, next on the list here is the value of the property.  This is that 25% SEV cap. I'm recommending a no change on this. I think the SEV cap is an important attribute of our policy. Currently, the value of the property, like I said, is a critical component.  About 17.5% of residential housing stock based on that 25% SEV cap would see a full $15,000 special assessment. So the average home value based on 2023 was around $90,000 true cash.  That means the average home would pay a special assessment of around $11,250 based on the idea that it would be capped. That's not to say that they would pay that if the actual cost to construct was less than that. So I don't want anybody to misunderstand me when we talk about that SUV cap.  Integrated site, my recommendation would be to remove integrated site. What this, the idea of an integrated site is, is that in this example, the bar graph here is showing the house and a vacant lot. And if they both received a $1,000 assessment, the house would pay that full $1,000. The vacant lot can only be assessed  $200 because it would be SEV capped. What this policy does then is takes that value from that vacant lot that's been SEV capped and places it over to the house that is used as an integrated site. And so now that home would go up to an SEV cap. And I just came up with an imaginary value of $1,600 just to kind of illustrate that we would fill that up all the way to the SEV cap of the home.  The challenge here on this particular policy bullet point is the idea that each assessment must stand alone and independent of the surrounding properties. Next up would be irregular shaped lots.  If we talk about an irregular shaped lot, and this isn't a policy that gets used very much, but I will read this particular policy bully bullet point. The front footage assessment rate for parcels of irregular shape or size may be adjusted to place an equitable assessment that corresponds to the benefit realized from the infrastructure improvement.  And so, in this example, what we would end up with going through the calculation of effective front foot, which first establishes a standard depth and a depth factor. So this lot's a little bit deeper, and then it's also odd-shaped. We end up with a larger front footage than they actually own. Again, based on the language of the policy,  This isn't something that is implemented often, um, but certainly can be difficult to explain to a taxpayer who's paying on a larger frontage than they actually own, uh, corner lot reductions. Um, currently we give a 33% break to the longest side of the parcel. Um, and I think in a perfect world that this is just fine. Um, however,  we do not live in a perfect world. So if you consider a perfect square, um, we end up with some real challenges in my office about how to do that fairly. So, uh, the challenge becomes how do we administer this? And I think the largest challenge is when both roads are local. So we've taken kind of a hierarchical approach to this, that if you have a,  a major arterial and you have a local road, we will give that corner lot reduction to that local road cause it is going to have a larger percentage based on our street classification. Um, and then the, the challenge with that is we, obviously we have to go back through our records to figure out somebody on a corner lot who paid that last corner lot reduction and whether it's going to be justified for which street and if they've already received it. So, um,  My solution for this is let's just do simple division. If you live on a corner, we'll take that assessment and divide it by two. And that way we end kind of the research and we're going to assess that individual for  half of the frontage or half of the amount of assessment for that particular street, and then we would do the same on an adjacent street or a cross street, rather. Type of development. So this one would be replaced with a more clearly defined per unit method.  And so here's an example of the calculation, uh, currently that we are under, uh, for a 55 unit. We have what's called a residential equivalent unit. That residential equivalent unit is a calculation, uh, that the engineering's office helped us with, uh, based on, I believe water usage. Uh, we, we then reduce whatever that front foot rate currently is calculated at. And then we times it by the minimum lot with allowed by zoning.  And that's how we get a per-unit amount. We then take that amount times it by the number of units. I'm looking to simplify that process and have, based on a per-unit method, each unit would carry a half a share times that half a share times the number of units. So the calculated amount here you can see is much higher. However, I'm also proposing a ceiling on commercial property, again, based on the conversation of benefit that we had earlier.  and we'll visit that ceiling amount here at the end of this presentation, closer to the end of the presentation. So, size of assessment to calculate installments. Currently, we have a graduated system based on the largest assessment within that special assessment district. Assessments are big. My suggestion is that we just clean this up, move it over to a 10-year  I know that there have been some ideas about extending that. And I know that there are some concerns from finance. So I'd just speak on that really briefly to say that the special assessment operates in a deficit. And so when we extend that debt beyond that 10 years, we end up with less money in the special assessment fund in order to fund future projects. So that is why I think extending it beyond 10 years,  is not favorable. Now on the front foot and moving this over to a per-unit method, this would break everything down into a per share. So we would calculate based on residential properties equal one share, and we would add up if this was all residential properties and there were 20 properties within the special assessment district  there would be 20 shares. Uh, if it's in a 10 unit apartment complex, each of those units would be half a share. That's that 10 unit would be a total of five unit or five shares. Um, and then any commercial property that was not a condominium or apartment complex, we would give their land size consideration, uh, up to two acres. And then, uh, all commercial property is two units.  Above two acres, however, we would calculate it based on the land acreage, so five and a half acres would be 5.5 shares. That then would... we would take the amount to be specially assessed, divide it by the number of shares, and then spread that amount over the number of shares given over the residential commercial properties. So there's a couple of case studies here.  This is a local street example. Uh, this was, uh, recently before council. Uh, this is a 32 parcel special assessment role. Three residential assessments changed. Um, one increased by 7,300.  uh, one increased by almost 900 and another increased by about 200. The remaining 29 parcels were SCV kept. So obviously whether we per unit or front foot, those would really remain the same. Um, and, and this was really quick for me to throw together this per unit method. It took me about a half an hour to run through those calculations. So, uh, fair, fairly simple to explain, fairly straightforward to go through those motions.  I got a minor arterial example as a case study here. This is a small special assessment district, 12 parcels, 3 were residential. All but one assessment changed. So 3 residential properties increased by 13, 2 non-residential increased by 7,800, 1 non-residential  increased by 7,700. The remaining five non-residential parcels decreased. And again, that's due to that SEV cap where we're saying that the contributory value has a limit. So they decreased, as you can see before you.  The proposed policy change on the resulted was a net decrease of $24,600. So there would have been less money collected on the special assessment role, certainly very relevant and important when we talk about wanting to fix roads. Less money coming in means less ability to fix roads. So I don't want to overshadow that part of it. I just want to go back to that first example. That was an increase of about $8,000 on that first example.  So I, I think it's important to note at this point that this policy doesn't overall decrease or overall increase, um, you know, any type of threshold that we would be able to calculate. Um, it's just a different way of looking at these values, uh, up to this point. Um, and then the last bullet point here, value, uh, ceiling value ceilings, 15,000 residential,  It is already established, and I'd like to add a cap to commercial. And why a ceiling? Well, law of diminishing returns. And I left one off of here, of course, which is that principle of contribution. So some final thoughts. Look, there's no such thing as a perfect policy. You're not going to be able to please everybody.  And certainly, this is your folks' policy. I'm just the administrator here, but I want to bring to the table my thoughts on the issue. So certainly my desire, but this constantly bringing back this special assessment policy has made this very difficult for the folks who have to figure out how to pay for the projects coming up.  So this brings uncertainty to some of our city administrators. So that I'm asking that when you look at this, that you please be mindful of that, that we don't have any haste or delay, as this is certainly difficult for them to try to navigate as well. Policy provides me with the framework  And I just wanted to reiterate that all special assessments levied shall be based upon or be in proportion to the benefit. Again, I can't stress enough that idea of benefit and making sure that that fits into the right box that we, that the Supreme Court has told us that it needs to be fit into here.  If you're having issue with the size of the assessments that were before you, I know that the last council meeting we had nine assessments before us. Nine assessments did not get confirmed. Some of those were because people properly petitioned. Some of those were not. So if your issues with the size of the assessments, those controlling factors are really that SEV cap amount and the ceilings that we've talked about.  I got a quote here from a book I love called, Extreme Ownership. If you're not familiar, it's a great read. Author's Jocko Willink and Leif Babin. So, combat, like anything in life, has inherent layers of complexities. Simplifying as much as possible is crucial to success. When plans and orders are too complicated, people may not understand them. And when things go wrong, and they inevitably do go wrong,  complexities compound issues that can spiral out of control into total disaster. I've also mentioned on this slide that layers of complexity have served little purpose by which simpler processes could have accomplished the same. I truly believe that to be true. We are pulling a lot of levers in my office to render what the courts only need to understand is either reasonably proportionate to benefit or not.  And there is always an exception to the rule. So special assessments are a challenge. We're not going to draft a policy this evening that is going to fit every little thing. It's an island in Iceland, apparently, that's used for a hunting cabin now. A couple of quotes to ponder before I wrap it up here. Perfection is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.  Uh, Freddie told me that first name is pronounced Antoine D. Saint-Exbury. Thanks, Freddie. And, uh, and Maya Angelou, do the best you can until you know better. Then when you know better, do better. And I have lived my entire assessing career by that very quote. Thanks for listening.

I'm here for Tarion Walken, I mean, sorry, Walters, 19-year-old Tarion Walters, who was shot at Chalet Terrace. You know, when people think of civil rights, the path to equality for the black community comes to mind.  Some community leaders are working to create change and some are avoiding offending the Go Along, Get Along Gang. Speaking of gangs, the Gun Violence Prevention Program has not reached out to the Walters family. No one has knocked on their door or given them a call.  And I'm here this evening to speak up about the injustice that Terrion Walters is experiencing after he was shot in the neck by his neighbor. I think I'm very concerned, and I was honored to view the video footage  when Terry on was shot and I'm shocked that the shooter is not in jail. I don't know what's going on. Like I said, no one has reached out to Terry on family. They had a protest to protest thus far and no answers from City Council from the Jackson Police Department from the gun violence prevention program. Zero.  you know, communication. He's now paralyzed from the neck down, from the chest down. So I would like the Jackson Police Department to respond to the family and the community. Like I said, there have been two protests. Another one is planned. And the family and the community needs answers.  After dealing with the police department, going down to the police station, I believe that the unsolved shootings in Jackson are not the fault of the community. The officer said that they need more money. They need a raise. So I believe that families have been cooperating. They've been lied on. And I think, you know, our community needs help.  You all need to step up or step down. Arlene Robinson, we have no war meetings. Things are going on in our community that we don't know about. We still have questions. And we need answers.

This afternoon I was watching the CBS streaming news and they mentioned Joe Biden and the Republicans having  like maybe starting, you know, looking into a more official process of looking into Joe Biden, but they're suggesting that, you know, well maybe there's not a whole lot of evidence against him or anything like that, which is basically a lie, a media lie. Joe Biden has really been directing his son to get millions and millions, there's been over 20 million dollars that have been documented,  that the Biden family has received. Some people think it could be even upwards of 50 million dollars that the Biden family has received from foreign foreigners. So it's not just politics that the White House now will complain about.  But there is like the indictments on Donald Trump, you know, because some people don't like what he says, think he's a jerk and stuff like that.

JS_09_12_23,SPEAKER_16,"William Hastings, 1231 Highland. Concerning Mr. Yoakum's presentation, I have to say that I think the notion of an $11,200 cap on assessments is a non-starter, and I think it is a slap in the face to homeowners in Jackson. Divide that number in two, and maybe we can start having a discussion.  So on August 22nd, there was a massive fire on North Street at a 200,000 square foot abandoned factory site. Despite a flurry of local media coverage and several code red city alerts, all of the reporting from the city and media alike failed to mention a single extremely important fact about this local disaster.  Here's what the TV, print media, mayor, council, and other city officials fail to tell you. The factory site at 140 and 150 North Street is an EPA cleanup site. It is a site so contaminated with toxic waste that is a direct concern of the federal government and the Environmental Protection Agency.  The EPA recently spent 14 months assessing this site for cleanup, but the actual cleanup was never performed. So what was on that site? Asbestos, petroleum products, VOCs, which are volatile organic compounds, which includes many chemicals and industrial solvents, fuel oxygenates, and chloroform.  This was represented to the public as just a big fire in an old building, but not as a direct environmental hazard that may sicken and kill many people in Jackson for years to come. As the Brooklyn Exponent, which did actual detailed reporting noted, quote, officials say they can't yet say for sure whether those chemicals could create a long-term health hazard to homes surrounding the burned property.  They also report that 25 of the 23 debris samples collected, approximately a quarter tested positive for asbestos. There don't seem to be any efforts underway to survey residents of that part of town as to their personal exposure that day or to measure long term environmental impact. So at the most basic level, incumbents Daniel Mahoney, Will Forgrave,  and City Hall insider and member of the Environmental Commission, Connor Wood, that nowhere to be seen after one of the worst environmental events in city history. They all represent the indifference and arrogance of a city government that literally does not care if you live or die.  Vote the Clean Sweep ticket in November. Peter Bormuth in the second ward, Diane Tomin in the fourth, Steve Ann Sweeney in the sixth, and John Wilson for mayor. The health and lives of your families are on the line. Wake up, Jackson.

You know, I go, I'm coming down Lansing Avenue and it has a closed two miles ahead. I go down Ganson and I could look down Blackstone. It's not closed. So somebody didn't move the sign back so that we would know that.  I don't like to go down West Avenue. I don't like to go down Monroe. It's too bad. It's going to tear my car apart. I only go down Monroe when I have to because of our terrible roads. But I, I just starting out with that after a door knocking for two weeks, the a hundred homes project is a bust. I found two people that knew anything about it.  Um, I do agree with Laura, the homes at 900 905 on Blackstone, they're not a two story. They're one story. We need more of those types of homes in our area for handicapped people or people who cannot go upstairs. The other homes look just like the ones that you built in the eighties when you'll look at them.  And if you don't know where they're at, I can tell you later. Our roads are terrible. We can't think of anything else besides our water, which that situation is getting set with the lead lines. But we have to get these roads fixed. It's not just my street. My street's fine, but other streets. You can't have new houses  if you don't have good roads. We are known to cross the state of having the worst roads in the state even compared to Detroit, which I don't know. That's just what I was told. Another issue that I got to quickly go through is that homeowners are being fined for not trimming the trees in their right away. I don't know. That's what one person told me. That's all I can go by.  And she had a carport in the backyard for a canopy for a sun porch. She was fine for that. Another individual who has since moved had a boat on a trailer at the side of his garage. I've seen it multiple times. It looked fine. And another lady on Wisner told me that her son's car had one part of one tire on the back grass.  and it was not in the driveway and she was fined. She fought that and then got fined for $350 for court costs. We can't do that. We're all here to make our community better. Thank you.",2542,2726,"""""",Public Comment,Commenter,1,0

So I gathered up my old notes. I will tell you what I would like to see, if you have a concern with that type of discussion. The current, it's a 20, it works out to roughly be 25% of STDs. It's simple. You have your convoluted,  formula, but basically if you do the math, it's about 25% of SED with a $15,000 cap for a special assessment. So when we look at the houses on Burr Street or any of the ones that we most recently looked at, that makes their assessment roughly $8,000 to $10,000, which I personally, as a realtor with my experience, 40 years in the real estate field.  God, you're good, Freddie. Anyhow, with my experience as a realtor and appraiser and way back, I don't think that that value adds to the real estate. But if I do the math and I take that down to 12.5% of SCB, where the special assessments get down to a $4,000 roughly for that area,  but then you, you translate that over into a higher valued area. You're still going to get roughly, I think the same type of value. I do think we saw value on Franklin street, which was a really big project. Um, and it has a variety of value of homes on it. And that's where we put the $15,000 cap in after Jason's recommendation.

The, um,  Because, you know, the Franklin Street being the example, at the east end of that project, you had lots that were like 66-foot frontage, possibly some that were about 60-foot. At the west end, you have people that own half a block.  and they are owning more than 130 140 feet of frontage. If you have it each, you're saying that the person that is poorer is not as wealthy as the others, um, are paying the same amount of assessment as you know, the each is the person that has the big house with the swimming pool and the, you know, they own half of the block on, um,  on Franklin, but then they owned like 200 feet going down the side street. Those lots, you know, to say that they are the equal to, you know, everybody paying each does not make sense.  capping, um, the businesses, um, a few years ago we did, um, the work on Wisner. Um, if you go and you look at that, the amount of front footage that, um, Sears owns on Wisner street is almost like a quarter of a mile and they were assessed 86,000. Everyone was concerned that Sears was going to come and fight us and everything else.  They didn't say boo. They just paid their assessment and that project went, but they also own huge frontages. If you go on to the east side of the city, you've got consumers owns, um, the old power plant where Goodyear used to set. They own a whole block over there. The people on the other side of the street, you must have five or six houses there. You're going to cap consumers at, um, $30,000.  this past council meeting, um, when you approve North street, um, uh, it was a commercial on the North side. One of them was 46,000 that was on that assessment and that was approved by this council. So to say that, you know, we want to,  ratchet it down, it will bring in less money the more you lower that. And by front footage, you could, instead of spending a lot of time analyzing some of the lots that are by meets and bounds description, just round it to the nearest foot.  Don't try and sit there and figure out to what decimal is it. And that would save a lot of time in analyzing what the amount of frontage is that. And it's like one of my technicians years ago said, we're not building a Swiss watch here. We're just building a road. And so the length that you're calculating things out to do not need to be to multiple decimal places. Just round the assessments to the front one footer.  And if you're concerned, brown down.

Would it be an accurate assumption to say that this change will cause a general, a general decrease for streets that have a majority of commercial properties and a general increase for streets that are majority residential property? And I asked that question because all of the research that I've done really says that a per unit method of assessing properties  is best for a community that has a majority of multi-family homes or multi-unit buildings, whereas Jackson is majorly a single-family home.

Uh, so the scv cap on local roads where houses are given that the cost to construct is so large now, I would say that regardless of the method,  the SEV cap is what comes into play the majority of the time. So I can't answer that question exactly, but I would say in my view of assessments in general, we are SEV capped, so the method that we apply is irrelevant. For commercial properties, you're correct.

Um, the first component that we're asking you to consider tonight, well, the only component we're asking you to consider tonight is a 3.8% cost of living adjustment. Now to the mayor's point, the report was more in depth and very robust and it prescribed a different way of thinking for our pay bands and, uh, breaking our employees up into the different groups, um, based on, uh, their job descriptions, their technical skills, the amount of people that supervise factors like that.  And again, to the mayor's point, there are some positions that fall out of their recommended percentile. So in my opinion, and this is just my opinion, there is no reason to wait. I think that the city employees deserve this, and I think that it takes two readings plus 30 days anyway, so there's plenty of delay. But we will have GovHR to walk you through the rest of the report so they can go into those details that  that are in the report about banding the different groups we have together and things like that, where you can talk in depth about how we can matriculate certain positions to where they need to be.

JS_09_26_23,SPEAKER_08,"the compensation and benefit survey that we conducted, the proposed compensation plan, how you would implement it and then manage it going forward, and of course I'll answer any questions that you may have. So we were asked to conduct a classification and compensation  Study for the city. And so there's two parts to it. One is the job evaluation piece. And the other part is the compensation survey and the benefit survey. So to do the first part of it, we work with the staff. We had some preparation meetings.  We determined comparable communities to Jackson in order to survey for compensation and benefits. We had some employee meetings. We distributed material. We talked about the study, what it is, what it isn't. And then we asked the employees to fill out a questionnaire about the work that they perform. We then went through what we call a job analysis process. And I'll talk a little bit more about that. And we developed a classification plan  Which is essentially the list of all of the positions that were covered by this study in a new plan in different grades.  And then the second part was going out to the market. You know, we determined comparable communities. We put together a survey of positions and some benefits. We sent it out. We gather data. And so we gave a draft report. Now you have a final report. And I'm here tonight to just give you the overview again and answer any questions that you have. So when you do job evaluation, you want to look at positions in the city.  in relation to each other, because as you know, you can have an employee in a particular job or classification that if they went to a different community, even though they might have the same title, some of the duties might be different. So by asking employees what they do, by asking them to answer questions about these nine different job factors, we can then  look at all of the positions in Jackson in relation to one another and create a classification plan. So on this list here you know every position has some type of level of education needed, years of experience, they have to exercise judgment, you know some people supervise, there's always a technological component. So we ask each person to fill out a questionnaire and then we  interview people and we talk about their different positions. So what that allows us to do is to look at the jobs in relation to each other and develop a plan, which is called a classification plan. And what it creates is what we call internal equity, because we're comparing all of the positions in Jackson to one another and internal equity ends up equaling pay equity.  So that's the first part of the study and it's really important because we want to make sure that it's very unique to Jackson. So this methodology we can use for all positions in local government in different states, but we want to really understand the work in Jackson so we can create a plan that will work for you. So during the job evaluation process, we have the employees fill out a questionnaire,  And then we interview at least one person, which with each job title, so we can really understand how the work is performed. We then develop that classification plan. It's in your report as table one. So if you're looking at the, if you have a printed version of the report, it's on page twenty three. If you look at the PDF version, it's on page twenty six. So.  That establishes internal equity. It's what drives your study because it's unique to the city. Then in some cases, we could make some title change recommendations that might better reflect what someone is doing. That was the first part of the study. The second part was looking at the market and making sure that your pay is competitive and that your benefits are competitive. Because as you know,  especially in the past few years, you want to make sure you're attracting and retaining really great people, because the jobs are important, the service is important. So what we do is we go through an analysis to determine comparabilities. And you can see on this list here, most of the criteria that we use are financial. So we have the equalized assessed value, the per capita income, the total expenditures,  state sales tax indebtedness and property tax revenue. We also look at proximity and population because you wouldn't compare to a community that's in northern Michigan. You may recruit a department head, but probably not your regular frontline employees. So when we make a recommendation to you,  We want to look at communities that are similar from these criteria, because it really helps translate into ability to pay. So we just don't pick random communities. We actually go through an analysis. And in your report, there's a few appendices. The first one, Appendix A, was that questionnaire that I talked about that we gave to the employees. The second one is this analysis. So if you're interested in looking at exactly how we did that, it's in Appendix B.  But these are the communities that we determined to be comparable to Jackson. And you can see that there's a weight and there's a total score. And you had quite a few that scored over 80 points, which is really good. That means that they're very comparable. Sometimes when we do studies, maybe it might be in a different location, maybe more rural. We might have to go down to 70 or 60 points. So the fact that you have all of these communities scoring 80 points or higher is very positive.  So these are the communities from which we requested information about compensation and benefits.  When we do a study, there's just a few things I want to point out. First is we can't survey for every position. So we pick benchmark positions, ones we will find in other communities, and we define them. And the reason for that is because if you go to another community, some positions have the exact same title, but others don't. So we want to make sure we're getting the right data.  We look at the data, we make sure it is relevant data. If it's not, sometimes we might remove a few data points. So in the appendix, in the report appendix C that has all of the salary data, you can see if we disagreed with something, we highlighted it, we removed it, and we showed our work. So we look at it very carefully. And we really try to use what we're given  from other communities because they're reading the definitions and they're saying, yes, this is our comparable position. But once in a while, something pops up and we know it's not a comparable position and we may remove it. The other thing is we try to use salary range data in our analysis as opposed to an actual salary. And the reason for that is if you have a range, it's a better gauge of the market. If you only have an actual salary, then  You don't know the market conditions under which someone was hired, nor do you know their tenure. So range data is a better type of information to use in an analysis. And then when we do the study, we pick a snapshot in time. So if you're going to do a survey for salary and benefits, you say, OK, here's the time period that we're doing it, and we gather information. Sometimes a community may be a year behind,  Maybe they have a situation where they haven't awarded a general increase, but that is irrelevant when you do a survey, because if you had an employee in Jackson that decided to take a position in that community, that's the market at that time. That's the range for the position. So it is a snapshot in time. And then the last thing is we did gather some data for benefits. You can see we had some paid leave, longevity, and a few other benefits. So we looked at that as well.  What you have in your report too are some other tables. There is the narrative and then there's a few tables. Table 2 and Table 3, Table 2 is on page 25 of the report, Table 3 is on page 27 of the printed version, and then 28 and 30 of the PDF. But when we looked at the compensation, we calculated pay ranges at the 75th percentile. What that means is,  from the comparable communities, 25% of the communities pay more for the same position and 75% pay less. And the reason why that's important is at the 75th percentile, if your philosophy is there and you establish yourself as a payer there, you're above average. You become more of an employer of choice and you're in a better position to attract and retain  Better talent so so it's a really great place to be if you embrace that philosophy. So, so that's what you see on table 2, as far as the ranges and then table 3 is just the calculate calculation of the ranges with the gradation and the range spread, which I'll talk about in a moment. But we develop 13 ranges. Um, actually, there's, there's a separate band for the city manager, which is just data.  But in the classification plan, there's 13 different grades, and you can see here that three of them are assigned to what we would call administrative and technical positions, and then grades four through nine are supervisors and advanced technical, and then grades 10 through 13 are your directors and senior managers. So we put the positions in bands based on the type of job, and then we look at the data within each of those bands, and we calculate ranges, and we recommend the pay ranges.  So, gradation and range spread are the two things that we can use to look at the data and try and match the market. And by calculating in those bands that I just talked about, we have a better ability to do that. So, the gradation is the difference in starting pay between the grades. So, you can see here, grades one through three, the gradation is 5%. So, what that means is grade two starting pay is 5% higher than grade one,  grade 3 is 5% higher than grade 2. The gradation jumps to 7.5% for those middle grades, and then grades 10 through 13 have an 8.5% gradation. And then the range spread is the difference from minimum pay to maximum pay.  So, again, you can see it's a little bit different and the theory behind that is, if I'm, if I'm coming into the city in a position in grade 1 or 2, it's more of an entry level position and it's likely I'll start at the lower end of the range. But if I'm coming into the city in a position in grade 12, that means I'm at a director or senior management level.  And you may bring that person in a little higher into the range because they have some experience. So you want to have a broader range so people have the ability to have increased compensation over time. So you can see the ranges from 30%, 35% and 40% as you go up into the compensation plan. And then the information we collected for the city manager position, we did do that and we have a recommended range.  The position is not classified because it's a direct report to you, but we did look at data, so you have that as a guide going forward. On the benefits survey, we looked at benefits in relation to paid leave, longevity, and then a few others. Your wellness program, do other communities have that? Do they have a performance bonus system or volunteer benefit?  And what we find a lot of times is that they are comparable, your benefits are comparable. There are some variations, nothing that gave me any pause, but in the narrative of the report, we talk about those minor variations, and then Appendix D of the report has the data. So if anybody wants to look at what is the paid leave in all these other communities, you can see the actual detail.  And then going forward on the classification side, you know, I've worked with the staff. They understand how to classify jobs. You know, there's a manual that you have. You have that to maintain your system. HR can maintain the system with administration. And in the future, you know, if you're looking at that classification plan and making sure, you know, if a position needs to be added, changed, abolished,  If you do that, it will last you for a long time, 5, 10 years or more. The only reason why a plan would not be relevant is if you had explosive growth or if you didn't maintain it. If you're maintaining and if you're making sure that you're addressing any changes on an annual basis, it will last you for a very long time. Then on the compensation side,  You know, we went through a process to establish comparable communities. So when budget is being developed, all you really need to do is send an email to those communities and say, hey, you know, are you adjusting your ranges? Are you giving a general increase? And if you look at all of the responses, you take an average and you do the same thing in Jackson.  and you adjust those ranges, you will stay competitive with the market. So it's a quick exercise to do every year during budget to make sure that your pay is competitive. So that's my general overview of the study. I will stop sharing my screen and I'm happy to answer any questions that you have.",415,1277,"""""",Other,Other,0,0

This is a very in depth and phenomenal work, uh, that, that you've done. And thank you for the presentation. Um, I guess, can you just, uh, explain in some of the recommendations that you've made? Um, I don't directly see an answer to, to that in particular, like if we're on,  on, uh, if we are in a comparable position to other, um, communities, if there are any increase or decrease recommendations that we should consider, um, based on the, on the, uh, report that you've given us.",1619,1684,"""""",Other,Other,0,0
JS_09_26_23,SPEAKER_08,"So on table two, um, which is on page 25 of the printed version, 28 of the PDA, there is a column,  that as a current salary in relation to the proposed salary range. And you look at that, you'll see that the majority of employees have a current salary that's within the proposed range, which means that they're paid at market. Now, they may be a long-term employee that's at the bottom of the range, but at least they're in the range. You know, that means that their current salary is somewhere in that market value.  You do have some employees that their current salary is above the maximum. There's just a handful of those. And you have a few more employees where their current salary is below the minimum of the range that we're recommending. So to implement the study, the most basic thing to do is to make sure that  Anybody that's current salaries below the minimum for the range, they should come up at least to that minimum. Because what it's telling us is that their current salary is below market. Conversely, for the few employees, I think there's maybe five. If I'm looking, I'm looking at this pretty quickly. Six, seven, eight, nine. No, there's maybe nine that are above the maximum.  We don't know why that is. Sometimes the market value for the position changes. Sometimes the job is reclassified as a result of this saying, you know, the value we want to have in Jackson.  is here in our classification plan, but the market might say otherwise. So in those cases, if you have an employee whose current pay is above the maximum, you don't want to reduce it because they had nothing to do with that. The individual employee had nothing to do with that happening. So what will happen over time is if you keep the pay where it is, the range, you will adjust it. Like I talked about before, if you  If you survey other communities, you know, that say they're giving an increase of three percent, you know, that range is going to continue to move over time. And eventually that employee's pay will fall back in. And then you can you can give them some general increases. You know, there's more strategies, you know, that you can employ depending on exactly what you would want to implement it.

JS_09_26_23,SPEAKER_15,"Are these comments timed? No. Take your time. Thank you. So there are many, many issues and unanswered questions involving residents in actions involvement with a federal grant. We were told to help the homeless in Jackson. Number one.  Residents in Action won the bid to manage these federal funds despite one, submitting the highest bid over established local social service non-profits. And two, even more important, RIA is not, repeat not, an accredited non-profit and did not, repeat not, have 501c3 status.  Number two, Residence in Action has personal and professional ties to the mayor, Daniel Mahoney. Among other things, Mr. Mahoney co-founded and co-chaired another local non-profit called Racing for Equity, with one Keisha Hamilton, who is a prominent member of RIA, as well as holding an appointed position in the city of Jackson. Three.  RIA's grand plan to help the homeless involved booking them into a dingy motel that is an open-air drug market and then dumping them back on the streets when the money ran out. Why the city of Jackson need to hire a third party to do this at all is questionable. RIA also committed to feeding the temporary residents of the motel, but a whistleblower who stood before all of you, stood right here where I'm standing,  explained they were not being properly fed and sometimes only given uncooked hot dogs and lunch meats. Number four, despite having a large budget item in the grant, their bid, the RA bid for the federal grant money, a large budget item for food to feed the people involved in the program, the food service was low quality, and RA failed to get people signed up for SNAP benefits out of the gate. Isn't that funny? Isn't that weird?  Of course, it is far harder to skim off a few dozen separate SNAP cards than it is to skim off a large single budget item for food. At the urging of one incredulous Jackson City Council member, Ms. Tasha Carter finally agreed that enrolling homeless people she was supposedly helping for SNAP benefits they legally qualified for might actually be a good idea.  So getting food assistance via SNAP to help the people they were supposed to help was apparently less enticing, far less enticing than buying food with funds that were flowing directly through their own hands via the federal grant. Big red flag. Number five, whistleblowers who spoke out against the shoddy conditions and substandard food provided by RIA were harassed and menaced. Number six, when it came to provide actual receipts and proper accounting for the spending of the federal grant money, RIA dragged their feet for months.  And to this day, I do not believe their financial accounting has been subject to review by any true independent party or auditor. Given their direct connection to multiple members of Jackson's city government, this is a grave oversight.  And finally, as Jackson submits new grants for far larger amounts of federal grant money for homeless programs, Mary Mahoney, instead of recusing himself, continues to personally advocate for residents in action, still on it accredited and still tied to him to be eligible for the large sums of money. The city is asking for new homeless spending. So many red flags, so many still unanswered questions.",2461,2657,"""""",Public Hearing,Commenter,0,1

JS_09_26_23,SPEAKER_01,"Thank you, Mr. Mayor. John King, two zero three third street here in the city. Um, with some of your comments, just a few moments ago, uh, suggesting residents in action did a really good job or that, uh, some person in some agency said the, you know, let that person come here, you know, uh, they didn't do a good job. Um, and they had some of the things maybe I'll want to talk with, uh, that, uh, you know, maybe,  if this information gets to the feds, maybe they might do something. I doubt it. I seen in the report, it said no comments as of yet. You know, this was when I first read it a couple of days ago.  even though there were postings like on the different properties that the, like the Jackson house and commission properties and other things. I don't know why that was. It was a little weird, but, um, I think for the most part with this hearing, uh, I didn't really, I'm not even sure if Aaron Demick put something out on the Facebook page. So, um, as far as, uh,  the feds wanting comments about, you know, like this caper or whatever it's called. I thought that was a little odd, but, you know, it's when something's not well published or communicated that we really want to get a lot of comments. It's almost like you would prefer a known comment that maybe not everything  you expect to hear will be what you want to hear. I know like there was the homeless prevention that this mentions and like the money that went to RIA and some of the other efforts for the so-called homeless. I read an article it was on MLive regarding Ypsilanti and sort of like the homelessness there and all the  the major problems it's causing by the way the city is handling it. There were a couple of comments where two different individuals regarding regarding homelessness were like one was the root of the problem is housing. Then the next one in the article was there is a solution and it's housing and it's as simple as that. It's actually not a lot of the efforts that  were taken like in let's say with RIA or the homeless prevention. A lot the main issues is a lot of people have drug problems. There a lot of them are serious drug addicts. A lot of them have mental health issues. So it's not as simple as housing or just give  someone like Ria money and, you know, allow them to, you know, spend it, you know, put some of the so-called homeless up in hotels that that, uh, fixes the problem. It actually does. And, um, with some of the numbers, like with Ria, uh, part of the promoting them as doing a great job was like the apples to oranges comparisons. There were a couple of, uh, the RFPs,  that were submitted that were based on 30 days where with residents in action they did it for at least three days and so they're all along they were making apples to oranges comparisons that oh we're doing all this great work you know when it was only like 30 days worth um which was uh wrong the way they did it and it was apples to oranges comparison  uh, part of, uh, all the stuff that was wrong with that program and with the city going through them. Now they've gotten five Oh one C three status, but that still doesn't, uh, uh, make up for, you know, what went on last summer and in January and all that. Um, for the pellet shelters, I had just got back, uh, uh, uh, for, uh, um,  I had done a FOIA because I wanted to find out where Laura Schlecte had mentioned that the pellet shelters that you got the, Mr. Mayor, that you had kind of forced the entire council to, you know, buy, spend the $150,000 on it at the time. And then, you know, it's been a few months now at least Laura Schlecte had mentioned that rather than them being installed  and put up and everything they were put into storage in the Department of Public Works building. So I tried doing a FOIA to find out exactly why they couldn't be put up on by the T.A. Wilson School property. And so the first thing I got was you know that oh well to fulfill the request I would need to give the city a bunch of money to  for checking on some emails or texts and stuff like that. So I had shrunk it down to the DPW director's communications where I assume  he would have to be at least copied on a lot of these things that, uh, as far as why the pellet shelters can't be put up at T Wilson school and, uh, and why it's in, you know, a building he's in charge of and stuff like that. Well, today I got that. Oh, there, there's no communications responsive to my FOIA. Um, which is like, why wouldn't he be?  at least copied on all these communications about what's going down with the pallet shelters. But in essence what I know from experience with FOIA is that you know the city is trying to not put forward exactly what went down with the pallet shelters. We know that you  were saying, oh, it's 34 degrees right now. People are going to die. And you even got in the city manager's case that, oh, why didn't you look in the, that was, I think, maybe early December. You're upset with the city manager that he didn't look and almost essentially get the quotes and stuff for the pellet shelter. So he continued on.  uh made sure those the the 150 grand was spent on pallet shelters and then now that it turns out that you know they they can't I guess allegedly from what uh Laura Schlecty was saying that if they can't be put up or something seems something's wrong and I use FOIAs to try to find out and I get this you know nope  you you can't find out so something's wrong there and um as far as the pellet pellet shelters and you know you know like i was saying at the time you shouldn't have gotten it and i thought you were just going to urinate 150 grand away and that's what i suspect right now is that  you know, it's money that was urinated away. And so I would like the facts to kind of know that, uh, that, you know, I have trust issues with way things have been going with these, uh, federal funds. And one, one thing that stuck out, um, in the, uh, in the agenda, you know, it sort of mentions racial and ethnic composition of families assisted.  It separates it in a CDBG and then a home. So over for the CDBG, it's got like a white five, black or African American three, everything else is zero. But then over at the home, it's got white zero, black or African American 14, Asian zero,  American Indian or American Native, zero. Native American or other Pacific Islander, zero. Nothing for blue people, nothing for green people. So all 14, it says, went to black or African-American. So you've talked about in the media,  uh, they push that, you know, if there's so, uh, over representation of black people that that systemic racism and maybe bad. So, but with these numbers, I mean, you know, 100% going towards black or African American, uh, you know, I just wonder what's going on there. You know, that seems like one heck of a over representation. So,  Um, so those are a lot of my concerns about, uh, that I would like to maybe pass on to the feds.

I just forgot to change it before you got this version, so we caught that after the fact. That should just be unhighlighted. So I wish that HUD designed the chart that you see here on page 2. I wish that they put a bit of a break there, so you're actually looking at two sets of data. If you look over in column 1, 2, 3, 6, starting in 6,  6, 7, and 8 should really be one batch of data, and that's on the five-year plan as a whole. Our CDBG and our home plan operates on a five-year rotation. This is year three. This is representative of year three. So the five-year running total is the first three columns there, and then the far three columns on the right, starting with expected program year, actual program year.  That's just indicative of the 22-23 program year. So I wish that we had a little bit of a break there. I think it would be more visually representative of where we are. So if you look at, say, CDBG new construction expected strategic plan, that's five new homes constructed in the entirety of the five-year plan.  But then when you see actual strategic plan, that's like a running number that adds all the years up so far that we've achieved in the plan, hence the three there. And then if you see the percent complete, the first one, that's percent complete of the entire five-year plan. Then the one on the right is the percent complete just of the year we're in. So like that 300% is a really big number, but that's because of the three that have been achieved so far in the five-year plan. All three just happen to be achieved in this year, hence the 300%.

Home ARP were additional funds that were allocated in 2021. The plan came before this council in the spring of 2023, I believe in March of this year.  So these are separate funds outside of our entitlement funds that come from both CDBG and HOME. And so that plan that was approved by this body talked about new construction and rehabilitation of existing homes as a good target. HOME ARP funds were generally designed for homelessness prevention. In other words, making sure that families either who are on the brink of homelessness or were kind of in that really horrible gap there were protected and taken care of. So general CDBG and HOME expenditures  while certainly target that area, the home ARC funds are really, really specific in their goal to address that issue. And so the purpose of the plan that we put before you that was approved was really to kind of target that unique spot, both with construction and rehabilitation.

JS_09_26_23,SPEAKER_05,"My name is Leah White and I live at 1934 Southwest Avenue and I am here to speak about the city of Jackson's trespass ordinance. I've lived at my address for 21 years and I have a neighbor who has been trespassing on my property and damaging it for the last three years. She had a survey completed so she knows the property lines. She spray painted my property in July, damaging it, vandalizing it. She had to trespass on my property to do it.  She placed a trip wire across my driveway, impeding my pathway, so I could not even enter my driveway. She placed a skewer on one side by the fence line and put a string with a skewer on the other side, which she had to trespass on my property to do it. The same day, she took her sprinkler, placed it on her property, but it went all over my driveway from 4 o'clock in the afternoon to 8 o'clock the next morning, keeping me from using my property.  Her water is a trespass on my property. I have four police reports indicating all of this. I filed a PPO. The judge denied it saying that there was no criminal intent, but it was a matter of trespass. He instructed her to stay off of my property. Four days later, she's continuing to trespass on my property and I have her on audio saying,  What are they going to do? She can't file a PPO. She has called me the N word among other things when I have approached her about it. She has a criminal record for assaulting a public officer. So she's not somebody that I want to continue to approach. And I feel like the city needs to, um, enforce their trespass ordinance. Now the city is charging her for malicious destruction of my property and I'm happy about it. However, I don't feel like I'm being properly informed.  I emailed yesterday to see if I should attend the arraignment, which is scheduled for October 2nd, and they told me that that was waived and there's a pretrial for Thursday. I had no idea. This is about me. I'm supposed to be the victim. The city prosecutor's office and the community development office have both told me that I need to contact the police if she's trespassing on my property.  But what I find interesting is right above your MDLP destruction ordinance is a trespass ordinance. So you're going to enforce one, but you're not going to enforce the other. She had to trespass on my property to damage it. And she continues to do so. Even this Sunday. And she has no consequences, so she's comfortable doing it. She's throwing birdseed all along my property to attract the animals and their feces, which is her intent. No consequence.  However, she made a complaint against me with the city because I did not have a fence permit, which I thought my contractor got. Um, so I get a code officer at my house for a fence permit for $75, but I paid $500 for variance. I'm not trying to skirt $75, but she's caused thousands of dollars worth of damage and the city can come out for $75. Thank you.",3961,4158,"""""",Public Comment,Commenter,1,0

So for a little perspective, uh, we can, should all take a look at what's going on just a short drive down. I 94 in Ypsilanti. Here's a few news headlines. Uh, December 7th, 2022 headline, uh, Ypsilanti church to open first winter overnight shelter in modern city history. Uh, February 2nd, 2023 headline long awaited Ypsilanti homeless shelter set to open Monday.  So Ypsilanti just opened a new homeless shelter with a staff of 10 people just eight months ago, and by golly, that's exactly what you're trying to do right now at T.A. Wilson. So wouldn't it make sense, since they're doing the same thing just a little bit ahead of you, to take a look and see how that's working out? MLive.  M-Live headline September 9th, 2023. Ypsilanti officials beg patience as tensions rise over downtown safety. Oh, that doesn't sound very good. Ypsilanti police and other officials are asking for grace and patience from the community as they work to address a housing crisis some say has led to an unsafe downtown area. Residents and business owners spoke at a nearly two-hour public comment session. That's mad. That's some angry people when you you speak you've two hours of public comment.  During Ypsilanti City Council meeting on Tuesday, September 5th, saying aggressive panhandling, ongoing partying, and public defecation has made living and working downtown difficult. Jen Eastridge, owner of two businesses on Michigan Avenue and Ypsilanti, said during the meeting she has picked up alleys littered with needles, condoms, and liquor bottles, and that panhandling and public urination has driven away business. So that's reality.  Reality is real. You as a body, as a group, by your actions, you are summoning up, you are invoking crime, chaos, and filth into a working class, working poor neighborhood in Ward 5 that's just a 5 to 10 minute stroll from downtown. The city's actions will trash this neighborhood without the consent of the residents and also degrade the revitalized downtown area in the city as a whole.  Anyone who sits on this council and supports turning Che Wilson into what will ultimately just be a flophouse for drug addicts, vagrants, and the mentally ill who pose a criminal threat to the residents of the city is sowing the wind and will reap a whirlwind of furious pushback when the ugly truth on the ground, the everyday reality on the ground for people in the Fifth Ward becomes manifest.  and becomes real. So I would just say you better be very careful of what you wish for. And for people to talk about equity, you're going to be wreaking destruction on the Fifth Ward and especially on the Morale Greenwood neighborhood. Those people don't know what's about to hit them.

JS_09_26_23,SPEAKER_01,"Thanks again, Mr. Mayor. John King, 203 Third Street here in the city. Our nation is facing perhaps his greatest threat now. In the last few days, President Joe Biden has named Vice President Kamala Harris the new gun violence czar. After Harris was named the border czar near the beginning of the Biden administration, the legal alien crossings hit record levels. Things have gotten so bad, the mainstream media is even reporting the truth about it now.  calling what is a border crisis being used despite the White House claiming they fixed the problem. It seems like many of the headlines for interviews  being reported in the last month or so, such as the Pennsylvania prison escapee, the child killed in a first day of school bus accident in Ohio, or a fentanyl death of a child in a New York daycare center, can all be attributed to illegal aliens and Vice President Harris handling of the border as borders are. Let's hope and pray she doesn't do for gun violence what she did for the border crisis.  Locally our ward our woke six war council members campaigning on the lie that the large increases in water rates is due to the lead service lines needing to be replaced as if to suggest he had no control over the matter and claiming the increases really aren't that big anyhow. The city of Jackson is receiving funds for the lead service line replacements. The fact is the water rate increases are largely due to the consumers  due to Consumers Energy being able to get out of the contract at the old Karen Morgan plant and pipe in their own water to their plant. Baker Tilley's reports last years have mentioned this several times. That was something our woke Sixth Ward Council member had control over and result in water bills in the city going up by the hundreds of dollars per year.  Our war woke six word member even had the nerve to state his opponent, Steve and Sweeney was being dishonest on the topic. Finally, as a sent off to my accounts, city council member Karen, but now I have to say the most disappointing thing about her on the council was her not wanting to hear from constituents. I read someone mentioned in the last few months that her email didn't receive a return from Karen.  I think there may have been a perception Karen was just mailing it in, so to speak. It was Karen who led the effort in the reading of citizen comments and forced people to have to come into City Hall and risk their lives during the pandemic in order to be heard.  The city council will point someone to fill Karen's seat until it is filled by election sometime in November of 2024, which will be followed up by an election in November of 2025. I push for changes. They had council vacancies being filled immediately as soon as possible, but to no avail. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Thank you, Mr. King.",4681,4871,"""""",Public Comment,Commenter,1,0

And again, I've asked several times, if you can show me something different, then I would be all ears. But every example that was shown shows an increase. The other items, as far as how it's split,  based on the categories of street, the cap on the assessments. Um, for, and again, for me personally, I'm not interested in, and this is just me, I'm not speaking for council. I'm speaking for me personally. Um, the, the cap when it comes to, um, a cap for commercial, um, I think it's something that's, that's, I'm probably going to be opposed to as well. Um, that's just me personally, but I think those would probably be the major three items.  that would be discussed because I think that it was a pretty, pretty largely based on the fact that the per unit versus front footage is the reason why the entire change was kind of shot down.

I don't know if there's a number of bathrooms per bedroom you have to have. I don't know the answer to that. But let's assume you can have one bathroom. I would pay $299 for that inspection.

I might have brought the wrong one. Hold on. Oh, here it is.  five to 50, I'm going to pay $230 times five. So it's a thousand something plus a hundred bucks as opposed to two 99 do to me. It's just a huge inequity. The landlord of a rooming house has to collect from each one of those people as opposed to one person.  they'd have to evict each one separately. So I don't know that, we shouldn't be judging the fee based on whether or not the landlord's making a profit or not. We should be basing it on reality. And reality is, it's a bedroom.  And my bedroom has got nothing special in it compared to anybody else's bedroom. You know, I just think it's an absorbent amount and I don't know what the answer is.

I would like my comments to be reflected in the minutes. I would like this request to be reflected in the minutes. I don't see anything wrong with that.

The only thing that's in the minutes are the motions that are made. So I definitely agree that if it's requested by a person speaking at that time, that if their request is made, I would like the following to be reflected, or I would like my comment to be reflected in the minutes that their request be honored. I think that's a reasonable request.  And sometimes it gets a little dicey because I had a whole dissertation across the street, um, that I requested to be reflected in the minutes. And it was so long that they called me like, can we paraphrase? And I was like, no, put every word that I said in the minutes, please.

You were, I think the first council person that I sat down and talked to after being elected. Um, I made it a point to sit down with every person on council, uh, so that I could get an understanding of what their concerns are. Um, these, I feel like you are the representation of what your ward wants, um, which is why you got elected. Um, so just a reminder of those issues that we talked about, cause I keep notes,  on pretty much every conversation and meeting that I have with people. So we talked about crime reduction and crime prevention, and I think that we've done a pretty good job at working towards reducing crime in the community. I mean, statistically, year over year in the last two years, we've seen crime be reduced in the last two years. Domestic violence issues, which I know we haven't quite started touching on that, but that's all enveloped  and that violence in the community issue, and I think that we definitely have to start paying more attention to how domestic violence plays a part in violence in the community as well. That's a super important thing. Drug prevention, and your statement that a majority of the cause to the fire department is for overdoses. We talked about poverty. That's an issue that I feel like we are maybe indirectly, but still trying to address, right?  infrastructure, lighting in the community, a community cleanup. We've done a couple of those, um, outreach to lower income population, um, to, to get and give information out, um, in a transparent way. I think that we've done a fantastic job at that. Um, homelessness issues, which we are addressing head on, um, and doing at least what we can do from the seats that we sit in. Um,  We didn't quite get to that project green light. Um, we haven't gotten a grocery store yet. Um, and we don't have a gas station yet. Uh, so I just want you to know that, um, your absence doesn't mean that these issues will go away. Um, because we know that these are issues that you brought to the table because of your affiliation and relationships inside the ward. So I, again, I just want to say thank you for being such a good council person  Um, and being such a good representative for ward five, um, in your three ish years of serving. Um, so thank you. Um, would be my comments again and good luck. Um, I will definitely make sure that I send a very stern text to my friend in Lansing, um, to say, please get her involved quickly.  But take good care of you as well. So good luck, and I'm sure we will see you again soon. Back to my couple of questions about the pallet shelters. Really just need some information on where they'll be placed and when they'll be placed, because they do fit inside of the puzzle of us trying to figure out what can we do as city council. And that was really the main conversation and the fact  people who are homeless have so many different nuances to why they're homeless and what they're comfortable doing. Um, I do think that apart, and I just want to state this because I do feel like this is just an issue when it comes to homelessness in general. Um, a part of the issue, um, that they're not quickly adopted. I mean, uh, the city manager and I just earlier today was, uh, texted an, uh, an article from, I can't remember what community it was from. Um, but about like some tiny homes that look very similar.  to these pallet shelters. But I think a part of the problem is NIMBY. You guys know what that is? Not in my backyard. I don't want them downtown, because I got a business there. I don't want them in my community, because I live there. I don't want them near my business, because I do business there. But I want them to go somewhere else. People are completely fine with homeless people being sheltered in alleyways,  behind buildings where they're tucked away and they can't be seen, um, under some bridge somewhere that they can just drive by and act like they're not there. But for them to be camped, it all of a sudden becomes a huge issue where we are trying to destroy an entire ward because they have no idea what's coming to them. Um, and I think that that is the problem. Um, and that's a portion of the problem that we're facing with us trying to take action to do something about homelessness in our community in the first place.  Um, that's just how I feel about it. Um, that would pretty much sum up my comments. Um, aside from the fact that I'm really excited about all of the fall, um, activities that the community will be able to enjoy all of the festivals, um, that we see happening in the fall. And I just want to put a challenge out for us to keep the momentum going into the winter time for somebody to put a winter fest together. I'm speaking it into the atmosphere.  And I know that the proper people who are supposed to hear it are hearing it. Congratulations to Beats in the Park. I don't know if they're watching the meeting, but they had a phenomenal event. It was a very, very dope event, something great for our young people to get out and get involved with. And I can see that being a growing staple in the downtown area.
