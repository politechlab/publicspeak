LS_08_14_23,SPEAKER_00,"All right, and we're here to discuss and present on Unity Apartments and the OPRA request for the property located at 230 South Holmes Street, Lansing, Michigan. First I want to begin with an overview of what is in OPRA. Then I'm going to dive into an overview of the project, then explain some details of the request for your consideration, and then ultimately talk about the impacts to the city of Lansing taxes as a result of this development.  So what is an OPRA? An OPRA relates to Public Act 146 of the year 2000, and it's named the Obsolete Property Rehabilitation Act, or OPRA for short. This provides a tax incentive that encourages the development of contaminated, blighted, or functionally obsolete buildings.  It involves two steps. First, the establishment of an obsolete property redevelopment district, and then second, the approval of an obsolete property redevelopment exemption certificate. These items can be done simultaneously, which is what we're doing here today.  So step one, the district. The governing body of a qualified local unit of government may establish an obsolete property rehabilitation district on its own initiative or upon a written request by at least 50% of the owners of the property within the proposed district, which Ms. Forsberg has requested. The next written notice of a public hearing is provided by certified mail to all the owners of real property within the proposed district. The next step is for the governing body to hold a public hearing, which you are here for today.  After this, the governing body adopts a resolution establishing the district and the determination that it meets the requirements under legislation. A district may include one or more parcels and a district allows for property owners to apply for a certificate. The district itself does not provide any tax benefit.  And then step two, the certificate. An owner of an obsolete property within a district will file an application for an obsolete property redevelopment exemption certificate with the clerk of the local government unit. That includes the details of the project. Again, Ms. Forsberg has filed this with the city clerk. Next, the governing body will hold a public hearing, and after which, the local unit of government shall, by resolution, approve or deny the application for the certification for up to 12 years.  Once approved locally, the application and resolution are sent to the State Tax Commission, or STC, and they have 60 days to approve or deny the request. And ultimately, the STC is responsible for the final decision and issuance of all certificates.  The tax incentive, if this certificate is issued, freezes the taxable value of the building at the current value for all local property taxes for up to 12 years. School operating and state education taxes are not abated as part of this OPRA.  Some of the benefits of an OPRA is that it encourages the development of blighted and obsolete commercial properties into vibrant commercial, residential, or mixed-use projects. And over the long run, an OPRA increases tax revenue and reduces threats to public health through environmental contamination remediation, attracts people to the city of Lansing, increases adjacent property values, and ultimately creates jobs as well.  So the project for your consideration is located at 230 South Holmes Street, Lansing, and on the map here, as you can see, it is halfway between East Michigan Avenue and East Kalamazoo Street, just south of Sparrow Hospital. More specifically, it's on the corner of South Holmes Street and Prospect Street. The property used to be the Unity Spiritual Church until 2019, where a fire occurred in the building, and the property was purchased in 2021.  The proposed development is a six-unit apartment building consisting of two studio units and four one-bedroom units. And one of these six units will be ADA compliant, featuring a wheelchair accessible ramp. Additionally, the apartments will have rental rates up to 80% of area median income. And the proposed development will be an interior build out of the property, maintaining the structure and character of the building. Additionally, the owner has signed the universal development agreement.  And here we can see a rendering of the proposed development. As you know, again, maintaining the character and structure of the building and each unit having its own separate entrance.  So this property has received a statement of obsolescence and it has been determined to be functionally obsolete. As a result of the fire, the interior of the building has been gutted, leaving just a shell of the former building. And on April 13th, 2023, the city assessor conducted a walkthrough of the property and determined the building to be functionally obsolete due to the former use and design of the structure, as well as the absence of heating, adequate plumbing, electricals,  and weaken brick walls as a result of the fire.  So the request for your consideration, the owner has requested a certificate for the length of five years to support the development of this functionally obsolete property. The total taxes abated over the five year life of the certificate is estimated to approximately $54,000. Of this $54,000, $20,000 is approximate City of Lansing's portion of that abatement, and the remaining $34,000 is the other local taxing jurisdiction's portion of that abatement.  and the impact to the City of Lansing taxes. So currently the property is generating $2,000 in property taxes for the city and $0 in income taxes. Now income taxes are projected to increase to $3,000 once the property has been developed in year one. This was calculated by taking the six units, each with an estimated income of $50,000, so $300,000 total, multiplied by the 1% City of Lansing income taxes, so $3,000.  And this is a 150% increase the total taxes from the $2,000 that the property is generating currently. The property will generate these income taxes over the next five years of the abatement as well as beyond the abatement once it expires in year six and beyond.  With regards to property taxes, again, currently the property is generating $2,000, and with the OPRA, the property is projected to still pay the $2,000 over the life of that incentive through years one through five, and then afterwards in year six and beyond, there'll be an increase to property taxes in the year after expiration to $6,300, and that is a $4,300 increase, or an increase of 215% of the current property taxes.  Overall, the project is projected to increase total taxes to the City of Lansing from $2,000 to $9,300, a 365% increase to the City of Lansing. I'm going to pass it off to Ms. Forsberg. Thank you, Simon. Hello, my name is Farron Forsberg.",400,847,"""""",Other,Other,0,0

I've lived in Greater Lansing area my entire life, and I'm working towards being a part of creating quality housing in Lansing. The proposed Unity Apartments Project is a redevelopment. The building was previously the Unity Spiritual Church, which was damaged by a fire in 2019, as Simon had mentioned.  I purchased the property in 2021, and since then I've been working on repurposing the building into six residential rental units. Each tenant will have their own private entrance into the unit, as well as a private storage space that will be located in the basement of the building.  When the building sat vacant for two years, I saw an opportunity to transform this obsolete building into housing.

Mr. Schrader was also with us in Committee of the Whole, talked to us a little bit about his background. He's lived in Lansing since 1998. He currently resides in the fourth ward.

I talked a little bit about how he actually started his own business back in 1991, where they focused on emergency environmental cleanup, things of that nature.  And over the course of some, I think it was 24 years, he actually was able to hire on 18 different people as part of that particular company. His first choice for appointment was the Lansing Board of Water and Light Board of Commissioners. I want to clarify, he talked about this being an exciting time for the board. And when I heard him say that, I believe he said that it was an exciting time for the board because there's so much discussion and effort around renewable energy at this time.  With that being said, he was asked whether or not he would ever consider sale of our public utility to a private company, and although he said never say never, he said he's certainly not supportive of that now, and actually referenced the utility as a major economic development tool, and specifically he referenced the fact that we were, or I should say that it was a  a major reason why we were able to secure our electric vehicle battery plant.

We always, I should say, historically have recessed in July, and then we had some venue issues in August. So we wanted to make sure that you were marking your calendars for the next constituent contact meeting for the third war that's going to take place on September 9th at 10 a.m.  And although I'm asking you to mark your calendars, I don't yet know the location. There's a possibility that we are actually going to team up with Councilman Garza in the second ward and kind of have a South Lansing constituent contact meeting where there is no featured speaker, but we just listen to you, your concerns, give you some updates that are critical with regard to South Lansing. Should that happen, we will meet at the Plumbers and Pipefitters Hall. If that does not come to fruition, then we'll meet at our usual meeting location at Alfreda Schmidt Southside Community Center at 5825 Wise, sorry, Wise Road.  But I'll make sure to update folks in the near future on that. And the other thing is I want to take the opportunity I have in going to different neighborhood meetings and taking calls from citizens across South Lansing, obviously we have a number of infrastructure concerns. And there are a few that seem to rise to the top in terms of volume of calls and concerns at meetings and things like that. So I did reach out to public services. I wanted to thank Mark Lawrence, as well as Andy Kilpatrick,  who provided a couple updates. The first is for Connors Avenue in the Churchill Downs neighborhood. They have long awaited construction, reconstruction of that road that is actually scheduled now to begin on August 28th. So that's great news. Also Hillcrest from Wadsworth to Wainwright.  is scheduled for road construction, or I should say a road treatment. That's also beginning on August 28th. We have had a lot of questions regarding Pleasant Grove Road from Holmes to Mount Hope. It is in horrid condition. What we're doing right now is we're actually engaging in what's called scoping work. So we are studying the road. We're studying the subconstruct.  And at some point we're trying to make recommendations as to, or I should say a determination as to what the best treatment for that stretch of road is. But it really is in kind of the infant stages. So more to come on that. And then the last piece is we have gotten a lot of complaints about the sidewalk conditions over on Truxton Lane.  So there are a number of trees in the right away that have created quite a bit, I should say, substantial upheaval. People have tripped and gotten hurt and things of that nature. It is on, I should say, we did alert our staff, it's on the to-do list, and it is actually scheduled to be fixed and completed within the next two to three weeks.

It was interesting with all of the new changes that have occurred in election law and our constitutional rights of those who voted, 85% of the people  People who turned out actually voted by mail-in ballot or drop-in advance of Election Day.

That means we'll have those folks taking open spots on LPD as we have folks retire and to make sure that we're fully staffed by the end of the year. I want to thank our  Lieutenant Governor Garland Gilchrist for his joining us at our second to last concert in the park over at Francis Park last Wednesday. I also want to thank Representative Emily Dievendorf who also joined us. It was great to see them both there and I know the folks really appreciated our Lieutenant Governor for being there, especially when the Governor could probably hear the music.  It was great to see him there. I wanna thank everybody that helped with the Mayor's Senior Fair. We had a tremendous turnout. I know Councilman Brown was there and we appreciate it. I know others wanted to be there but couldn't. But just, we probably had five or 600 people there. People were really excited to see each other, to talk, to share issues. So thank you to all the seniors and thank you to all the staff that planned it. Parks Department, my office, a variety of department directors.  Very, very successful. Thank you to the school district for allowing us to use Gardner as we do every year. Tremendous. Finally, I would like to address the situation that happened last week with the Lansing Police Department. As has been reported, we had a rash of stolen vehicles recently. A citizen called in a car theft and our police were dispatched. Officers arrived and made contact with a suspect and he fled from officers.  Those officers called for backup with a description of the accused's clothing. A short time later, an officer nearby located a young man wearing identical clothing and detained him. When other officers arrived within minutes, they confirmed it wasn't the suspect and he was immediately released. This is truly a case of mistaken identity during an active police investigation that was resolved, but I really don't want to downplay any trauma  that comes along with being detained by police officers. That is, it's something that can really influence an individual, a young person, and so we don't want to downplay that. I again join with Chief Sosby in offering my apologies to the young man mistakenly identified, as well as to his family. Our police department has provided our social worker  and a variety of other services to assist with any trauma that he is facing. They are doing everything they can to show him that it was truly a mistake and to, again, assist with trauma. We know that our police department strives for protection, for perfection in protecting our citizens and in solving crimes. And in this case, they made a mistake and they own it.  So again, I wanna offer my apologies to the young man who was temporarily detained, as well as his family, and we'll continue to do what we can to alleviate any trauma as a result.

I was there the first day the city attorney came in and explained to HRCS what their charge was. I was surprised that I didn't know what that was because it could have fielded a lot of the complaints that I get daily and don't know where to take them outside of the administration. And then when we all sat there and realized what the charge was, the very next meeting a month later, maybe it was two months later, they came in and tried to switch the whole charge and told them none of that they were responsible for anymore. And some of the things, as Brian T. Jackson asked, discrimination,  investigating discrimination claims, all these different things. And they're just snatched off of there because they said they don't have an administrative role. Well, there is nobody outside of the city attorney's office to take complaints if you're a citizen. This ain't the time for that.  I want to speak on just real quickly why we say that. The city of Lansing, first of all, obviously has been sued multiple times for race discrimination. So why they're attacking this outside board that would absolutely be able to look at this as citizens is obvious why they want to attack that and take that ability away. And now they're talking about directing all of that to the HRCS department and under somebody who works for the administration and the mayor.  The apology on the situation that happened in Waverly Park, if it was the police department's first time doing something like this, I could understand the apology. And we say, oh, you know what? They made a mistake. But that's not true. Over the last five years, they've killed six people, one unarmed inside the jail. Six people have died at the hands of LPD.  How many complaints I receive on a daily about VCI just running over people, stopped at a light, unmarked cars, ravishing, jumping out with firearms. There is going to be an incident involving our police department and our young people in this city, because for whatever reason, the Lansing Police Department believes that everybody that's black or brown is a predator out here. So why would it seem that they come up on a 12-year-old and a parent standing there saying, no, that's my son, and they still have this attitude and this energy?  because even the parent was a predator as far as they was concerned. So it's really unfortunate that the whole world is watching. I'm sitting here, as I'm sitting here, I'm looking at Michael Strahan speaking on ABC this morning about this incident here, and not one person from the council spoke on it. Not one person brought this up. The whole world is watching this. The whole world is watching us. And fortunately for you, Mayor, nobody knows of all the things that have took place with the Lansing Police Department.  Nobody knows the multitude of things. Nobody knows that the Lansing Police Department is under mandate right now from the Department of Justice. Nobody knows any of this. Nobody knows that the city of Lansing is being sued multiple times and actually owes a million dollars for race discrimination and hostile work environment. Nobody knows all this when they're talking about it. And the only thing we had outside of the mayor's administration to bring this conversation to was the HRCS department and now that's wiped.

But in contrast, the way that we have been operating in this city when it comes to issues like this, it is the exact time. And the timing couldn't be even better to suppress the truth, which is what's been happening for the last six years when it comes to issues like this. So the whole stripping away of the HRCS, all of the clauses and things like that,  I can understand a lot of the verbiage. A lot of the verbiage that has been changed does have to do with administrative versus advisory. Things like developing, things like creating, things like putting into place. That's fine. I can go with that. But when you start stripping away entire sentences in there that are extremely powerful, such as examine reports of discrimination or prejudice.  Examine, and if it deems advisable, make public reports on any complaints of discrimination, tensions, or prejudice filed with or referred to it. Those are being struck completely. And I would love an explanation from the city attorney's office on how those are not strictly advisory in nature. Explain those sentences. I mean, any English majors here, language, reading, comprehension?  Those are literally advisory in nature. There is nothing implicit or explicitly administrative about any of that. The worst part about all of this is that you all end up going on to maintain that  this board shall advise any official or authority on matters involving civil rights or the violation thereof, you change that to it shall provide recommendations on matters involving civil rights. How? How can they provide recommendations when they can't even review or examine reports any longer?  It doesn't feel like this review that was done that we all know why it was done and when it was done. It was because people started waking up because like it was mentioned by Council Member Spadafore, this has been in place for 20 years. Nobody said anything. It just means that people weren't exactly doing what they were supposed to be doing on this board. And when they started to wake up and realize what they could be doing, squashed. And that's what we're seeing now. So how are they gonna provide recommendations?  Are the public still able to take complaints of this nature to this body, to this board? Is that going to be made clear to us?  The fact that there's a blatant attempt to completely remove duties like this, it is a clear message to us that you're removing a very valuable, somewhat objective community-based channel that we can go to for things like this. And we're at a time right now where we have a family that's already sought legal counsel for their 12-year-old black child who was racially profiled and wrongfully detained.  We have a laundry list of issues like this and now you're stripping away the only avenue that we have for us as a community to have some type of support and guidance outside of the police department and the city attorney's office.",2940,3125,"""""",Public Hearing,Commenter,0,1

We're here to request rezoning of the property to allow a collision shop to operate in our building.  The property that we purchased was used for a vehicle repair shop for the last 30 plus years, but was not labeled as a collision shop. It was labeled more like a mechanic shop. We became aware of this fact that a collision shop requires different zoning than what was there previously.  The collision shop does not produce any more noise, smell, or cause anything. It doesn't really do anything more than what was there before. They might have heavier machinery, but everything's confined to the space that's inside. We worked out, my family and I worked out an agreement with the collision guys who essentially own and operate nine collision shops in three different states, most of them being in Michigan.  The collision guys will have to take this building, renovate it, and make it a more appealing building on Cedar Street, which we have a good amount of buildings that either need some work on or are abandoned. They plan on doing more work but waited to see the results of the zoning once we were notified of the zoning requirements.  The building is expecting to get an even bigger facelift than it already has received if and when we get the zoning changed. The building will generate more tax revenue for the city. It's going to bring more business. It's going to give people more options to get their vehicles fixed.  if we get this change made. Making this change will also help Cedar Street by removing an older looking abandoned building and giving it a more life and more appealing to the neighborhood in the area.  Lastly, this place will give people more options for vehicle repairs that already exist in the city. Myself, as the owner of the building, as well as the tenant, we're all willing to accommodate any changes that may need to be made in order to get the zoning changed.

Hate to sound like a you-know-what here, but still. To say this, I think all workers, regardless of their profession, should have a right to proper compensation for all the work that they have done.

LS_08_14_23,SPEAKER_14,"Sure, so we actually addressed this in Committee of the Whole earlier tonight. This addresses, or I should say, deals with a cabaret license  that is held by an individual that owns a suite, or I should say leases a suite in the Logan Square. I'm going to talk about just a few subsections before getting into the actual incident. Chapter 808 of the Lansing Code of Ordinances actually provides for cabaret licenses. And there's a few subsections that are part of that chapter that are relevant here.  First subsection .09 speaks specifically to responsibilities of a cabaret license holder. As an example, it does state that after 11 p.m., all music shall be controlled so the sound will not be audible beyond 100 feet of the building in which a cabaret is located.  Subsection 0.10 speaks specifically to maintaining the piece. And it actually requires the licensee to maintain peace throughout the entirety of the premises. Premises is then defined as not only the structure in which the cabaret is located, but also the parking lot, parking facilities, and in any area or surrounding area within 1500 feet of the boundaries of the lot on which the cabaret is actually located.  So with that being said, subsection 0.08 actually provides for a revocation of a license should there be violations of any of the subsections of chapter 808. Cause for a hearing does require that the license holder be given five days of notice of said hearing. The hearing is intended to provide the licensee an opportunity to present evidence and testimony, to challenge evidence and testimony  This is part of the license holder's due process. A designated hearing officer is permitted to conduct the hearing and said hearing officer shall forward to council proposed findings of fact and proposed conclusion up to and including a recommendation of revocation. A council at that point then can decide to  either disaffirm, affirm, or modify the hearing officer's proposed findings of fact, and can even actually schedule an additional or a new hearing. With that being said, the issue that is before us tonight actually pertains to a recent mass shooting at the Logan Square on July 30th. The Energy Events Center, in this case, is the cabaret license holder. They hosted a party slash kind of concert in suite 41A  222 South MLK, commonly known as the Logan Square. Reports of shots fired came into dispatch at about 1 AM. Ultimately, five individuals ranging from 15 to 26 were shot, two of whom were critically injured at that time. As part of the response, we did have 26 officers from the LPD respond. And due to the size of the crowd and what was referenced as unruly behavior,  we did have to request and receive mutual aid from adjacent jurisdictions. As part of the investigation, we did recover eight firearms, and there were more than 70 spent casings found in the parking lot, along with liquor bottles and other evidence of on-site consumption, such as police body cam footage and the like. The documents provided to council by the chief of police, he also addressed the age of many of the attendees and issues surrounding potential access to alcohol and the like.  So per the resolution that is in front of us, and also discussed earlier in Committee of the Whole, the hearing will be set for August 21st, or 4th, sorry, 1 p.m. here, 10th floor, in the Tony Benavides City Council Chambers. The hearing officer per the resolution will be Elizabeth O'Leary. And the only other thing I wanted to address, there was a comment about Logan Square ownership.  and the fact that there is a broader issue that needs to be addressed by the city. And I couldn't agree more. I do want to clarify that we have filed suit in circuit court, asking the court to declare Logan Square a public nuisance. And my understanding is that there is a subsequent motion being considered where we would ask the courts to appoint a receiver. So with that being said, I would move the resolution.",3630,3877,"""""",Other,Other,0,0

LS_08_14_23,SPEAKER_14,"Sure, and I apologize. Past practice has been to ensure that there was an update in writing. Frankly, there's just not a tremendous amount to update folks on. So we wanted to focus on four areas that we had talked about with regard to the last update  The first would be the fee study, RFP, that we discussed extensively. Also, actually, there's been two RFQPs for a consultant for a top-down review of policies, procedures, things of that nature in co-compliance. Also, we know that there are a number of vacancies in co-compliance, everything from the manager to co-compliance officers to premise positions. And then lastly, we always want to talk about, obviously, the latest and greatest.  red tag numbers, pink tag numbers, and the duration of these tags. As it pertains to the fee study, the RFP was completed, it was issued, and the contract was awarded to Manor Kosteroson. So at the current time, that project is actually underway. Economic development and planning, I actually got with Jordan Hankowitz earlier today. He said that Manor Kosteroson has been sitting down with folks, they've been reviewing documents, having conversations. The department hopes to have something to us concrete  by October. As it pertains to the consult for the top down review, we've had some issues with this. So we actually, again, have issued two different or separate RFQPs. We have not had any bidders. We did have 45 individuals open up, or I should say entities open up the RFQP. And so we actually engaged directly a number of those to discuss issues and why folks are not essentially supplying bids.  It's the scope of the work. It's significant. Folks are essentially referencing the fact that they don't have the capacity to take a project down like that. So at this time we are looking at scope, potentially narrowing the scope, and we should be hopefully hearing back from the department soon. As it pertains to the co-compliance manager, I was told that the process is in the final stages.  and that an offer will be made imminently. I do not know who that individual is, but they do have somebody in mind. They did interview, I believe President Wood was part of that process. They applied, obviously, a scoring rubric, and again, an offer is imminent. And then lastly, this is probably the one that is a little bit most, I would say this is the most difficult to report back on. As it pertains to the red tags, the pink tags, and the duration of tags,  Mr. Jordan Hank, which did tell me that they noticed some irregularities in terms of some of the data they investigated further. And then they, they did identify some inconsistencies in the way that they were querying, reporting the data. So they have actually pulled down. We, we long talked about this public dashboard. So the folks could access those numbers at any given time. They've actually pulled that down as of, I believe, Friday of last week.  because again, there are a number of inaccuracies. So the numbers that we have been sharing, we do not believe probably at any time have been accurate. I want to, I do want to give Jordan and Mr. Nicholas Montree a little bit of grace in that you might recall that when we started to push this and we really identified this as a crisis, they were just coming on board. So they didn't know what they didn't know. They have, in my opinion, done a tremendous amount of work  to write the ship. And frankly, this is a ship that was allowed to steer 1,000 nautical miles off course. And so they are working tremendously hard. But in the process, they are finding that there are issues with a number of processes internally, and they're working to fix. So with that being said, if there are any questions, I can certainly either work to answer those, or I can convey those to the appropriate folks within code for answers.

So, you know, I called non-emergency dispatch, police arrived, saw him, came up to my apartment and just went out on the balcony and the police just sat with him and just talked, stood there and just  and talked to him and counseled him and got him the help he needed.

And on the whole, I think they sound pretty good. I think that most of them I could probably support pretty well. One concern I have is to talk about a building being taller than the Comerica Bank building. If memory serves me, and I could be wrong here, but if memory serves me, there is a restriction  on heights in buildings within a zone around the Capitol that would prohibit anything tall enough to block the view of the Capitol from any direction. So I think that it would behoove whoever's going to be pursuing this opportunity to look at that and see if that restriction is still in place and would it impact these buildings. The other thing I found interesting was these builders, this developer was talking about penthouses.  concierge services, dedicated spaces for meetings and events, and a library and a convenience store on site. And I'm just wondering, you know, where have we heard those suggestions before? Did we hear them in pertaining to City Hall?  From this dais, perhaps we did, if people were listening. Second, the person who presented tonight for the Unity House, I think that sounds again like a good idea. I have two thoughts though, off the top of my head. Nobody discussed parking. And I'm not certain that that neighborhood area can support $50,000 income jobs. So those should be things that get examined a little bit more closely.

What the mayor did with the whole email thing and the endorsement thing, well, there's nothing illegal about endorsements. It was clearly unethical of him to use that email in such a way. And also, it just, what's a better way of saying it? It just showed his favoritism towards some candidates over others, is all I'm saying.

And the fact that his previous email, he used a logo that looked identical to the city logo, that's basically just appropriating a government symbol for your organization is just  That's just reprehensible in all of them. And jury's out on whether or not he actually used city funds to start his leadership fund.

LS_08_14_23,SPEAKER_23,"Good evening, Stan Shuck, South Lansing.  I was at the city operations meeting this afternoon where Mark spoke about the chip sealing catastrophe and what they're going to do. His list of the streets with damage was very short. As a matter of fact, Mr. Garza's area was not on that list. He texted me as I was sitting here tonight saying, well, Andy knows. Andy knows that my area is bad, so they're going to do it.  And I reassured him, well, you weren't on the list.  And there's a lot of streets that weren't on that list. There's a lot of streets in my neighborhood that weren't on that list. Not necessarily on my side of MLK, but Lorain and a few streets closer to Pleasant Grove. All real bad. So, you know, I hope people call in and I hope you'll look at that before you comprise your final list of people that are calling O&M and complaining about that. So they're included at least for looking at what they got.  Andy spoke tonight about the compost and stuff, and I want to tell you something Those seasonal positions a lot of people don't know this it's kind of a hidden secret But those compost seasonals they made forty to fifty thousand dollars a year remember one made fifty four thousand dollars a year and  or one year with the overtime in the fall. And the reason that they're leaving is, like you said, they pay more at McDonald's, but they don't pay more at McDonald's when they're doing the job that they was hired for. They're only paid that when they're not on the compost job. So if you knock that down to 50%,  There's part of your problem. It's an invented situation. They're doing this willfully, in my opinion. And that's why you can't get anybody. Because they take them off of that truck. They take them out of the routes. They pay them $13 an hour instead of the $22. But when you add up the $54,000 a year, $40,000 a year that those seasonals were making, that's a little bit of money.  It's not the wages you would make on 13 bucks an hour. So there's quite a bit of money there. And like you said, you got a full-timer on there now. Well, who's doing his job? Because he's not from the refuse or recycle or compost department. He's from another entity, another part of the public service department. I know who he is. I've talked to him bi-weekly now.  But also the issue of the odor. 1206, your ordinance can't exceed the property lines. You get 15, 20 bags of moldy stuff, and you'd have to put it in the middle of your yard not to smell it at the property lines. So you're forcing people to be in violation of your own ordinance.  This whole thing is bad. You can't go back and hire them jobs and do that work. So that money that wasn't used unless it was intended, you can't go back and do that. That's our money.

LS_08_14_23,SPEAKER_08,"Thank you. Jody Washington, Eastside.  I'm going to start this by saying I am the wife of a retired state police officer. My husband gave 31 years of his life to the police department. So I have the absolute utmost respect for police officers. And I know firsthand the underbelly of society that my husband had to endure and that he still suffers from today. It affects their health. It affects their families. So I'm beginning that by saying  He gave 31 years of his life, and yes, he was a black police officer. Having said that, I am mortified with what happened with that 12-year-old child in our city. There was absolutely no excuse for that. He was crying. His father was there. He did not need to be cuffed, and he certainly did not need to be placed in the back of a police car. They could have stood there peacefully with the father who was advocating for his child  and that child and waited for that officer to show up and just say, he's not the kid. I can't even imagine that a social worker is going to get this child over it. And I will tell you, over 20 years ago, our brown child could not drive the streets after 10 o'clock without getting pulled over.  Our brown child was pulled out of his car, not once, but twice by gunpoint. Our brown child could not come through a parking ramp in East Lansing without being pulled over. We had to tell him that he had to call us every single time he got stopped by the police because he was treated horrifically because he was brown and he was young.  And I am horrified that in the past 20 plus years, there has been no difference. And I would dare say some would say in the past 200 years, we are still seeing the same thing. It's got to change. We have to have smart programs. We have to stop the microaggressions. We have to stop the discrimination. We need to get this together. Our children are dying. Our children are being profiled. Enough is enough.  And as I said, I have the utmost respect for police officers, but this has got to stop. And this HRCS killing of the entire advisory board is just another step in that direction. It was the only safeguard we had to discrimination, and I am the reason  that you are reviewing it. Because when I read the ordinance, I saw the teeth that we had to protect people. And when I brought that forward, now it's all being pulled off. And Joe Abboud literally had the nerve to come to one of our meetings with the changed ordinance and said, this is effective immediately. He never had the authority to do that.

That's correct. The police were there at the wrong place at the wrong time. And you know who else was there at the wrong time in the wrong place?  the knee on Anthony Hulon's neck, who died here in this jail in 2020, months before George Floyd died, or I'm sorry, was murdered. And then when that protest was happening, we saw Andy Schor with the knee down and a fist up, knowing that he covered up that murder. And so I just am like deeply, deeply disturbed.

However, I just want to point to this program that's in Portland that is universally loved among the variety of citizens, including the police and citizens across political spectrum. It's called Cahoots. It is in Portland, Oregon. It is a great program that is often used in reference to defunding the police or whatnot. I would highly recommend you look into it, but this is a systemic issue and not a one-off.  And so I would just encourage you to remember Anthony Huon, who died in the jail underneath the city hall in 2020. And you, city attorney, are the person who told people they couldn't talk about it.

My name's Scott Cobb and for it has been brought to my attention, the atrocities that have been perpetrated against the poor and the homeless of the city for they are told they cannot be here nor there, but given no other opportunity in which to go.  for the shelters are full and they're left outside to survive whatever the weather may be. But there are many abandoned apartment complexes, buildings and red tag homes that could give them protection that they seek and desperately need and deserve. For how is it that we have laws and for animal cruelty, leaving pets outside in the elements, but we turn a blind eye to the inhumane way we treat our fellow brothers and sisters.  For the Lord God said, for he that hath an eareth to hear, let him hear, and he that forbeareth, let him forbear. For God is in control, and for God himself has placed a burden upon these poor and the homeless to test each and every one of us to do what is right in the sight of our Heavenly Father. In Acts 20, 35, Jesus states, for I have showed you all things, how that laboring ye ought to support the weak and remember the words of the Lord Jesus. How is it more?  how it is more blessed to give than to receive. In 1 Peter 4, 8, and above all things, have fervent charity among yourselves, for charity will cover a multitude of sins.  For the Father will judge each and every one of us according to the works and how we treat and support the least of our brethren. For in 1 Timothy 6, 18 and 19 states, they that do good works ready to distribute, willing to communicate, laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come.  that they may lay hold of eternal life. For this issue is soon to get far worse than you can imagine, for we are about to enter the great tribulation. With inflation on the rise, more and more will be forced out of their homes and into the streets. For Proverbs 14, 31 clearly states, he that oprethes the poor reproaches his maker, but he that honoreth him has mercy on the poor. For in Luke,  418, the spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has anointed me to preach to the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering the sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised. For Proverbs 21, 13 clearly states, if a man shuts his ears to the cry of the poor, he too will cry out and not be answered.  For he that layeth up treasures for himself is not rich towards God. For I call upon each and every one of you here today, and those who may hear these words later, to open up your hearts and do what is right in the sight of our Father in heaven, to help all those who are in need of food and shelter, for this is God's will of each and every one of us.

LS_08_14_23,SPEAKER_04,"Hello again, Erica Lynn. I wanted to talk a little bit more about the public hearing that was just set on the changes to the HRCS board's duties. And I just want to again acknowledge that the changes, again, they have a very, very real potential to completely take away any ability for the community to have a  somewhat objective and community-based route for addressing these kinds of issues and complaints. So if the goal, and it should have been when the review was done, but it absolutely should be now, is to maintain the relevance, the effectiveness, and the impact of this board to address community needs and concerns, then there would have been clear efforts in those proposed revisions, especially regarding the discrimination, the prejudice, things like that,  to focus on preserving that board's purpose of providing guidance, recommendations, and support to the community. But most importantly, they also provide us the liaison between that kind of support guidance from community, from us to you all.  So that's extremely important and it does not seem that there was a concerted effort. So we now look to you by way of this public hearing because you are the balance that we need to be able to count on to thoroughly review every single aspect of every change.  because the implications as they are are very concerning. So that is where we're looking to you to, again, it's not like an up-down type situation. It should be a very thorough review of what those changes are, how they came about, why they came about, and what implications they have on the very existence of this board.  I wanted to talk a little bit about the incident that just happened because, I mean, as we all know, people have already talked about this. This was not a one-off issue. We have got to stop pretending like it is. We've got to stop with this Lansing is not as bad mindset because we understand that between 2019 and now, we had a 16-year-old girl that was struck 17 times in the thigh in 20 seconds.  That video went viral. That made the national news. Anthony Hulan was murdered by LPD on the floor of the jail in this building, you know, screaming that he couldn't breathe. That same year, a man was beaten on Baker Street that ultimately was the victim of a fight that had happened, and LPD had to fire an officer for being unprofessional, aggressive, and because he escalated the situation, causing other officers to use higher levels of force.  Just the beginning of this year, a 35-year-old man was shot and killed by LPD. So we've had a lot of dangerous situations. We've had a lot of dangerous chases. We have videos of rights being violated, stop-and-frisk situations. We understand that these are not one-off situations, but we continue to value the PR nature of the way that we govern the city, and this is what we get. And it's only going to get worse because we value how we look more than how we actually are.",7139,7320,"""""",Public Comment,Commenter,1,0

LS_08_14_23,SPEAKER_15,"Good evening. Farhan Sheikh Omar. I want to address two things tonight, one being the entertainment business that's on Logan Square.  You know, we've had over 300 shootings in the city. Um, many of those shootings have taken place in front of businesses, near businesses. And now one time to this mayor or the city attorney or the city council have, have suggested to go off to those businesses. And the fact that you guys are going after a black owned business, um, is very shameful. Um, especially when you know that we've had 300 shootings in the city. Um, that's one two.  our police department. Andy, it's not just one individual, one child that was traumatized this past few days. It's an entire city. On that day, if you were wearing a white shirt and green shorts, you are a target, especially if you're a black person. It could have been me. It could have been Jeff, Mr. Brown. It could have been Brian. It could have been Michael Lynn. It could have been anybody.  Your police officers were looking for an adult, but they ended up handcuffing a child. How does that make sense? As a grown man, as a father, how does that make sense to you? That the suspect is an adult, but they ended up handcuffing a child. And for your police department to say that it was at the wrong place at the wrong time, where is the right place for black people in this city? This child was taking out trash from his house.  Where is the right place for us? Why is that always an excuse for your police department? Wrong place, wrong time, a mistake. It's not a mistake. We're hiring adults to protect the city, to serve the city. And if they can't differentiate between an adult and a child, maybe they don't need a gun.  They don't need a gun. A lot of people have died under your watch, Andy. A lot of shootings have taken place since you became mayor. 300 this year. Over close to a dozen people that have been killed. Last year, over 20 people. The year before that, another 20 people.  The only reason why you're going after this Black-owned business is because we made CNN and NBC. And the only reason why your police department and you are apologizing for what happened to this Black child is because you guys made CNN. Good morning, America. The entire country is talking about you. We've been trying to warn you about this whole situation for years, and you've ignored us. Now we've made national news. Lansing is on the map.

LS_08_14_23,SPEAKER_30,"So just real quick update. I put in the finances for the FOIA request on August 1st. Today is now the 14th, so I believe they're way past their deadline, even with 10 business days in there.  I called today and talked to Matthew Staples. He told me, I'm working on it. And you can go through the process of appealing if you need more time, or if you want to get it. I don't know what it... The point is, why do I have to go through that? Why is it okay for the city to just violate rights, things that are written in law, constitutional rights, just repeatedly, and then I have to go through a process? I want the FOIA request when it was due. They asked for a 10-day extension, they got it.  They asked for what they asked for, I gave it to them. Money, whatever the case was. I want the FOIA, like, tomorrow. And I think that you guys can press that issue. Secondary to that, when we talk about violation of constitutional rights, they've been being violated for years now. And I've been really receiving all of these complaints of Fourth Amendment violations, due process violations, and all of these different things I've been receiving. And people ask, why don't we go and make complaints? But who do they make complaints to now? Because the person who was receiving the complaints is now the HR.  CS, deputy director. So that's just how things move. Like as soon as we get to a point where we're like, okay, we're going to start making complaints. And I've sent people to that woman and she was as rude as any cop that's came up to you on the streets. I've called her and she's been as rude to me.  So the complaint process is just terrible. Again, why HRCS is having that complaint position in place is correct and needed. But what I want to get to is last week they did a press conference and the mayor stood up in tough on crime conversation and talked about how Lansing is no different from everywhere else. If you do this or that or whatever the case is and brought this whole thing because he was called out on social media about the gun violence.  And then our county attorney stood up and said, if you're 13 years old in this city, we will arrest you. We will charge you as an adult. And then we wonder why a 12-year-old gets yanked up like an adult in the streets. This is what you guys are telling the police department. This is what the police chief sat up there and said, if you want to lambast us in the media, and you want to talk about us for political fame and all of these different things, why don't you join us? How nasty that was, sitting right next to his boss.  How is that helping community relations? Then when y'all snatch up a kid, then we say community relations are our top number one goal. How is that? When just a week prior to that, she was telling everybody, you're a kid. Now, I was sitting there watching that. And I got my youngest is 20 years old. And I was thinking, damn, to be a parent of a 13-year-old kid when the county prosecutor stands there, the police chief stands there, and the mayor says, we don't care. We charge your kid as a dog. They going to prison. This is what's being told to the police officers out here.  I'm sure their roll call tells you anybody that looks like this is a danger. We got kids killing kids out here. We all recognize that. But everybody, this is 112,000 people in this city. We're talking about maybe 20 people out here committing violent crimes. And we're setting a precedence for the whole entire black community that they're all criminals and drug dealers and killers. That's scary as hell.  But the fact that we just are able to violate rights the way that we do without any type of accountability is crazy to me.

So that goes to the Board of Water and Light response, and then following that,  the city will have a significant response because we are not able to get into streets until those power lines are cleared and we're given the given the go ahead from the board.

They were backing up in the queue at the 9-1-1 center, as you can imagine. It appears as if the storm moved in relatively quickly.  And then it seemed to hover over Lansing and our region for a while before it blew out. And therein lies a lot of the damage. We had a lot of calls for wires down. We staged quite a bit of our equipment.  as we made a determination on if the wires were hot or if they were cable lines or whatever before we transitioned on. From an emergency management standpoint, right now we're focused on the recovery efforts with the documentation. We did receive a signed executive order from the governor's office  related to our declaration of an emergency, which is a huge first step as it relates to the possibility of reimbursement of our costs. Due to the short staff on the fire department, a number of our folks worked a couple, maybe even three days straight  because of our need for overtime to backfill the positions. We did have a couple members that sustained some damage to their homes. There was some concern there because with that in the back of your mind, it becomes a safety concern because now you are no longer focused on the task at hand.  So we dealt with that as best we could. Right now we are measuring our members as it relates to the emotional toil. We want to make sure and ensure that everyone is good from a mental health standpoint. So we're monitoring that at a very high level. I will be following up with our emergency management.  division staff in the morning, because the declaration from the governor's office came late this afternoon. So we'll determine some of the next steps, which will be working with city finance, ensuring that we have account codes lined up so that we can start tracking and submitting our expenses for the possibility of reimbursement.

LS_08_28_23,SPEAKER_16,"Thank you, good evening, council. To start with, this is the single biggest natural disaster that the board's ever had to respond to. We had, at the height, 35,000 customers out of power, and we restored 80% of them in the first 72 hours, and our goal today was to get to 90%. We were at 88 when I left, so I'm sure that we'll hit that target.  And then over the next couple days, you know, we want to mop up the rest of it.  Restoration efforts were slowed. We had to bring in 40 tree trimming crews to clear the streets so that we could get to the wires. Now our version of clearing is a little different. We just cut a path with front end loaders and that so we could get to these downed wires. Any downed wire is assigned to a board employee in a vehicle to sit on it until we can get there so it doesn't tie up valuable police and fire resources. We had 400 downed wires.  And a typical storm response for us is about 25 crews, maybe 30. We have 100 crews on the ground right now from all over the country.  They've stepped up to help us and we are still struggling with getting into back lots with our tree vegetation crews having to cut through. This storm is different than any storm we've seen before because our lines are trimmed to industry best standards and we don't see these.  complete trees that are 70 feet tall. There's a whole line of trees down out in Delta Township that were 150 years old and it just snapped them off and it took down all our infrastructure. During the ice storm, which I don't like to mention, this will probably be the new ice storm, is that  We lost a lot of wires, but we only lost four poles. We have 41 poles that were down, and we're working on those. A typical pole outage for us is four hours, but some of these poles are at busy intersections with a lot of wires on them. We have pictures of one pole at the corner of Waverly and Willow where four crews were on it for 16 hours to transfer. They're working on these circuits live, and so it takes time.  We have the resources to put this up. We have the material. We were ready. We had a storm call. These crews were on call. They knew they could be mobilized. They got here the next day. And so now we're down to out of the 35,000, we have 3,900 customers that are still out. And we're not sending anybody home other than for the eight hours of rest time they're required until we get them on. We restore power based on the bang for the buck.  You have a series of wires down, so the first tranche is any wire that you put up that will bring 1,000 customers back. Then you drop to 500 customers, then 250. We're right now restoring wires that bring 60 back.  And so that's how it's restored. We don't look at any geographical area. We don't look at anything other than that, because we have to just get in and get this done. And that's how we do it. If, say, we're at the 100 customer per wire, and we have somebody that's identified with a special need, we can move them to the first of the 100.  You'll have maybe 20, I think we had 20 lines down, it would affect 100 customers, and if somebody has a special need or a senior complex that we get a call, they can be number one in that pool, which does move them to the top. So we do that to help out folks that have special needs.  So right now, we have 300 houses that we know of that the mask has been ripped off. We are trying to educate the residents on how the responsibility for the mask up is theirs. We have a mask program. If they use one of our contractors, we have interest-free money to help them do that.  They have to go, the contractor has to get a permit from the city and then the contractor will put the mask back up and we'll come out and hook it up for them. But that's a lot of masks to be down. I've never seen that many masks down before at one time. But I think staff is doing a good job. We've had very good coordination with the city and  I think that's high level where we're at right now, and we appreciate the support and the patience for the remaining 3,900.

That should become clear. We're going to put something out to that so people are aware of that fact that yard waste is yard waste. Those guidelines will stay the same. But for storm debris, kind of tree-related storm debris, that will go out at the curb.  will not be the same schedule because it will probably take us three to five weeks to get through the city based on the quantity we're seeing here and that will be picked up kind of mechanically the same truck we use for bulk waste and other forestry trucks we will basically scoop that up and put it in there and take that  away to Crego Park where eventually we'll have a big tub grinder grind it up, but we will also have another option. We're finalizing kind of time details, but we will open Crego Park up for residents that want to bring their storm debris themselves and drop that off so that can be done in a more timely fashion so we'll have all that debris in one location and when that is all piled up at the end of this  We will grind it up so that information will be on our website. We will put that out on social media and you guys will obviously be copied on that before we're finalizing those details, but essentially two programs. Residents are also.  more than welcome Hammond Farms in Granger, which is where we take our stuff to start with. Residents can drop off there. There is a fee for that. But if they want to get rid of it quickly, or they want to pay someone to get that taken away, then that's obviously up to them. But we will be doing something outside of the ordinary because yard waste is paid for by the yard waste fee.

So if someone's able to take something out there that's six or eight feet long, great, we can pick that up. That's actually better than us than cutting it up to like fire size length and picking it up.  My hope is that people will take advantage of this kind of for what it's meant versus hiring a tree company to come and take a bunch of trees down and they drag it all out or have the tree company drop it at the curb. It's more large kind of storm debris that people are able to take out there. And, you know, obviously people can decide themselves how long they want it to stay there. One downside here versus  With the ice storm is obviously this is during growing season. Grass is not dormant and if stuff is pile of brushes sitting out there three or four weeks, you're probably going to have some grass that dies there.

We had no failures on it. Now, my line department folks told me when I was leaving, they said, though, you might want to consider, you had 300 houses that got the mask ripped off and a smart meter crushed by trees.

It has been accurate the whole time, but I'm not disputing the fact somebody said that they thought their power, we thought it was off. It's pretty hard to tell on the map because we don't identify, when you look at your house on the map,  it's not identified that close because that's a security issue because you don't if you were the only house in the area that had a power outage somebody would know that and it might not be a good thing so I'm assuming that you know the individual asked the question might be somebody lost a mask and you know the media gets smashed the IT said there's no telling what signals it was sending out but  That would be the only anomaly.

And from an emergency management standpoint, we are looking to work a little bit more succinctly with community members  Because if you remember the four phases of emergency management are preparation, respond, mitigate, and recover. A lot of times we don't know what we don't know until after the event. But there are some proactive measures that we can take. We had a couple of our crews that conducted a welfare check at the Colonial Wood  Colonial Wood Apartments because of the issue that we speak of here. There's no backup generator at that facility.  There are a number of residents there that are not necessarily special needs, but have nuances there. I was very, very impressed because the residents there circled the wagons around themselves and their system. There were ladies cooking and passing out food, water. There was a ministry outreach group from one of the churches that was on site, but management was really nowhere to be found.  So from a welfare check standpoint, the fire department definitely will look to become a bit more proactive in that regard. But that level of sweep on the front end is not necessarily built into the emergency plan because of the possibility of a widespread incident where our resources would be stretched thin.

There was overlap between staff duties and responsibilities and that of the board, but also there were some areas that were contradictory.  The city attorney listened very carefully and committed to coming back with an opinion afterwards. That he did. He did present us with an opinion. I got a copy of it when we met with the mayor and talked through what some of the contradictions were.  He then got to work on identifying those areas that needed to be changed. I believe it was Attorney Abood presented those changes to our board. Our board had some concerns or reservations around it. And then it went from there. And so you ask, what did I present? There was an area in June that was presented to me that I asked question of clarification.  but I did not give them any specific changes to make.

It all started with an opinion that is correct, which I issued in December while it was in January of 23. Taking the city charter,  and the functions of the advisory board and the powers that the advisory board has under the city charter, it was clear that some of the provisions of the ordinance that was enacted back in 1997, went a little bit beyond what is required of advisory boards, basically making some of their activities administrative.  So the opinion that was issued, which is an analysis dated January 11th of 2023, which sets out the powers of an advisory board, what they can do and what they can't do. And it's all in that opinion. And I'm sure all the council members have it. And then after I did that analysis, I looked at,  I looked at the ordinances and what violated the charter, and I made recommendations in the ordinance. So it results in basically taking some of the language that is administrative and making it into advisory or recommending. Those are the most of the changes in the first two ordinance amendments that you have. It just says evaluate, recommend.  There were also some names of the department and advisory board that were wrong and it got changed. The last two repealer ordinances, let me start with 08 first, because 08 doesn't really do anything except repeats what the city's position is on civil rights. And that was in 97.  The Human Rights Ordinance was passed in 2006. And that is the Comprehensive Civil Rights Ordinance for the City of Lansing. There's no power granted to anybody in 2008. So you can repeal it or not repeal it, but it's just surplus right now.  2006, I'm sorry, 2006-06 is the other ordinance that's being suggested for repeal. That is the one that sets up a complaint procedure in the advisory board.  but it doesn't give the advisory for civil rights complaints. It doesn't give the advisory board any power to take action, accept it, study, have hearings, and then report their findings to the city attorney. Again, that procedure is set up in the human rights ordinance in more of an elaborate way with civil infractions and a schedule of fines.  So that one can be repealed. That's basically it. And that's where we are right now with the ordinance changes that you have in front of you. So again, the first two.  ordinance amendments clarifies the advisory role versus the administrative role. The third ordinance is the complaint procedure that is really covered by the Human Rights Ordinance now in more elaborate detail. The fourth ordinance, which is a repeal of 2008,  is basically a broad statement of civil rights, which is elaborately described in the human rights ordinance. You could leave it in there or repeal it, it's just surplus. So that's basically where we are.",3961,4215,"""""",Other,Other,0,0

LS_08_28_23,SPEAKER_27,"Thank you, President Wood. I agree with Councilman Hussain 100%.  From my understanding, the board wanted to implement their authority to make decisions and policy changes to ensure that community engagement was fully instituted in the decisions of the department and the voices of our constituents and residents was heard.  If we're looking at saying that the charter does not do that in advisory capacity, then how do we make changes that give people the empowerment, of course, not the, you know, full authority of an employee, but still makes it the reason why we have advisory boards in nature in the first place.  And so additionally, I would like to say, and I agree with Councilman Hussain is if there is a challenge city attorney, then why are we spot checking one advisory board versus looking at how the advisory boards for the city are in place and what we want to do to make sure that they're all uniformly in compliance or to make that change. We're looking at things from an overview and a true perspective versus saying, well, we want to do this and that.  From my understanding, because I was here when that meeting had taken place, was the board wanted to be able to know what their current authority was so they could do their job, why they were volunteering and wanted to be heard in the community. I don't know how that turned and shifted into we need to make ordinance changes or advisory board changes.  quite a bit, and then this came to us. So you said the board, and then you said the director. So in the changes when I asked you last week, you said it was the director who  brought them to you, and my question was, what was the intent to bring these changes? Was it to give and empower the board more, you know, support in implementing why they volunteered, or what was the intent? And you said it was the director, so you weren't able to tell us, and now that's changed. So, you know, that's the whole thing, too. So, I agree with Councilman Hussain on, we really need to look at this, because this  the voice of the people and the decisions being made, as well as human relations community services, a very critical department in our community for our most vulnerable population.

Number one, the first two ordinances just make the changes using evaluation and recommendation. With 06, it's a complaint procedure that just ends up in a report being given to the city attorney.  In 2006, there was a Human Rights Ordinance that is more elaborate on how complaints are handled for civil rights, including civil infractions. In 2008, not 2008, in .08, it doesn't do anything. It's just a statement of civil rights. I just want to leave those thoughts with you.",4868,4915,"""""",Other,Other,0,0
LS_08_28_23,SPEAKER_01,"Yes. Yes. I just want to clarify also that you have an ordinance here that was updated in 2019 that clearly states that the complaints come to the HRCS for our review and to determine whether or not there's enough justification that there is a breach in one's rights.  If once we've identified that, then we send it to OCA. You have another document here that was updated in 21 that said the Human Relations and Community Services Advisory Board shall receive and examine complaints.  So they completely contradict each other. And I guess that was part of the concern that was expressed with the board. They had the document that says that they receive complaints. You have the ordinance that says that we receive them and pass them on to OCA. So there's clearly a need, whether you want to go back 20, 40, 50 years, there's clearly a need to straighten this out so that  that our board can function the way it should be functioning as an advisory board, and that complaints are handled in the way that they're intended.

I want to thank the Board of Water and Light. I want to thank our public service employees. I want to thank the administration who, they were incredibly responsible over the weekend. My colleagues on council, but I think above, you know, probably, I think the thing that was most encouraging is I got out to Churchill or I got out to Leno or Averill Woods or Luton or was the work that the citizens were doing to support one another.

They were doing shout-outs of, who needs this? Do you need debris cleared?  I mean, it was that community that really filled my heart. And so when people knock Lansing, I'm like, that's fine.

I'm just gonna make this very clear right here to you all. I am not in favor of most of these. I think these are just straight up power grab by the execs and nothing more. And I firmly believe in the separation of powers that most government bodies follow, whether it's local, state, or national.  And in saying this about, quote, complying with the state charter, I'm just going to point you to a more federal version of this called the United States Constitution. It is a living and breathing document that's been changed about 27 times. And several of them had to specifically change the Constitution because it was either overstepping its powers or  It had several outdated materials that needed to be changed, such as either only allowing men to vote, only allowing white people to vote, et cetera. And because of that, a lot of amendments had to be passed, such as the 13th Amendment, abolishing slavery, etc.  punishment for a crime, which is a whole other issue, as well as giving black people the right to vote in the 15th amendment, as well as the 19th amendment, which gave women the right to vote. And in saying that, the city charter, the people of city of Lansing can vote for changes to the city charter whenever they think it's necessary. And considering this whole using the conformity with the city charter thing, I'm like,  Considering that this H.R. is going to be on the ballot this November, it is a very ill-timed thing to even consider.

But I want to give you the history, because it goes to what I've been saying up here for the last four or five years. And what you guys seem to be seeing polarizes, as I've ever seen in any situation, is that the city attorney and the mayor and his administration are basically trying to hide any resemblance of community being able to speak in any type of platform where something can actually get done.  And that's what happened with HRCS. So I was at the meeting just by hand. God puts me in places. And I'm not a big holy roller, but I'm definitely spiritual. I know that I'm walking a path. And a lot of times I show up places that I have no idea why I'm there. That day I walked in there, and I believe Adam Hussain was there as well, when the city attorney was to show up and give them their charge. And as I was sitting there listening to the charge and I was reading through the charge, which is in the charter, the only thing that I could think as a victim to this administration was, where was this at for me?  There was no place I could go when I had all the issues that I had, other than to the city's attorney's office, who now I know is in cahoots with them and hiding all the civil rights violations. I had no place else to go. So I went to HR seven, eight times, over and over and over again, complaining about the multiple things. And then during that time, while I was complaining and crying in there and telling them what was going on with me,  I would return to get punished for some odd reason, you know, not having a pen or whatever the case was. So I recognized real quickly they weren't there to help me. HR wasn't. So when I was reading through the HRCS's charge, all I could think was, wow, where was this when I needed it? A place where citizens can file complaints of civil rights violations and have citizens actually investigate it and put forward things and talk to the media about what's happening and going on? Because as far as we know, the city of Lansing has never  had a race problem. Although I'm still waiting on my million dollars for my civil rights violation. It took the federal court and you got refined guilty of. But they've never had a problem. You guys have done study after study after study. Been sued after sued after sued. Getting sued again now. And you can see why. The way the mayor responded to the president of this body. I mean, think about me. This is how their behavior is. What are you going to do about it?  What are you going to do? That's really what they say. Yeah, we're going to do all of this. We're going to violate your rights. What are you going to do about it? And if you ain't willing to go through five years of litigation, have your name tarnished in the streets, get all types of grants taken from you and everything else because he's in back rooms talking about you, then you ain't going to do nothing. I went through that.  I went through that, survived it, and prevailed. The mayor was so confident. I'm positive we're going to prevail in court. This is just one unhappy worker. A million dollars later, he's still saying the same thing. This body has to stand for something. HRCS needs to be a body that's ramped up, not taken down. And that's the conversation in that room, was we need to ramp this up. And the city attorney was terrified, came back, and then now we have this.

We need to have centers in each of the wards of the city, not just in one middle ground. Going to the conversation with the emergency responses over the weekend. I praise everything that got done, including one thing that doesn't get mentioned off in the 911 operators.  who took an abundance of calls in a very short time with a lot of stress. Tying into that, there was some conversation about not having a unified list or map of places where there were people on oxygen, people with CPAP masks, people with medication needs for cooling of their medication or whatever. We have a program called 9-11 Code Red.  That has people listing their locations for those things.

We do need some balance and check some balance in the city's governmental operations.

LS_08_28_23,SPEAKER_31,"Thank you, Jody Washington. I'm the board member on the HRCS board that questioned why we were not allowed to do what we are charged to do as an advisory board. 1.35% of our budget goes through HRCS and that does not include all of the grants and other monies that they are receiving that we never are told of that come through.  It's a dog and pony show with the 1.35% of where we make recommendations of where that money should go and it's time consuming and really needless because then it goes to the HRCS director. She does her recommendations and then it goes to the mayor. We could kind of skip that spot. But it should be an incredibly important board and I also would say  It should be ramped up to a commission with the amount of money and the responsibility that should go through that board. We do need a citizen advisory board for the civil rights complaints. I agree wholeheartedly this should not be done by the administration because everybody has a vested interest. I did ask that the city attorney come and explain our charge. It was never my intent that all the duties would be taken away. It was my intent.  that the board members would understand what their charge was and that the director would understand what the charge was. But what came back was Joe Abboud came back with a very watered down ordinance and said, and this will be effective immediately, which I had to say, you do not have the power to do that. But otherwise, it would have gone through. And so what I'm saying is,  We need transparency in that department, and I'm not saying anybody is doing anything wrong, but it could be a slippery slope very easily. So I would encourage you to not take away the duties because I was actually chastised for doing something that we were charged to do because they felt I was overstepping. I wasn't overstepping. I was doing my job.  So unfortunately, I had enough information and knowledge as to how ordinances work that I was able to scream and holler.

She was asking for clarification to further cement what she knew to be true on what they should be doing. And instead, what the city attorney's office did is they took it upon themselves to go back in what is literally retaliation.  to analyze and then decide what supposedly violated the charter, and then come back and try to implement that immediately. Aside from the supposedly redundant clause that's being stripped, the other one, which is examine and if it seems advisable, make public reports on any complaints of discrimination, tensions, or prejudice filed with or referred to it.  For that to be the one thing that's being completely stripped away, we can obviously see, so I'm not necessarily saying this to you all, but for those that may not have the history, it is just another very clear and blatant attempt to eliminate transparency and accountability. Everything that was just discussed by the city attorney's office and Kim Coleman on why we should do this are both and situations.  Why should the city be the only avenue for something like this? If the goal is to keep this board effective and impactful, why wouldn't we want to strengthen their duties to answer the needs of the community?  Well, I'll tell you why. If we look at history, if we remember back in 2019-20, there was the MIDAC committee. That was the Mayor's Inclusion and Diversity Advisory Council. They completed a whole report with a whole list of recommendations to the mayor about racial issues in Lansing. And there's a lot. They acknowledged that many of them originate in the city.  They ended up having to formally complain at the beginning of 2020 because it went unanswered and ignored for months. And when they finally complained, they ended up being shelved by the mayor completely. What actually ended up happening is  The mayor created a shiny new committee, the Mayor's Racial Justice and Equity Alliance. That was a group of 40 individuals appointed by the mayor and described by the original committee as an elite group of individuals holding secret closed door meetings with a signed letter of confidentiality. Yes, they all had to sign letters of confidentiality.  So I would say to quote one of the members, because six of those members ended up just resigning. Because they understood that this was, again, suppression of the public being able to have a voice in anything having to do with our government.  So in one of the resigning committee members resignation letters, they said, addressing racism and inequity is not going to be comfortable. It's not supposed to be. Our responsibility is to communicate what the community wants and needs and advise the mayor on how to meet those needs. We are not here to make the mayor comfortable. None of us are. We should not be. So again, I don't think you all need this. You've been here long enough. This should not be changed.",7290,7477,"""""",Public Hearing,Commenter,0,1

LS_08_28_23,SPEAKER_00,"Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for your time in this matter for allowing me to speak, for allowing me to give me an opportunity to speak with you today. My name is Sivan Kesto, and I come before you to respectively ask that you grant our request to rezone 3712 South Cedar Street to allow for suburban commercial zoning. My family and I have been very fortunate enough to operate many successful businesses in the greater Lansing area over the past 25 years.  We are stakeholders with a vested interest in the continued success of our city. We consider ourselves unofficial stewards of the city and take very seriously our responsibility to the community. We understand that regulations are the backbone of the urban planning, ensuring that our neighborhoods are well organized, safe, and enjoyable for all residents. However, life is not always black and white, and at times unique situations arise that demand a more flexible approach.  One primary reason to consider our request is that the exception will foster progress and growth. The collision guys, the tenant operating in the space currently, have 11 successful locations across three states and have been in business for well over 20 years. They are I-CAR certified, a designation that signifies excellence and safety, and one that only 10% of collision and body shops possess.  The ownership and the team who put in the work daily take pride in that work and view it as an essential service to the community they serve. Together we intend on renovating and transforming the building and grounds to be more welcoming, visually appealing, and sustainable. The collision guys are confident their business will  will be such a boom to the City of Lansing that they have offered to sign a 25-year lease with a personal guarantee for the full lease term. This ensures an upstanding and tax-paying business will provide services and opportunity to the community for many years to come.  presently the business has been operating at this location for six months and not a single concern or complaint has been voiced by the surrounding community. In fact many in the community have taken notice of the updates and have already taken place at the space and have kindly taken the time to stop in and applaud the investments. The investment to date are only just the beginning.  In conclusion, while zone regulations are vital, they should not stop progress and community development. We must be open to granting exceptions when situation warrants it. We respectfully ask that the rezoning of 3712 South Cedar Street to Suburban Commercial be granted. The building was previously used as a repair shop and the business failed, leaving the place empty.  We've been able to take the same space and use it in a similar fashion, but much more profitably, which is a benefit not just to my family and the Collision Guys' ownership, but to the community. Thank you again for your time in this matter, and I hope that I've been able to convey our vision, passion, and dedication to our community and the City of Lansing. This is an amazing development for the city. Not zoning this property will truly have a negative impact on the community.

In regards to items 26 and 27, one is setting a public hearing on a special land use permit for 415 and 421 West Kalamazoo to authorize a shelter care facility. And item 27 is a rezoning from D2 urban core to a residential adaptive reuse.  As a citizen and active city rescue volunteer, this special land use permit and rezoning request is what the city of Lansing needs to continue to meet the housing and personal needs of our unsheltered citizens. I agree with the city zoning administrator and her overall reasoning and excellent planning process in her report. I encourage the city council to approve this request when it comes up for a vote.  On a second matter, on item 29, the rezoning request for 3712 South Cedar, rezoning from MXC Mixed Use Center to SC Suburban Commercial District. It is not an appropriate rezoning of this parcel of land. Your staff report by Zachary Driver, Commercial Corridor Specialist, recommends denying this request.  This is quote spot zoning, which is a poor practice for the city of Lansing as well as other municipalities. Thank you.",7681,7775,"""""",Public Hearing,Commenter,0,1

But reading this, there's no point to having an advisory board  Yeah, and you're stripping this advisory board of even being able to come to an official or a competent authority and advising them on matters that may be involving civil rights or the violation thereof. Even I would be allowed to do that as a citizen, I think. I mean, isn't that part of your freedom to speak?  The other thing is I am in total agreement with Erica about you can't even now examine reports of complaints of discrimination, tensions, or prejudice filed  with the city or filed, I'm sorry, with reference to these prejudices or discrimination, you can't even examine reports of this, let alone carry out, you know, suggest to the  I'm sorry, Human Relations and Community Services Director, that maybe they should seek some public, I'm sorry, I'm very nervous, make public some of these reports.

I can see where maybe there's liabilities, but I don't, I just don't even see where it's in the charter.  And Adam, I like your idea of making this an administrative board.

One, speaking with the zoning department, the concern was that if  We changed the zoning that we would have to change the zoning for other people up and down the block. And if not, we could be looking at liability. And so it's, you know, changing the whole dynamic. So going from basically zone-based or form-based zoning back to spot zoning. And so that was something, you know, that she was saying. So I asked further questions.  And the questions that I asked was, you know, can you revert it back to the zoning that it currently is if this tenant who is, you know, seemingly great and has a good reputation and the landowner, can you revert it back? And she said, no, you cannot. And then you also  would be in a very sticky situation to make any changes. Going forward, the other thing that she brought up was in behind the building, there's residential property. So when they're talking about this particular zone change, you can do full collision body work and just the full amount of heavy duty lifting. And so if there's any problems with the neighbors or anything like that, it's different than a gas station.  And so I want to support this, but if looking at the best interest from my lens of the city, I can't support it because if it allows everything that's been in place to change, and if that tenant moves on and a bad actor comes in, now we're going to have that problem at this day.

It's not that it's unaffordable to do them. It's just the actual implementation and seeing a grant specifically looking. To figure out how to implement changes. This is  what I've been looking for. I'm incredibly excited to finally get to see, hopefully, actual change. I'm going to be following this very, very closely to make sure things actually happen with it. The second thing I would like to talk about is, briefly, I heard over and over again, talks about spot  Zoning in the city while I do agree spot zoning is an issue. I do want to talk briefly about how a lot of times issues with spot zoning are because The city has tons of different types of zones nitty-gritty details with differentiating as you said the area around it appears to with their  It appears to fit the area just fine. A lot of our zones got way, way too into detail on things where they really don't need to be, and it's just needlessly restrictive. Zones that we have, I think, seven different single family zones, and each one specifies slightly different lot sizes.  Actually, if you look back through the history of zoning in the United States, one of the first cities to largely implement zoning differences was the city of Los Angeles, where they implemented bans on dry cleaners specifically to, for essentially discourage Asian Americans from living in specific places in the city. Zoning has always had these nitty gritty issues in them for discriminatory reasons.  Nowadays, you don't think about it like that, but we're looking back through the history is basically just unchanged. Going back to that. That one reliance is residential zones. The are one zone was originally created for. I believe it was Bakersfield, California to prohibit a black dance hall from being built in a neighborhood. And the zoning code in our books today is still nearly identical to that code way back then.  Obviously, we're not building dance halls too often nowadays. But the point still stands that we wouldn't be having these spot zone issues coming up if we just looked through the zoning code and said, do we actually need to have residential type 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6A and 6B in addition to all these other things?

First of all, I want to say I'm looking forward to bringing my 1956 Thunderbird to the collision guys on South Cedar Street. So I'm excited about that. Second thing, I just want you to know there's a big need in our community, and you know it's shelter. And the City Rescue Mission of Lansing has been around since 1911.  On Thursday night, we sheltered 263 men, women, and children during that storm. And that's what we do every single day. But we're at capacity right now. So for the past two years, we've been looking at ways to expand and meet that need. This is probably the fourth or fifth piece of property we looked at. And I feel like it's the best location. We've always told you, I'll go where the need is. And I think the need is in that area.

I think collectively will do a great job to make that happen there. So we'll go from about 100 men to 200 men. About 50 single adult women to about 100 adult women. And they'll also have free access additional capacity on South Cedar Street for more families.  So collectively, we'll go from about 263 to 450 to 500 people. Now we're funded by our community. So since 1911, we received gifts from God's people in our community, so we don't receive any federal, no state, no city funding. It all comes from  the citizens that support the Lansing area. So we provide services for Ingham, Clinton, and Eaton County, but we are the largest shelter in mid-Michigan. So I believe we have the capacity to expand, but we need your help to make that happen.

For your answer shall be, yea, yea, or nay, nay. For anything more cometh evil.  For all of you here, you have sworn an oath unto man to hold the positions in which you are currently serving, to gain power and control over your fellow brothers and sisters, hiding behind a veil of darkness, perpetuating the evil that cometh from it.  But be forewarned, your Heavenly Father can see right through that veil of darkness to which you choose to hide behind, for He sees and knows of all things. For the ways of man are to oppress those that are in need of help and to hold back the resources available unto them.  For every man has a deceitful heart to retain their wealth unto themselves in defiance of God's will. For even if you choose to walk away from hearing this message, be forewarned.

LS_08_28_23,SPEAKER_02,"Okay, for the record, my name is Linda Appling. I live in the city of Lansing, Eaton County. There are two things I wish to address tonight. First, the ethics question regarding our current mayor. I firmly believe that a special attorney should be hired by the council and that that individual should make recommendations to the council on any ethics questions relating to the mayor. Frankly, I don't trust the city  to make any recommendations in relationship to someone who he reports to. That makes no sense to me. It just isn't even logical. Secondly, I would like to address the emergency situation. And here I'm talking about someone who was the recipient of the services in terms of that emergency situation. And believe me, I'm not the only one that feels this way.  Handling of the recent emergency situation in Lansing has been unsatisfactory, at least from someone who has to receive the services here. I'd like to point out that no provisions appear to have been made for the homeless.  No provisions were made for people needing assistance. No provisions were made to ensure people could recharge their phones. And this is quite serious. I spent an enormous number of hours in my car trying to recharge my phone so I could call somebody. Yet there is no place that you have set up appropriate call centers so anybody can go in and recharge their electrical equipment.  One, no provisions were made regarding fresh water in terms of that. Now, the BWL app was, at best, poor. No provisions existed in terms of you being able to determine any progress that could be made, if you could actually read the app in terms of that. I thought that was one of the worst apps I had ever seen in relationship. Now, I would like to state this.  that your offers of condolences to those who have paid the ultimate price, they fall on hollow ears with me. Why you do not have, the city does not have an emergency plan is beyond my comprehension. Why don't we have one? This is ridiculous. I mean, we had that big ice storm where I had to literally leave and go to North Carolina for five days. Here, if it had been winter, the situation would have been drastic.  in terms of what was happening. I hope that you will develop an emergency plan and not have this piecemeal type of information that I heard this evening come up. It makes no sense that there is no emergency plan. You don't have one and you need one. Thank you.",11177,11352,"""""",Public Comment,Commenter,1,0

LS_08_28_23,SPEAKER_32,"I echo those thoughts that we don't have an emergency plan here. And it's crazy, because after an emergency like this, everybody is up here slapping each other on the butt, talking about how great they did. And there's still people out here without power and all types of other things. And thank you for doing your job is really what it is. But ultimately, to have not a place to somebody. In Florida, when there was a hurricane, my father was trapped in. Every school, every area that could be open was open for people to come.  and get a bed, warm meal, whatever they need in the bathroom. We don't have anything of the kind, and everything is reactionary. And again, Adam had to jump out on social media to get the mayor to respond or act. Just ridiculous, man. With that being stated, and it sucks because this just happened, but the police presence in response to this room is starting to get pretty racist, in my opinion.  I was in this room over the week for a public hearing. There was about 16 people in here listening to that public hearing. And at first DK security was up here for about five minutes and then somebody called the police literally and there was five police in here. It was a quiet standing. Nobody's ever showed up here and done any of this.  Right? So like I don't understand the police response. I don't understand why we have three police sitting back here waiting on whatever to happen. And every week nothing happens. And they could be out on the roads because everybody's talking about we don't have enough police. We don't have enough police. This was 1 o'clock p.m. I believe it was Tuesday. And there was five police sitting back here for 15 people back here. And the only thing that I could come up with is that everybody here was black. Five police. I asked the police officers why they're here. They said we got called here. For what? What's the call come in as?  We have a disturbance. We have black people in this room. I don't know what the case is, but it's really getting annoying. But at the end of the day, administration is going to do what administration does. But the city of Lansing is opening themselves up for 1,000 different lawsuits. And I know that they don't care, but I think you all should. The way that they keep violating people's rights over and over again, and then they're demanding that people, the only option you have is to sue. Ultimately, it is.  You can make all the complaints you want to these people. I just stopped Mark Lawrence for the second time asking about what happened to my email. We are a Michigan registered media outlet that wants to get press releases. We still haven't received anything back. I'm ceasing people on those emails, too. So as you guys aren't replying to me, I will let you all know when I'm getting a response from those. I haven't. Aside from that, I do want to real quickly check on the email.  Two-way communication. I know that was something that got passed. Please do that. Aside from that, First Amendment violations, the mayor has repeatedly untagged himself, or Scott Bean has, from anything posted on social media he doesn't like. And the city of Lansing's Facebook page, which I've done a little research. Case law states that you guys cannot, even on social media, change what I posted or what I write. There's case law on this. So again, you guys open yourselves up for just some lawyer to want to take this case. And here we go again.  The mayor posted when he changed his stuff over there from now on all city related posts will be through Facebook Andy sure if you want to tag me on anything city related whether you're excited about something or have complaints about something you can tag me using that City's email our city's Facebook page, but if you to put anything negative he takes it off.

I know I'm getting a little off topic, but still. Anyways, to say this about what I am going to say is this whole thing with the  that the execs were trying to do with the HRCS. Honestly, I don't know how I feel about it being just pushed back to the committee of the whole. On one hand, I do think that, yes, this meeting has gone for quite long enough, and I do think that it should be discussed at a later date.  But also I think this should, I do understand why I think this should have been struck down immediately because I mean, to say this again with the whole conform with the city charter thing, considering that the city charter is gonna be on the ballot, this is just really ill-timed and I don't know if there was any time to strip any board of any kind of their powers in any way. This is just,  This is basically just, um, abuse of power in almost every single way. And it's just a blatant power grab. And to say this again about the city charter, the state charter is a living, breathing document that citizens can vote on to change for every 12 years. And even independent of that, people can put measures on the ballot to change parts of the city charter to  changed to change the way things are. Like, let's say the organization of wards, or should we have at-large positions? Some of the things I have been pushing. Again, it's a living, breathing document that can be changed over time. And if, let's say, the people actually do vote on opening up the city charter and creating a commission, I'm wondering if these things are just going to become straight up irrelevant and are just going to age even worse.  And that's why I support opening up this H.R. And also in addition to that, I may also consider if this, should it either fail or if I, since I may fear this might fail, that I'm probably considering probably working with you council members to get something on the ballot to get rid of the at-large or reducing it and either increasing it to six wards or 2D each ward or just eight wards in general.  Either way is better than the current status quo. And all I'm going to say in the end is, we have a separation of church and state and we should not be forcing our religious views on others.",11568,11741,"""""",Public Comment,Commenter,1,0

You have not been able to come. And I appreciated the comments that you made tonight and the questions that you asked. Very valid, very important, very valuable. And it's also important for you to go to the ones, the Ad Hoc Committee on Homelessness, because you are committed to do the things that you're appointed to.  And at least at the ones that I've been able to attend, they haven't had a quorum so they couldn't approve the minutes or anything else. So you missed a lot of really important discussions because they've been doing a good job trying to cope without a quorum and having good presentations, valuable presentations. And I also want to thank Council President Carol Wood because you spoke from the heart and you held our mayor's feet to the fire. And we needed that to happen.  Because when we don't have a city charter that has the mayor just doing ceremonial things like ribbon cuttings and smiling and shaking hands and going around. Actually, Mayor Schor is very good at that kind of job, but there's a lot more in managing a city. And when you put a politician in charge of managing the city, you get what we got, garbage.  He's been bought and sold by the economic development people, as if the people of counseling don't matter at all. And that's wrong. That's unethical, and it won't happen with a city manager who is sworn to an ethical code. And I personally will be grateful when our city attorney retires, because I'm not an ageist, but you do seem to be operating on some very old-fashioned rules. There was a wonderful presentation at the Committee of the Whole. And if you had attended it, you would have learned about all the wonderful things that they're doing under a grant through the MPHI. And they're going to have a public hearing on public meeting to report on the progress of their grant. They're 10 months into an 18-months grant.  And it's time that the city of Lansing knows about the wonderful work that they're doing based on evidence-based practices. And their goal is to end circulatory and retaliatory gun violence. I think we all want that. I think we all need that. So find out how they're managing to do that, at least according to the data that they've already had. And it's already on the website. You can look at it month by month.  And I want to point out that I'm a member of a condo association and we're billed taxes twice because we have to pay to our condo association who manages all of the trash collection and all the recycling and all the tree management. And guess what? Even though we pay taxes, we don't get those services from the city of Lansing.",11756,11944,"""""",Public Comment,Commenter,1,0

But I believe the time has come for the city of Lansing to change the practice of its key city leader and administrator. We need to change to a city manager form of government and leadership. Advantages to a city manager form of government include  Neighborhoods strengthening their voice, the power of special interests is diffused, and we can have more merit-based decision-making versus politics. Furthermore, the city manager form balances the power structure within the city council with the city manager directly accountable to them.  And it creates a more of a partnership with the city council and provides more consistent leadership for years to come. These Michigan cities have city managers, Grand Rapids, Kalamazoo, Wyoming, East Lansing and Ann Arbor. These are medium sized cities that benefit from a city manager. Now, there is a process to move forward. I understand this would require a change in the city of Lansing charter with both legislative and voter approval.  Therefore, I am in favor of a review of the city charter as a step in this process.",11955,12045,"""""",Public Comment,Commenter,1,0

You don't have any compost employees.  And you don't have any trucks. He sat right here and reported it to you. And he sat right here and told you just the opposite. So I don't know how that's going to happen. But I want to go on about this compost. When he was down here at the last big meeting and you had him, he did nothing but collaborate everything I said. Everything. You don't have the employees. You're pulling employees from other areas.  You're taking the money and you're putting it in an account. You've got more money than should be in there. And why? Because the services aren't being provided. That's the only way there could be extra money in that account, is if services weren't being provided. Nobody mentioned the sweeping. Nobody mentioned the catch basin cleaning. Nobody mentioned the leaf cleanup in the fall.  None of that was mentioned. And everything, like I said, everything he said, the trucks, he said that the trucks, there's money in the fund to replace two trucks every two years. And then he told you the trucks are 21 years old.  How does that happen if you got the money to replace trucks every two years? How do you ever get a 21-year-old truck? By not doing the things that the fee pays for. It's fraud, and it is blatant. It is blatant fraud. I just was in a court case today for commingling of funds, and that's what you're doing. You're commingling those funds, and you need to reevaluate the recycle fee for the actual cost. He didn't go over any of that.  He smoke-screened all the way around it, just like he sat here and smoke-screened his way right through this whole storm disaster. And the mayor, he didn't mention the City of Lansing employees when he thanked the responders. Why? Because he only had 11 of them working. The forestry crew, seven guys, and four truck drivers. That's why. Every available resource, hardly, hardly.  And Peter, I want to ask you, you had a meeting today. I was at a meeting a couple weeks ago, and Mark was asked to contact Meridian Township, ask them why they road milled and about their chip sealing catastrophe, and that he would report back to you. As far as I understand, that report is still forthcoming. Also, September is right here at the end of the week. Still no door hangers, information on what they're doing with the chip sealing.  It is as bad as it's ever been. There should at least be some knowledge of what process is going to take place with the chip sealing. But the composting, that's fraud.

I came here in 73, and I ran away from home when I was 13. And I lived out on my own and came here after I graduated from high school at 17. And I've been in Lansing now, like I said, for 50 years. And some of the things that I have done in this city with the help of my good friend Jean Macklin, rest her soul, I  struggled as a young person, and my whole life has been about the youth. When I ran away from home, my mother couldn't tell me nothing because I was 13 and I knew everything. Came here, did a lot of things, implemented smoke-free campuses for the hospitals, Gene, Macklin, and I. Thirdly, I have an issue with our youth today. I was a youth.  And the problem is that our youth have nowhere and nobody to turn to. I didn't have nobody to turn to when I was out here on my own. And I came to this city with no kin people, nobody. But I say this to you all tonight. I put a challenge before you for our mental health youth.  Is there any reason, and I challenge all of you tonight, including the mayor, and he's not here right now. Is there any reason why we can't utilize St. Lawrence Hospital as a youth place for all of our youngsters right now that are having problems? I challenge any of you to take me on to help me because I know how to go about getting things done.  And our youth today, we're losing them. And we're losing them at a rate that we have no control. So if we can't get in contact with Sparrow, use St. Lawrence to do what we need to do with our youth, it'll make us a better place. Now, the reason I'm really here, and I only got a minute left, is my trees. Now, I came here about a month ago and asked you that, yet, y'all own the trees, but y'all left me with the stump.  And I just walked out because I knew that it was funny to everybody, but it's not funny to me because I have a problem with knowing that I'm a landscaper.  If you look at the folders that I gave each and every one of you, I showed you what I did with the city when they came out and cut my tree down. I made it look gorgeous. But also, I was able to take the tree that came down Saturday, if you look at the pictures  and pass them around. The last two trees that you're looking at are the two that failed this year, as you can see how I decorated them. All I would encourage you all to do, we have a whole bunch of landscaping people in this city. Why not contract them to teach all of us and share how we can make our stumps look beautiful and not just lean. Thank you. Thank you, sir.",12242,12436,"""""",Public Comment,Commenter,1,0

I'm the current Churchill Down Community Association president. Last Thursday, August 24, a tornado ripped through Ingham County. And it devastated a number of neighborhoods, including mine. Upon initial assessment, I wasn't able to clearly put my thoughts together, let alone words. The devastation throughout the Churchill Down neighborhood is shocking and frequent.  Every other turn there's another tree down, a power line down. Trees and power lines on roads as well as on people's houses. I have been a Churchill Down resident for 10 years and I have never seen this neighborhood come together like we have and continue to do so in the midst of Mother Nature showing us her ugly head.  Neighbors making makeshift charging stations for all to use, neighbors passing out food and water and ice, neighbors making food runs to make sure everyone had something to eat, neighbors helping each other with yard cleanup and just interacting with one another assessing the damage.  I want to publicly thank Adam Hussain who shared multiple updates in state and communication throughout the entire weekend and continue to do so. When I say thank you to Adam Hussain, what I'm saying is there was a resident that needed electricity for oxygen. He actually mitigated that issue, I believe it was Friday, so he got things done. I also want to say thank you to Councilman Jeffrey Brown.  He contacted me Thursday night to check on me and our residents, as well as through the weekend. So thank you guys.

LS_09_11_23,SPEAKER_01,"Good evening, city council. My name is Dion Freeman. I'm from Flint, Michigan, and I am here today to ask for the council to carefully consider revoking the cabaret license of the Energy Event Center. I have known Ryan Cabell for over 30 years. In his 20 years of having events in Flint and his 10 years of holding events in Lansing, he has never had any type of violent crime take place until now.  This says a lot about his ability to hold safe events. Ryan is an upstanding citizen. He doesn't even drink, smoke, or indulge in taking any type of illegal substances. I took the time today missing my own city council meeting in Flint just to voice what my concerns are, just like so many other people's concerns. I couldn't make it here today. It has been made known  by certain people that in Lansing, there are many that don't support the management of Logan Square. I feel like some of this attempt to revoke the license is an attempt to thwart the dislike that they have for the venue's owner onto someone who abided by the regulations. Well, let's just say he didn't comply with every regulation. Immediate revocation is a harsh and unfair sentence. Every punitive system has stages. Some includes warnings.  Many may include contingency plans moving forward. Immediate revocation is not a fair action to this businessman who has invested time and much money into the venue and the community. Please search your hearts and be the type of city officials that will help small businesses and minority business owners to have success. Be a council that is firm yet fair. Give Ryan Cabell and the Energy Events Center a chance to thrive.  give him the chance to survive socially and economically. Revoking his license will hinder his economic freedom and pursuit of happiness and the ability to recoup costs that he invested into the facility. I would encourage the council to work with the police department to ensure that they are more responsible for cruising through these types of events. Having a police presence at these large events will help reduce some criminal activity.  Come up with a solution that is not so extreme in action. And I was here earlier, and I was going to ask you to please postpone your decision until all the questions were answered. And you guys have already done that. So thank you for listening.",1842,1999,"""""",Public Hearing,Commenter,0,1

LS_09_11_23,SPEAKER_25,"So I have a different take on why you all postponed that. And I'm hoping I'm not correct. But Peter, coming up with a postponement means to me that I don't think you guys felt you had the votes to vacate it. There's two people missing from here with Spitzley missing in, with Adam gone. And I just figure you thought this was going to get thrown away. You don't need any more time. We've had all the time you need. And I think for somebody who's been in this situation, who's  to come in here for these dates and so on and so forth. For the person that owns the place that has to come to this, it's stress that I can't even express to you all. Since I've been sitting here, my heart rate's spiked five times. I've been told my heart's going to explode one of these days from the stress of all that I've been through personally. So I know what it means to hear, you're going to have to wait another week for an outcome here. So I don't think that was as good as some people might believe it was to push that down. When you guys could have either placed it on file or made a decision today, you know the right decision to make.  Outside of that, Ryan Cabell being called to the table, the first that we hear his name, I think it is true. As she said and as Ryan and most people did, you guys have a problem with Logan Square and so do we. I think we're all in agreement on Logan Square needs some changes.  I don't think that Ryan Cabell is the reason why that is, again, but I find it really funny that he got called to the table with such an extreme outcome as soon as he did, given the fact that, as you all know, with our advocacy, we've been trying to call certain individuals to the table for even some form of accountability whatsoever.  To think that he's here for violating a cabaret ordinance and it's already on the table for eviction or to take a revocation and we have, you know, the mayor who has violated multiple ordinances over and over again. You all know it, we know it, and there's been no process whatsoever up to this point to give any type of  accountability to him. As you all have seen, we've gotten some of the FOIA requests back for the issues here with the ethics violation. If you need to take some history, Lightfoot, I believe her name is in Chicago, had the same issues and violated their ethics ordinance. If you need information, I can send that to you for the exact same thing. We're still now, even after this council has demanded  that the city attorney release all of the FOIA information to us have still not received that FOIA back. They're violating, violating laws. But they don't care because go ahead and take us through the process. What are you going to do, sue us? They don't get an immediate response the way Ryan Cabell gets immediate response. If we had immediate responses for that office and that administration the way Ryan Cabell was pulled in here, a lot of stuff would get done in an absolute amount of time.  So we don't need to kick that down the can while we're waiting months and months and months for any accountability for people who have wide open in front of your guys' faces violated ordinances in that same charter. Still haven't heard a response back from the city attorney. I still haven't heard a response back. And as we're sitting here, Mark Lawrence, have you received any of my emails about my First Amendment rights and getting press releases?  I've emailed you, I've CC'd the City Council President, I've CC'd Adam Hussain, I've CC'd the media. This is how they respond. Thank you.",2011,2198,"""""",Public Hearing,Commenter,0,1

LS_09_11_23,SPEAKER_22,"Good evening. Farhan Sheikh-Omar. One thing I want to talk about tonight is due process.  And I believe due process is a fundamental principle of our justice. And the Energy Center was never given any due process. When you have a mayor who goes out there in public and says that he wants this business shut down, and then you guys hire one of his employees to conduct the investigation, you guys have denied Mr. Cabell his due process right. And so that is, I don't know how anybody can sit here and make  a decision based on the investigation that was, that has been conducted by one of his employees. What, what exactly are they supposed to do? If your boss tells you to do something, you do it. That's just the truth. And so this entire investigation is flawed. I believe personally, and I know many people won't say this, it is racially motivated. I'm not saying it's you guys, but it is very clear.  We've had over 300 shootings in the city and not once did the mayor go after any other business. We've had shootings in front of Tin Can. That's why every Saturday you have five, six cops out there. We've had shootings in front of the Lugnuts Center. You've had shootings in front of the Lansing Center. You've had shootings in front of the Capitol building right here recently.  You've had guns that were stolen from 517 gun range, although that's not in Lansing. We've had many issues in this city and not once have we gone after a business. And so the fact that we're doing this to me is nothing more than a political stunt. This is a political stunt by a mayor who doesn't have  a vision who doesn't have a strategy, and his police chief is just as clueless as he is. And so the only thing that he can do is say, you know what? I went after this business. Let's just say you guys do revoke his license. Then what? The shootings are not going to stop. You know how I know that? Because we've had 10 shootings after that shooting. Four people have died after that shooting. And more people are going to die after you guys or if you guys decide to revoke his license. So let's not kid around. Let's not play around.  You know, this is a real issue. Lives are at stake. Let's come to the table with solutions. We know this isn't going to solve the problem. It's been, we've been dealing with this for a long time. And so I hope we get serious about the gun violence in this city and not give a political stunt victory to a desperate mayor who hasn't done anything since he's been reelected. And so I hope that this license is not revoked.  I wanna see you guys, I wanna challenge you guys to come up with solutions on how to truly end the gun violence in this city, because taking his license is not gonna solve the issue, and we all know that.

The report on cooling and warming centers to my thinking, if we're going to need warming centers because it's too cold out, it's cold during the daytime and it's cold at night. And if we're going to need cooling centers because it's too hot out, it's hot during the day and it's hot at night as well. People that don't have air conditioning can't cool their houses at night by opening windows if there's no breeze.  So we need to look at providing 24-7 coverage when the conditions permit or are required. They aren't required 800 days or 800 hours or 500 hours or whatever a year. You might have a total of, say, between the two, you might have at the most maybe 45 days where you need to provide heating or cooling to the people who are in need of that service.  We have community centers. All four of them from each ward could be utilized. They're already open during the daytime. They're already staffed. They're already utilitied.

Use the facilities you have, the staff you have, the utilities you're already paying for, and just keep them open at night when the requirement is there.

I've been homeless for almost three years because my house flooded and code compliance just threw everything away, including my dad's ashes. Like they just came to my house because my neighbors complained  75 days in a row. I wasn't doing anything illegal. They completely put me out, got ticketed, got arrested, and everything, cleaning my own house on my own property because my neighbors bullied me out of my house because they hated me. So I go out there every day. I clean up trash. I clean up all this debris. I clean up syringes behind the homeless. No, I'm sorry, the bums, because there is a difference between homeless and bums. Homeless clean up after themselves. The bums leave these big, huge messes, and we all get lumped together. I know both sides.  The only issue is that they have no toilets, they have no showers, they have no electricity, and they have no way to cook food. So if you put, let's say, a shower next to a port-a-potty somewhere,  They wouldn't have the problem of having to use a bathroom outside in the bushes somewhere, putting God knows what into the atmosphere, because trust me, drugs do not just disappear.

I clean up syringes, because there's no place to dispose of them. They just throw them everywhere.  There's not enough trash receptacles. And if we had, let's say, a year-round bathroom for them to use, it'd be a whole lot cleaner around there, because they prefer to not poop in the woods, guaranteed. Nobody likes that. The middle of the city is really busy. And it's just something small like that would make people feel less degraded. It's like they have to dig in the trash for their food already, because the businesses treat everybody like they're disgusting, like they're nothing.  And they make sure that you feel that way. Speedway specifically moved their ice machine to block their plugs so you couldn't charge your phone outside anymore. They locked their bathrooms because people go there because it's the only place they got to go and use their illicit drugs. But that's not everybody. That's one in a million. So you lock everybody out because of it. The businesses around there shun you. They make you feel like a complete garbage, especially Old Town. Like, none of us even go to Old Town anymore. And they think that it's cool that they can push everybody out.  But we're not there to cause a problem. It's like we have no other place to go. I had an $80,000 house kicked down the street because my basement flooded and my roof leaked because the inspector didn't do his job. Co-compliance, when I told them there was proof of me and my niece being assaulted in this big pile, didn't even bother to call the cops. She just said, oh, nice ironing board, and kicked me out after I let her in. I told her my dad's ashes fell off my neck. They're in this pile of debris that I can't find. They scooped him up and threw him away into this rash. That's what I got from co-compliance.  The officers didn't care. The chief of police said there was an arrest on site warrant for me because my neighbors called the cops every single day that I was there for watering my grass or putting a pole up in my yard. They didn't get in trouble for that. Because what? I have a mental disorder. I am on disability. I have bruising on both sides of my brain. And I still held down a job and still bought a house with my two kids just to have my neighbors throw me completely away.",3634,3819,"""""",Public Comment,Commenter,1,0

LS_09_11_23,SPEAKER_26,"My name's David Bashaw. I've lived in Lansing pretty much all my life. My mother was a secretary, or worked for Secretary of State for 25 years before she retired. And she took me to a lot of political functions just to meet people and do different things. And she said, if you ever have a problem, all you have to do is go talk to City Hall.  I tried that on just going to one person or the other instead of coming to a meeting and never got anywhere. They don't listen to you. She passed away and one of her friends, one of her friends, Alfreda Schmidt, she invited me to come to a council meeting  I wasn't a person that really liked to speak in public. But over the past 15 years, I've just watched this whole city go down the tube. I left town for three years, come back, and everything's gone, all the plants. And nothing's been done to replace anything. It looks like a wasteland.  The friends, I mean, were very well off, I find, living in the streets. And there's no real explanation for it. Thousands of empty houses. Nobody's doing anything. They condemn them. They tear them down. The building's going to be fixed. They just sit there. And the city's doing nothing about it. It used to be, well, you  and done something with it. What happened to that? All these people sleeping in the streets and all these empty houses. And... Yeah, a lot of the people, I mean, I've even gone in and offered just to help fix some of them up for free if they put the homeless in there. Oh, that's against policy or that they can't do it. Yeah, they can.  OK it. We're going to mirror it. There's a drug rehab center on Willow Street that's been empty for five years. It would be a perfect homeless shelter. The Logan Square Mall would be another one. How many people could you house in that instead of wasting that empty space? Because I know if there's four stores in there running heat, it's heating the rest of the building.  Um, Mr. Cobb has done a good job of laying.

There's a lot of people in our community that are hurting. There are a lot of issues that our city is facing. And it might seem that I come here every two weeks and I've got an agenda. I'm building a narrative or whatever it is that people may say about me. And you're damn right. I do have an agenda. Our people, our city.  Our city is something that we don't even recognize and I cannot help to just understand and know why. When you allow corruption at the highest levels of leadership, this is what you get. You get a hurting city, a dying city, a city that is just struggling to stay above water.  What I actually came up here and I hope I have enough time to, but it's okay. You guys will have it in your inbox if you don't already. I filed, I talked about an ethics complaint that has gotten misconstrued in so many different ways and it has transformed into something that we're now just skirting responsibility at this point. So I am now formally requesting that the city council revisit the motion that you all passed on,  The opinion that was given by the city attorney's office specifically Jim smirka to seek outside counsel in reference to that opinion that was  put on the table by Council Member Spitzley. It was supported by Council Member Hussain, and it was passed unanimously seven to zero at the 7-24-23 Committee of the Whole meeting. Since that motion carried, the next step was going to be to review the outside council list and then take recommendations. But at the 8-14-23 Committee of the Whole meeting, that discussion completely derailed.  It got completely off of the tracks and it was made completely and utterly confusing by a simple question that Pat Spitzley asked pertaining to my potential ethics complaint.  That motion has nothing to do with my potential ethics complaint. So whether or not I, as a little old citizen, decide to move forward with that process should have no bearing whatsoever on you all seeking outside counsel, because as you all stated publicly in that meeting, you did not agree with that July 10th opinion by the city attorney, Jim Smirka.  The fact that question number four pertaining to that opinion was, are campaign funding communications a violation of the city's ethics ordinance? It was given a resounding no in that opinion. You all disagree with that completely, clearly. You discussed it.  but they only address the finance issues and not all of the rest of the concerns that you all talked about in front of us and discussed publicly. That should be enough to move forward with that outside council. So I would like for my potential ethics complaint to be completely separated from these discussions. It has no bearing on this body's original concerns when you passed that motion. That motion needs to be put back on the table. We don't get to just act like it didn't happen.",4121,4306,"""""",Public Comment,Commenter,1,0

LS_09_11_23,SPEAKER_25,"So eloquently put by Erica Lynn, I think you all know that needs to come back out. And I appreciate her separating the two, because our ethics complaint, even though all those signed by you all, is going to go to a completely different place.  What I want to say to this council is that I'm proud of you all for what you guys have been able to do. And I'm going to look at this side of the table here. I'm proud of you all for what you guys have been doing up to this point, honestly. I think that you guys are recognizing when I always talk about like having a thief in the house and your stuff just keeps coming up missing instead of just keep asking the question of why or where it's going, you're recognizing where the problem is. I've seen the back and forth, and I've seen people really trying to hold accountability.  The world is watching this. I mean, I think that's pretty apparent when the email that we're talking about soliciting funds only brought in, I think, $1,000 from a city that elected this guy twice. And then the person who was the only candidate endorsed is dropped out now. The window's tightening up. It's tightening up. It's getting really tight.  After looking through just the 256 emails that we received from the city attorney, can't even believe they actually gave us a couple of them. There's absolute ethics violations that I probably remove him from his position, but who's going to do it? That's the question. So as I'm really concerned about our timeframe here for what you guys are talking about and getting results back from this stuff before they wipe this council out and bring newbies in here. I think the city is watching it all, you all.  have got to take a concerted effort to bring accountability. If the top brass, the absolute person in the city who has the most power is not ever held accountable, you know how that floods out throughout the city. And that's the issue.  So just as if, like I said, just small things, not returning emails, not releasing a FOIA after it's been appealed and the city council president tells you to release it. These little issues like this that are right in your face, can you imagine the things that happen when it's not in your face? Can you imagine the things that are happening behind closed doors that you may not see when they just have a complete void of law or concern about anybody filing a complaint or any of those things when they know the complaint goes to their inside folks and so on?  You guys are the only stopgap that we all know is the problems that we all know are here. And I'm not chastising you because I know I've had conversations. People are really worried about where to turn. Where do we go? We all know that this stuff has happened. Where do we turn? Brian T. Jackson didn't sign and I think one of the reasons why is because what's going to happen? We finally did all this stuff wrong and then what? Let's answer that question now. Trump is finding his day right now.  You know, he went through four years of this thinking he was lawless too. Let's answer that question. What now? We've released emails already to this point that are clear violations of the ethics ordinance using company time and resources for campaign stuff that you all have already seen because most of you follow America.

LS_09_11_23,SPEAKER_17,"Good evening, Mayor, City Council, and all attendants tonight. Let me paint a very vivid picture for you as to how you treat your poor and the homeless here in your city. For you tell them they cannot be here nor there and give them no other opportunity in which to go. For they set up their camps in a new location each time only to have the cops show up and tell them that they have five minutes to vacate, leaving behind what little they have to escape persecution before  being forced out of what little protection in which they have from the elements. Now just imagine, Mayor and City Council members, if this were happening to you. How would that make you feel? To keep losing everything you own and to have to find another location in which to stay. For does this saying come to mind? Do unto others as you would have done unto you?  For trust me, for there is a much greater power who is going to do just that, for he is your heavenly father. For if you do not lend a helping hand to those that are in need, that hand will surely be cut off from reaching out to your heavenly father when you yourself are in your time of need. For Proverbs 21, 13 clearly states, if a man shuts his ears to the cry of the poor, he too will cry out and not be answered.  For Proverbs 14.31 clearly states, he that oppresses the poor reproaches his maker, but he that honoreth him have mercy on the poor. For Luke 14.11 clearly states, for whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased, and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.  But be not dismayed at who stands before you here tonight in the words in which he has given me to preach to you, for I know who I am. For he has chosen me for this appointed time to give you all a stern warning of the things to come.  For the Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor. He has sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering the sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised, to preach an acceptable year of the Lord. For my Father has told me, if I ask, I shall receive. If I seek, I will find. And if I knock, the doors will be opened up to me.  For I ask you, Mayor and City Council, to give me and my followers a safe place to dwell in your city. For we ask only out of need and not that of want. An abandoned apartment complex would be just fine for us to be free and live according to God's will, to be left alone and to be taxed.  no more of the burdens in which you place upon us. For if you wish to see us here no more, you will grant that in which I ask. For if you wish to deny my request, I will ask my Father to deny you in the days to come, and He will judge each and every one of you according to your works. Make no mistake, for I know whom I am, and I forgive you today, I pray.",4522,4722,"""""",Public Comment,Commenter,1,0

LS_09_18_23,SPEAKER_02,"There you go. Good evening. I'm Randy Barton with the City Rescue Mission, the Senior Director of Operations there. I've been working there for over 10 years and have been a Lansing resident my entire life. During that time, both professionally and personally, have seen that there has been a dramatic increase of the homeless population inside of Lansing.  During the time of the city rescue mission, you recognize that every face is a person. It's not someone that may do things that others would claim. And we found that many folks, the majority of the folks that we serve are people just as you and I.  City Rescue Mission has been around since 1911. We're now in our 112th year of operation of meeting the needs in Lansing. We focus on three things, food, shelter, and the hope of the gospel of Christ. As a religious organization, we hold to our faith and we service folks of all faiths, all walk of life, every walk, creed, orientation. We welcome them inside of our doors. But we've seen that the need continues to increase.  We have noticed that the need increases, and we are grateful that we've been equipped to help meet that need. Of the Lansing area, we have over 4,500 different individuals that keep us privately funded. Individuals, businesses, churches, all support us to allow us to be able to do what it is that we do.  and we continue to do more. In 2019, we were servicing somewheres around 135 individuals each night, providing them with food and shelter. Fast forwarding to this year, we are now looking at near 250 individuals each night, and the need continues to grow.  The numbers that have been provided in the packet given to you show that last year we were serving roughly 123,000 meals. This year we're on track to do 136,000 meals. Last year as we did 72,000 nights of shelter. This year we're on track to do 90 nights of shelter. No matter if we look at a few years back till present or last year to present, we see the need continues to grow and grow.  We're willing to step up and meet that need. We're willing to stretch and to do more. But our dilemma, as we continue to operate above capacity, is that we have recognized that we're going to have to leave the locations that we're at now and seek a new location. We've spoken or we've looked at many locations around town.  There's been different reasons that they did not work out, but we found a location at 415 and 421 West Kalamazoo that we think would be a good fit for us, a good location inside of the community to help meet the need that continues to grow. Our goal is not to bring a problem, but rather to alleviate concerns that already exist and grow to meet what is likely will be a greater need even yet in the future.  We know we provided you with the layouts of the building, some of the tentative design ideas. If you'd like, we also have an even updated version of that that we'd be happy to provide for you at this time if you'd like it.  But I'd like to point out the fact that even beyond anything that we discussed tonight, there's new information as well, that we are excited to have the go ahead to present this evening as well, that we're in talks now to work on providing medical care facility at this location as well. One of the increasing things we need, we see within our homeless, those experiencing homelessness, is that there are increasingly aged group that have unique medical needs.  One of the things we see oftentimes in communities is that people are even experiencing more chronic disabilities because of lack of medical care. And if we were to get the rezoning to where is necessary to operate the shelter, we'd be able to provide food and shelter on location.  We'd be able to provide medical needs on location, and this would also allow even for greater meeting the need that that would free up other of our locations, specifically the women and children shelter at 2216 South Cedar Street, to become wholly a family shelter, thus doubling or even more than doubling its current capacities. By moving from our current locations, our goal,  Our five-year, six-year, seven-year, depending on how quickly things can move along in multiple phases, would be to make the 415 and 421 West Kalamazoo Street property that for single adults, where we'd be able to see our capacities more than double. Also, with moving our single ladies to that location, that would also allow our family capacity to double. We're willing to take on the challenge of this. We've been equipped to do so.  where we look around and we see that we may be one of the only willing to step up and to meet the need, but we need your help. We're willing to take on the challenge if you'd be willing to grant us the rezoning that is necessary for it. I've got with me today Spencer from the MAG group. He's over the design of this project.

Over the past three years, Mayag Group Architects has worked with the City Rescue Mission to find a way that a facility can expand the services of the City Rescue Mission to meet the growing needs that he discussed. We've spent time, energy, and money studying a multitude of options in many different capacities. Some were renovating existing building locations that they owned, some were looking at vacant properties around the city, and some were looking at just vacant lots.  And finally, 415 and 421 were determined to be a strong candidate and they meet to meet the city rescue missions needs. The existing buildings at 415 and 421 are approximately 37,000 square feet in total. And the addition that we are proposing in the designs that you see is roughly about 7,000 square feet.  The new location would increase the capacity to 300 beds and offer sheltered spaces day and night. And this would include a protected courtyard to encourage gathering within the boundary of the building's walls. It would include dining, meeting spaces, chapel spaces, and dormitories. Rezoning that we're requesting of these parcels would actually move the parcels to a more restrictive zoning typology, but would permit the city rescue mission to create a sheltered care facility and meet the needs of the on-house population.",517,594,"""""",Other,Other,0,0

That also helps us to alleviate some of in the evening on the Michigan Avenue, right there in front of the ballpark in front of the Capitol, we recognize it's probably not the way that the city wants to be presented during the rush hour times.  And so this means that there won't be lengthy lines of people waiting out in the public to be checking in because we're open all day long. People are able to already be in the facility and check in internally without entering the public fair.  For the courtyard that you mentioned, yes, we have goals of creating a courtyard space. The people are able to still be within our facility proper as far as they're still checked into our facility. They haven't left. They're not on the public walkways. They're not under the streets. They're not in the parking lot. But they're able to still be checked into our facility to be outdoors, to enjoy anything from fresh air, conversation, a chat at the picnic table, or anything else they'd like to do.  while still being contained within the property as well.",652,740,"""""",Other,Other,0,0

It looks like there were several other sites that were also selected, but they were told they were in DT3 zoning and could not be rezoned. These two parcels are both DT3 and wondering why these are eligible for rezoning, but others aren't.  Also, why we're not being told this is a spot zone, regardless of the fact that it says, unlike most zoning districts, the RAR district is only intended to address very specific locations, so you would not find other surrounding zoning districts to report with it.

So when you walk by, check it out. It was beautiful. Councilman Brown was there as well.  I want to congratulate all of our seniors that were recognized as part of the RSVP Seniors Program. And congratulations to, not Council President, to Carol Wood, who is the Executive Director. But that was a great, a great evening. And people were very appreciative of the recognition. Our seniors do a lot for our city. I was excited to be part of the Play Michigan Accessibility Park Grand Opening.  So if you haven't been there, please check out our newest accessibility park, which is available to all of those with disability. It's in Adado Park up at Shiawassee and Grand, parking for able-bodied folks on the street and the ramp. And then we've got a parking lot for those with disability needs. And I think this is the first parking lot all for those with disability needs. But watching those kids play, it was a sight to see. So I hope everyone will check that out.  I also want to congratulate all of the individuals that were inducted into the Everett High School Sports Hall of Fame, which was also a fun evening. The national championship basketball team, Irvin Johnson,  a variety of others. It was a lot of fun. Coach Hutchins, who of course is the winningest softball coach, it was a lot of fun. So congratulations to all those folks. We got lots of fun things coming up. On Wednesday, our Child and Family Charities will have a new groundbreaking, which will be exciting. This Thursday, for all the city employees out there,  Employee Appreciation Day, so we'll be celebrating our city employees. Friday, our Mikey 23 Foundation has their annual gala where they are honoring U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow. Saturday, there's going to be a whole display of Hispanic culture in Old Town, or no, in Rio Town, in Rio Town.

LS_09_18_23,SPEAKER_23,"Hello, I'm Erica again. And I've said a couple times that I'm the founder of an organization that's addressing homelessness. And that's primarily because I have lived experience of being homeless in Lansing. And before I became homeless, I was actually a homeowner. And I kind of knew what kind of support I need, but it was not accessible in our community. And that's  a big part of the reason why I started an organization. The first place that I was able to find the support that I needed was the City Rescue Mission of Lansing.  You can look at their Maplewood location and see that the city rescue mission is not a hotel, but it's a great neighbor in that neighborhood. I would like to address some of your concerns about their doctrinal statement. I'm a believer. I recognize that not everyone is, so maybe that might not be appealing to them. But I would like for us as a community to think about, I'm not going to say this as a factual statement, but I do believe that all of our homeless  Shelters in Lansing are started by Christians in our faith-based organizations And I think that actually says a lot about Christians and there's you know, we can complain about them But I just would like to put it out into the world that you know, the space is wide open for anyone else to  start a shelter where they want to perpetuate their own values. While I was at the city rescue mission, I saw a lesbian couple that lived there or were residing there as a guest, and they were treated well and had a good time. You know, like nobody loves being in a shelter, but they were treated well. You know, they had smiles on their face. I talked to them every day. They were not like, oh my gosh, we're being,  discriminated against here. There's another narrative going around that the City Rescue Mission sends young boys to the men's shelter. I actually have a client that is residing as a guest at the City Rescue Mission right now, and she has a son that is over their age, and they've definitely made whatever, you know, exceptions are necessary for him to stay there with his family and not go to  the men's mission on his own. So I think the last thing that I want to say is like as a single parent staying at that Maplewood location, it's kind of a different vibe between the families and the single women. And so I think that it would be great for the city rescue mission to separate those out and have that Maplewood facility be just for families.  And, you know, we can all have our own personal beliefs, but it's not gonna be possible to not recognize the success that the City Rescue Mission has had in our community.

In reference to agenda items three and four, the rezoning from D23 urban core to RA residential adaptive use, reuse district and the special land use permit for the requested as an authorized shelter care facility. The city of Lansing continues to have several people who are unsheltered and need housing and care from the city rescue mission.  As a volunteer for this ministry organization, I've witnessed the need for expansion of its facilities. This ministry is a key provider of care for vulnerable and needy population in our community, as well any rescue mission throughout the United States faces these needs. The city of Lansing does not have a cost related to the city rescue mission. There is a potential for costs  for the city if other programs are developed and started by the city to address the unsheltered in Lansing. So it is a wise choice to permit expansion of the city rescue mission facilities. Approving and rezoning a special land use permit is a win for everyone. On a second item in reference to item five, determination of the cabaret license revocation for energy event center.  that is located in the Logan Square area. I'm in favor of voting for revocation. After reviewing the minutes from a recent committee of the whole about the event held on July 30th, the event was not properly staffed, wasn't coordinated with the city support or monitored. Therefore, the holder of the license should not be allowed to host a future event. The potential for a future event hosted by this licensee,  could be a negative risk for residents based on poor management of the past event and the violence that occurred is clear from what the materials I read. Again, I urge you to revoke the current cabaret license. Thank you.",3192,3318,"""""",Public Hearing,Commenter,0,1

I do have a few questions that are directed, I guess, more to them to answer at the next round of public hearings or whatever, but just to get them out there.  I've been a supporter for a long time of the rescue mission and I know they've been raising funds for some time to expand the East Michigan Avenue location. So the questions I have are what happens to that money? Does that money go then to this new venture? And what happens to the existing facilities? We've heard what would happen with Maplewood and I think that's a good move. What happens with the men's facility on East Michigan? What happens with the outreach facility?  And then lastly, I'm somewhat concerned that some of this is being driven not just by the need of the population they serve,  but by the optics that was mentioned by them of having homeless lined up on the streets, of having people in the doorways near the new city market, near the lug nuts, near the hotel, et cetera. Are they being pressured out of their location by the forces that be that don't want those people, if you will call them in those terms, visible from their,  upscale new locations. Some of the wording in their cover letter was that zoning changes were part of the pressure for them to move. Is form-based zoning part of that?  And it says also that the continued concerns regarding revitalizing downtown have limited their options, which is part of what leads me to think that they are being pressured out of their existing location by the fact that the other businesses and city administrators perhaps don't like to see homeless in front of the city market or the Lugnut Stadium or wherever.

LS_09_18_23,SPEAKER_22,"Good evening. I think I've gotten to know some of you very well, others just recently. My name is Susan Cancro. I'm the executive director at Advent House Ministries. I'm in my 30th year of service in that position.  And I just want to say two things initially. Homelessness, the degree of homelessness in our community is the worst that I've ever seen it in 30 years. And the second thing is that I have not had that experience myself, but what it does to people  is it can be dehumanizing. And that's not to say that people who are homeless are not human at all. But when one doesn't have a place to eat, a place to get a glass of water, a place to be warm, or a place to cool off, a place to lay down, one does not feel fully human.  What we've done ourselves at Advent House Ministries, and what we've done in partnership with other agencies, including the City Rescue Mission, with which we work very closely, is we try to bridge the gap between the crisis of homelessness and the assuredness of a stable life.  I would ask everyone here, and we've spoken, and sometimes as we defend our own positions, we can be divisive. We don't need division right now. We've got a crisis. We have a big problem. The reason it's not seen is because so many in the community are helping. The shelters are putting people up. They're finding places.  HRCS department has been very supportive. And I know they come under criticism because they're on the front line. And development and planning has been very supportive. I just want to say that in support of those people I've worked with all these years, please, we do not need to argue or divide among ourselves. We need to work together. Lansing is not LA.  It's not San Francisco or Anchorage that's been in the news recently. I grew up in New York City. I love New York, but I wouldn't want to do what I'm doing there. OK, this is tough times. We need to help people. And I know Don Morrison, we worked together. Remember Don?  He remembers. I don't know if that was good or bad. That's the buzzer. I got to stop. Anyway, I know it's not easy.

To start off, I'd like to, I understand concerns of residents of the area of the new shelter being planned there, but I'd like to point out that with the shelter on Michigan Avenue,  In the past 10 years, kitty corner to the existing shelter has been the stadium apartments across the street from the existing shelter has been the six block 600 apartments. And currently there are two apartments under construction down the road on large across the street from Holy cross. So clearly.  there's already existing precedence of shelters being, not only being near residential areas, but residential areas growing around shelters. So I have no, I don't see that as a concern of a shelter being near existing people. I've actually spoken a lot with individual homeless people and many, so, so, so many of them are actually very recent, like post pandemic homeless who used to have homes.  I can't, I'm not a psychologist, so I can't entirely speak on this, but it seems to me that having a shelter within a community area has got to be a huge, huge boost to these individuals to be back in a more familiar environment that they used to be proud to be in. Now, forgetting, actually just forgetting about the shelter aspect of it and looking purely objectively at the rezone,  The zoning type we're talking about is residential adaptive reuse. I heard a council member mention that that's for things like hospitals, which is actually, I'm going to disagree with that is not for hospitals.  If you look through the city of Lansing, there's no hospitals that are zoned as that. It's for former institutional sites with the concerns for spot zoning. If you look at the residential adaptive reuse zone through the city, it is almost always a spot zone because that is by nature, it is a spot zone type. It is a zone that is put on a former location.  The zone has to go where formal locations end up popping up. That could be anywhere. And if we're talking about the actual requirements of this zone, I actually have, I've read through all 201 pages of the zoning code because  That's what I do on a Friday night. If we read through the actual zoning code for RAR, the purpose and intent of the RAR district is to promote the appropriate reuse or redevelopment of former institutional sites.

LS_09_18_23,SPEAKER_25,"Good evening, Farhan Omar. I'm here to talk about item number five, and why we should not revoke the license for Energy Event Center. The truth of the matter is, before this business even opened its doors, we've had shootings in this city. We've had gun violence issue in this city. Even after the July 30th shooting, there has been many shootings after that.  We have over five people that have died in this city since that shooting. And so I'm just confused where you guys are getting all this energy from to address gun violence when all these years you guys have not addressed the gun violence in this city. Just last year, over 20 people died. The year before that, over 20 people died. We've had 300 shootings in this city just this year alone. So are you guys picking and choosing what lives are  What lives matter in this city? Because I'm just confused. This is not a business issue. Whether you revoke this license, the gun violence doesn't end. And anybody who thinks that by closing the doors of this business, it is somehow going to end the gun violence in the city is highly mistaken. We all know that. So let's stop playing games.  We have over 100 unsolved homicide cases in the city. Unsolved. Mothers are still seeking justice for their children. And you guys are busy worried about a business? Yes, I get it. It was very tragic. Very tragic. But before that shooting happened, this business only hosted two events. Two. It's a new business. It's growing. Work with it.  Work with it. Don't shut it. Because we've had shootings in front of businesses in this city. Tin Can? Shootings. Behind Impression 5? Shootings. Omar's, the strip club? Shootings. In front of the Lugnut Center? Shootings. So if we're going to play by this new rule that the city is going to enforce every 1,500 feet, then I guarantee you the next shooting that takes place in front of a business, I'm going to come here and say we shut it down. And then we won't have any businesses in this city.  So think about that. You guys are setting a new precedent when you guys decide to vote to shut this business down. It's not going to end the gun violence in the city. We have a lack of vision, a lack of strategy from our police department and from our mayor. That's why the gun violence hasn't ended in the city. So come on. Who are you guys playing? What are you guys exactly playing?  It doesn't end the gun violence in the city. This is a racially motivated case against a black-owned business. It's just that simple. And it's not that far-fetched because Andy Schor in this city was convicted in a federal court for creating a hostile work environment based on race.

I want to say that I strongly support the consideration of rezoning for the purposes that City Rescue Mission has outlined. We absolutely don't all agree among those of us that serve the homeless community here in the Lansing area.  We don't agree on everything, on how to serve, on the policies that we should have for our organizations. For example, Haven House is a secular organization. We're an emergency shelter for families. We also provide housing services. But we work in collaboration with other agencies like City Rescue Mission, often that have very different motivating mission statements and operating procedures. And the reason is because we all have one common purpose in mind, which is providing shelter for people when they need it,  And more importantly, really helping those folks quickly find housing.  I know that we've seen City Rescue Mission take great strides over the years to lower their barriers to entry. And so I think that when it comes to what's available to us now, absolutely City Rescue Mission has filled the space. They've stepped up, they've provided really quality services and some services that none of the rest of us are providing. When it's the middle of the night and none of the other shelters can take someone, City Rescue Mission takes them.  And that's regardless of faith or gender or other types of identity. So Haven House is the lead agency for the Homeless Management Information System. That means we have a lot of access to data about homelessness. I also serve as the chair of the Strategic Planning Committee for the Capital Region Housing Collaborative. That is the body that serves as the continuum of care for Ingham County.  If you have any questions about why an independent thinker would support this rezoning, please give me a call or shoot me an email. I'd be happy to inform you more about these issues. But just as a snapshot, if we look back in January of this year, some of the agencies represented here today were doing that street outreach, counting folks who were homeless. And yeah, there were more than 50 unsheltered people homeless on that given night.  But there was more than 600 homeless individuals in the Lansing area, and mostly in Lansing, that were sheltered on that night, because most of our homeless population here is sheltered. And even though Haven House and Loaves and Fishes and Holy Cross emergency shelters are providing some of those overnight services, and others like Avon House are providing crucial services, grassroots organizations are helping too, moms and dads are helping too, our whole community is pulling together for this, right?  But City Rescue Mission is the one that's providing shelter for the majority of those individuals on any given night in Lansing. So really, this is a no-brainer. Yes, other locations were considered. And yes, there are some pros and cons to the current location, but it really is the decision that has to be made now for the community.",4069,4251,"""""",Public Hearing,Commenter,0,1

Most people have an image in their head of homeless people as dirty or negative or bad or et cetera. Unfortunately, I was one of those people with the misconception until life happened and I became homeless myself. I got to know a lot of people in the homeless community. I learned that these people are people too and most of them just need help. This mindset, unfortunately, can push people further into the struggle  Being homeless, I judged myself a lot based on how people would see me, and it didn't help me out of homelessness, but pushed me further into it. When I was a guest at the City Rescue Mission, sorry, don't speak well publicly, I remember walking in the door and seeing a smiling face every day, and somebody to remember my name made me feel special and made it a happier time in my life. They set me up with counseling and healthcare and resources to get sober.  It was a safe place to come and have my needs met. This experience in my life brought me purpose and brought me here in front of you today to speak as a staff member of the City Rescue Mission of Lansing. A lot of people are struggling now and the homeless community is rising with the cost of living and a lot of people just need help to get back on their feet. They are regular people just like you and me. Many of them are misunderstood. There are a lot of misconceptions about homeless people. As an employee, I know  that we do our best to help people and get them to a better place in their life and present them with resources to get them healthy and stable financially, mentally, spiritually, and physically. We are limited in space. We have an overflow of people that we cannot help because we simply do not have a bed available some nights, and it is very unfortunate. We want to provide food, shelter, hope, and the love of Jesus to everyone we possibly can. I'm very hopeful for this expansion project.  And as for the doctrinal agreement, when I applied coming from homeless, that terrified me. So I understand, but I did sign that agreement and I was welcomed with open arms and it's a great company to work for and we do not turn away people for being transgender or gay.

That was part of the press report. And I don't think that this does that based on  the record that we had to refer to that the Energy Event Center had 10 trained security guards and that the action that got them, I guess, under scrutiny was from what happened in the parking lot, but in the license, they're required to  basically keep 1500 feet safe, which is over a quarter mile. So I guess based on what happened in the parking lot is the basis of everything here. And I, there was no warnings or anything given to Mr. Cabal in the energy center. And, um, I think that we could have handled it better. So not that the events weren't serious cause they were, I just don't think that revoking  the energy centers cabaret license is the result that we should move forward on.

I'm a member of The Nation Outside, and their nationwide push that's entitled, The Rent Is Too Damn High. And I'm telling you right now that over 600 people showed up on the lawn, first day of the legislation session, that what we need is statewide rent control.  We heard a lot of horror stories. I'm sure anybody who's ever experienced house homelessness knows what it's like and how we're all at risk of it. Lansing Housing Commission, terrible conditions that are never remediated. They sold it to a for-profit company that said that they could guarantee that there'd be so many Section 8 houses. They can't guarantee that. They're not the ones who make the decision about who gets Section 8. And even when they do,  If somebody's got a two-month lease going, they can't show up tomorrow, which is what many Section 8 landlords want. And there's not nearly enough of them, so big problems. Another problem is municipal control, because some cities just don't care how many mega-landlords they get to gouge tenants and tell them, yeah, you can move in as soon as you give us a $600 two-month deposit.  than they do, and then they're told that the rent just went up $600. You know, that's not fair, right? So I learned today where Sarah Anthony and Kara Hope stand on this issue.  They're inclined to think that municipal control is great in the Democratic-controlled cities because they're liberal and they're going to vote for things that are good. And then there's the rest of the state. And I'm here to tell you, lots of people from all over the state came. They actually rented buses to come to that event on the lawn. And there's going to be another legislative day where we try to listen to the legislators and find out why they don't understand. We've got to get rid of municipal control, and we've got to give it statewide.  and the state will handle it in a much better way than what's happening now. So when it comes to the Lansing City Council, I hope y'all will go on record to be in favor of statewide rent control. And I'll be here to check on you.

That business did not pose a colossal danger to this community that gun violence does.  We've had, what was it, 517 gun range? 60 guns were stolen from that store. 60. I am sure many of those guns are in Lansing being used. I didn't hear any of our elected officials going to their elected officials and saying, hey, let's revoke their license. Many examples that I can cite and tell you guys, many stories.  But at the end of the day, I want to see plans. You guys are the elected officials. You guys like to flex your muscles here and there.
