Okay, colleagues, we're going to move into public comment.  We will open the remote public comment period for items on the City Council agenda, introduction and referral calendar, and the Council's work program. I thank everyone for their ongoing patience and cooperation as we continue to operate this remote public comment system. It does remain our strong intent to have remote public comment regularly included on meeting agendas. However, as a reminder, the City Council reserves the right to end or eliminate these public comment periods at any point if we deem that the system is being abused or is no longer suitable for allowing our meetings to be conducted efficiently and effectively.  I'll moderate the public comment period in the following manner today. The public comment period for today was scheduled to occur for 20 minutes, with each speaker having up to two minutes to address the council. However, we do have a very large volume of individuals signed up and present to address the council today. We have approximately 70,  60, maybe 55 individuals who are with us to provide public comment this afternoon. So in the spirit of wanting to hear from as many folks as we can, I'm going to request to have the council public comment period extended. So if there is no objection, the public comment period will be extended from 20 minutes to a total of  30 minutes. Hearing no objection, the public comment period is extended to a total of 30 minutes. I will also need to reduce the amount of time allotted to each speaker, again, in the spirit of wanting to hear from as many individuals who preregistered to give public comment today within that 30-minute period. So instead of doing two minutes, I'm going to ask that the clerk provide  provide each individual with, let's see, let's do, let's start off with 60 seconds for each speaker. And again, I may need to reduce that further in order to maximize the number of folks who took the time to sign up for public comment today.  So let's go ahead and set the clock to 60 seconds. Thank you, Madam Clerk. So again, each speaker is going to have one minute to address the council.  Again, each speaker is going to be called in upon and based on the order that they registered on the council's website. Each speaker needs to call in from the phone number used for this registration and using the meeting phone number, ID, and passcode that was emailed to them upon confirmation. Please keep in mind that the number that you are calling into is different than the general meeting listen line call-in information. Each speaker will be called on in the order in which they registered on the council's website.  And each speaker is asked to begin addressing the control by reminding us of your name. You will hear a prompt of you have been unmuted, and that means it's your turn to press star six before you begin to speak. Again, once you hear the prompt of you have been unmuted, you need to press star six in order to unmute yourself. Please begin by stating your name, the item that you are addressing,  And as a reminder, your comment should relate to an item on today's agenda, the introduction referral calendar, or the council's work program. You will hear a chime at about 10 seconds. That means that you have 10 seconds left to wrap up your public comment. If you have not ended your comments at the end of the time provided, your microphone will be muted so that I can call on the next speaker.  Once you've completed your public comment, please disconnect from the line and you can follow this meeting on Seattle Channel or one of the listening options on the agenda. The public comment period is now open. Again, I'm going to call on speakers and please press star six after you hear the prompt if you have been unmuted.

Over the last year, we have seen the repeated failures of every aspect of our police accountability system. The Community Police Commission held a rare once in six years public forum in February to solicit input regarding how police complaints should be investigated and then promptly voted not to do what the community demanded. We have seen the Office of Police Accountability ignore complaints, find against victims or hand out meaningless discipline in over 99 percent of the police abuse cases from the last year.  Last week, we witnessed the latest failure of the system as the Office of the Inspector General released their first findings on the police abuse of 2020 from a 12-member panel that included seven people who are part of the failed system, including five SPD officers, four of whom have decades of questionable claims against them, including abusing protesters, and only one member who identified as a protester. It is as if the city held a peace circle for domestic violence victims and invited mostly abusers along with a few folks to represent the abused.

This trade will give Seattle Parks and Rec full control over its existing athletic field and Seattle Public Schools full control and the ability to develop its property at the elementary school.

He is the chair of the committee that has oversight of the surveillance technology related actions. And so since this is a clerk file to the surveillance ordinance, really appreciate his leadership in helping me work through some of the issues related to  A recent Office of Professional Accountability investigation where the director concluded that an officer's use of facial recognition technology was not in violation of the city's surveillance ordinance. We received analysis from central staff. The analysis shows that  The facial recognition technology is currently within the jurisdiction and purview of the surveillance ordinance, meaning that the use of the technology is currently prohibited unless reviewed and approved as described in the ordinance itself. But in order to eliminate any confusion in the future whether facial recognition technology is covered by the surveillance ordinance,  Council Central staff recommended that we use the clerk file as the mechanism for this particular clarification. We've also sort of heard differing opinions from Chief Diaz in the Seattle Police Department. Back in November of 2020, when this issue was first brought to public awareness, Chief Diaz wrote that SPD does not use Clearview AI.  and has no intention of using Clearview AI. And he went on to say, as chief, I'm committed to upholding the tenets of the surveillance ordinance and the civil liberties of our residents. Clearview AI's business product is at odd with those two central priorities. Further, on my request, again, last year, the chief sent out a department-wide communication reminding everyone  in the Seattle Police Department about the policy. It made clear that one cannot use personal technology as a means to bypass city policies and included for the review of SPD employees what the actual content of the policies were.

Her professional background includes domestic and international advocacy within local and national government, as well as program development and management with a focus on women's issues. She recently completed consulting work for Duwamish Tribal Services and has served as a founding member of student, staff, and faculty-led collective amid  Excuse me aimed at integrating an abolitionist lens to into social work practice at the University of Washington shield the master of social work from the University of Washington. As well as a master of science from the depaul university school of public service and she was born and raised in the little town of brewster Washington and currently resides in the central district of Seattle.  Our next appointment to consider for the Seattle Women's Commission is the appointment of Vinati Mamadali. Again, this appointee has lived in Seattle since 1987, currently employed at Gates Foundation since 2003. Before that, Vinati worked part-time in the Seattle Public Schools and in the King County Department of Finance, Financial Management Division.  Currently has a bachelor's degree in arts from Osama University and has a nonprofit management certification from the University of Washington and is very excited about serving our local community in this role. And I think there's one more appointment for the council to consider. Let me pull that one up for the record.  Okay, two more. The next one is Ophelia Parker. Ophelia Parker has been a resident of both Capitol Hill and the Central District. She works full-time as a legal project coordinator for Bristol-Myers Squibb's Cell Therapy Team and supports a team of attorneys on projects related to cell therapy drugs and focuses her work around patient advocacy and efficacy.  Also currently enrolled at the University of Washington where they are studying for certification in project management while they prepare for the master's degree. Also very excited about serving on the Seattle Women's Commission. And then our last appointee for consideration on the Seattle Women's Commission is Jemma K. Turk. And Jemma.  is Gemma has, for the last 10 years, worked diligently to expand abortion training and success. She hopes to use her professional expertise in program evaluation and planning and her personal commitment to women's issues to connect more profoundly with her community. She believes she can be of great service and pledges to be a committed and active member of the commission.  Her family recently moved to Seattle, but she has already found a deep affection and love for our city and is looking forward to continuing to work on issues that impact women, highlights in particular. Her concerns about the number of women who have left the workforce due to COVID and wanting to play a role in shepherding the city's policies towards reintegrating those women into our workforce.  So colleagues, those are our appointees for consideration on the Seattle Women's Commission. Are there any additional comments?

As I am not a member of the Transportation Committee, today has been my first opportunity to  engage in a council process on this bill, I do want to thank Councilmember Peterson for providing space to meet and discuss potential concerns with him in the run-up to his process in his committee and do appreciate that that process was inclusive of my positions as the councilmember representing Uptown.  I do feel like I should make a statement on the legislation now that it's facing final passage and I have the first opportunity to weigh in with an official vote on it. I do support the legislation. I do think it's important that we have a strategy around the finite on-street parking supply in the uptown neighborhood and how the coming significantly large events  at the Climate Pledge Arena are going to impact that parking supply. I do just want to put on the record for folks watching, and this will probably be redundant to the discourse in the Transportation Committee, but for the first hour of parking, for the first, rather, two hours of parking, the rate will be assessed at $3 an hour. For the second two-hour period of parking, it'll be assessed at $8 an hour, with the director discretion to increase to $12 an hour.  For a four-hour period, folks could end up paying as much as $22 for on-street parking or up to $30 if the full discretion afforded to the director is permitted. I think it is important to acknowledge that the Uptown neighborhood has considerable additional demands as a neighborhood with a number of small businesses with additional arts and entertainment  facilities in the region, all of which are going to be competing for limited parking supply with these significant events. I do want to just go on the record and state that I think it is important that when we are planning moving several thousand people into a discreet area that we do provide incentives to take advantage of the multitude of direct bus routes that go to the Seattle Center campus from all over the city of Seattle.  that we take advantage of the souped up monorail transfer that is going to be available to visitors on game days to transfer from the light rail at Westlake to the monorail in order to get to the Seattle Center campus.  And we can't forget the upcoming Thomas Street improvements that this council has supported for a number of years to increase bike and pedestrian options and indeed to facilitate potential parking from further afield and provide a good pedestrian promenade to the Seattle Center campus. All improvements in anticipating moving significant numbers of people to the Seattle Center.  There are considerable alternatives to driving, and if folks do drive, we need to make sure that we are doing our due diligence to make sure that the parking is being rationed in a way that can coexist with some of the other demands the Uptown neighborhood faces for street parking, and also make sure that we are incentivizing those other methods of folks to get to the center campus without depending on single occupancy vehicles.  So with that, I will be voting for this. I do think that considering, again, that it's only limited to situations when there are large events, these are not new default 24 hour a day parking rates for the uptown neighborhood, that this is a reasonable course of action by the department and I will be voting for it today.", "start": 6406, "end": 6638, "Transition": "\"\"", "Meeting Section": "Other", "Speaker Role": "Other", "is_public_comment": 0, "is_public_hearing": 0, "is_comment_start_trigger": 0, "is_comment_end_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_start_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_end_trigger": 0}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_27", "text": "Thank you so much, Council Member Lewis.

The introduction and referral calendar is adopted as amended. If there is no objection, the agenda will be adopted.  Hearing no objection, the agenda is adopted. So we'll move right into public comment. Colleagues, at this time, we will open the remote public comment period for items on the city council agenda, introduction and referral calendar, and the council's work program. Thank everyone for their ongoing patience and cooperation as we continue to operate this remote public comment system. It remains the strong intent of the city council to have remote public comment regularly included on meeting agendas. However, as a reminder, the city council reserves the right to end or eliminate these public comment periods at any point  If we deem that this system is being abused or is no longer suitable for allowing our meetings to be conducted efficiently and effectively. I'll moderate the public comment period in the following manner. Public comment period for this meeting was scheduled to be 20 minutes with each speaker having up to 20 minutes to speak. As many of you heard our IT folks say before we formally started streaming this meeting, we have over 50 people signed up for public comment today.  So in an effort to hear from as many if not all of those individuals who signed up for public comment, I'm going to extend the public comment period but shorten the amount of time provided to each person from two minutes to a total of one minute per speaker. This should allow us to hear from just about everyone who preregistered for public comment this afternoon. So if there's no objection, the public comment period will be extended from 20 minutes to 60 minutes in total. Hearing no objection, the public comment period is extended to a total of 60 minutes.  I'll call on speakers in the order in which they preregistered to provide public comment on the council's website. Speakers must call in from the phone number used for this registration and using the meeting phone number, ID, and passcode that was emailed to them upon confirmation. This is different than the general meeting listen line call-in information. Once I call a speaker's name, staff will unmute your microphone. You will hear an automatic prompt of you have been unmuted, and that will be the speaker's cue to press star six before speaking.  Please begin by stating your name and the item that you are addressing on today's agenda. The introduction referral calendar, excuse me, on today's agenda, the introduction referral calendar or the council's work program. Speakers, you will hear a chime when 10 seconds are left of your allotted time. Once you hear the chime, please begin to wrap up your public comment. If you do not end your comments at the end of the one minute you've been allotted, your microphone will be muted to allow us to call on the next speaker.  Once you've completed your public comment, please disconnect from the line, and if you plan to continue following this meeting, you can do so via Seattle channel or the listening options listed on the agenda. The public comment period is now open, and we will begin with the first speaker on the list. Again, once I call your name, you are gonna hear a prompt of you have been unmuted. After you hear that prompt, press star six so we can hear you.

There is a direct connection between our current housing and homelessness crisis and the racist displacement policies that the City of Seattle enacted in the 60s and 70s.  Black families and homeowners were uprooted from their central district community, displaced, and redlined out of stability and prosperity under the guise of urban renewal, all at the hands of the city of Seattle. Homelessness disproportionately impacts communities of color precisely because of intentional racist policies like these, which are commonplace all across the country. The impacts of these policies continue to reverberate and have robbed generations of our Black neighbors of stability, prosperity, and community. We need council to go beyond platitudes and progressive rhetoric  Housing justice is racial justice, and addressing our housing crisis begins with acknowledging the shameful history and investing immediately in the communities directly impacted by it.

Though such a program as SPD's regular exchange of training with Israeli defense forces will forever be an ugly, blackened scar on our history, this bill offers us the opportunity to move forward on our journey to creating an anti-racist society.  Israel has a long and well-documented history of egregious human rights abuses, persecution of non-white ethnic groups, and brutal nationalistic violence. Make no mistake, it is first and foremost a colonialist state and a legal state.

Having myself spent multiple days in a row at Harborview Hospital, I can tell you that it was made easier because my family lives in the city. We are a regional hospital, and having more extended stay opportunities across the street is going to be really  a benefit for our entire region. This legislation does enable that development by allowing for the removal of two trees while increasing protections for other trees in the Yesler Terrace property. After working with the Seattle Housing Authority and touring the site, I successfully proposed an amendment to the legislation to increase the replacement requirement for the removed trees from a one to one replacement to a three to one replacement.  Also appreciative of Councilmember Peterson bringing forward an amendment to put parameters around where replacement trees can be planted to ensure we get the most public benefit for the benefit of the Seattle Housing Authority residents.

Two amendments are added to the docket by this resolution. An amendment from Councilmember Lewis to remove an arterial street designation from West Florentia Street between 3rd Avenue and North Queen Anne. For background and reference, we cannot put traffic calming measures on arterial streets, and if anyone's driven on West Florentia, we know that this Street A needs  traffic calming and it's a very narrow street. We also have an amendment from myself that would add language to the comprehensive plan to encourage the putting on lids on freeways  to reconnect communities and create new open space and buildable land. There are six other amendments proposed and were deemed as not meeting the criteria for docketing. One of these is James Gracie, you did call in and spoke up about your project, a project that I think has great merit  Unfortunately, the comprehensive plan is not the correct vehicle for your rezone since it is a single property. The proper rezone process for one piece of property is the contract rezone process. This resolution that we are considering today is separate from the annual comprehensive plan amendment process, which we will be taking up in September. So for reference, we set this resolution for what we will consider  in September of 2022. What we are taking up in September of this year in 2021 was taken up a year ago by resolution in August, July of 2020. So instead these docketed proposals will be studied in the months to come and again considered in the 2022 round of amendments.

Moving forward is a longstanding request from  some members of the South Park community about the South Park status as an urban village and the request for a report to council as described in some resolutions associated with MHA from a couple years ago.  So I really appreciate that this amendment was included. I also want to speak to the fact that I'm pleased that the amendment related to impact fees is included. And then lastly, well, there's actually two more points. As it relates to a transportation element that hasn't moved forward because I think it's  It wasn't considered because it was a repeat amendment, and that is specifically the amendment in the transportation element of the comp plan to minimize damage from heavy vehicles. Just want to note that this is really an ongoing issue as it relates to the condition of the streets, specifically around areas where we have increased  the use of transit and also in areas where other types of large vehicles, great vehicles are using the streets, just calling out the streets around Westwood Village, as well as many in South Park. And so just wanna flag my interest in finding some way to work on this issue moving forward.  And then lastly, Councilmember Strauss, thank you for uplifting the request to not move forward regarding an amendment for a proposed housing project in District 1.  I think we all agree that the vision for this property aligns with many other city goals related to neighborhood access, building community wealth, and combating displacement. I know OPCD has stated that they are interested in working collaboratively with the property owner to identify other potential options for the site. And as Councilmember Strauss mentioned,  A contract rezone is one approach. Another approach that OPCD has identified is the recent legislation passed that allows for affordable housing on religious property. The proponents of this ComPlan amendment have expressed an interest in building housing that is affordable to under 50% AMI. And OPCD states that under  the property zoning legislation, the current zoning potentially would allow for 30 affordable housing units. And conceivably, this is a more expedient path forward since this Council Bill 120081 has already been passed. Conceivably, this might be a more expedient approach to meeting these goals rather than a comp plan amendment.  So I'm looking forward to discussing the efforts and how to move them forward with the project components.

The committee then recorded it out with  No votes in opposition. And I believe seven, eight or seven votes in favor. You know, just to speak to it very briefly, this  Bill before us will create a dedicated city funds to accept private contributions per approval from the Seattle City Council, the same way we approve all external grants and contributions of money to the to the municipal coffers in order to engage in.  Homelessness shelter and services projects. There are a number of stakeholders out there interested in figuring out ways to expedite efforts that the council has, in many cases, already funded, but ways that the impact could be stretched even further by taking advantage of  offers from potential partners. As I've said many, many times in discussing this bill, private philanthropy is never going to replace concerted government action to solve the big problems that face our society, including the state of emergency on homelessness. But when folks do step forward to serve, it can make a discernible difference. And we should, as a city, carve out some space to engage in those partnerships when possible.
