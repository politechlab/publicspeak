Whereas Mr. Robert White has been the longest-serving commissioner in the Historic District Commission in his 50 years of existence and the longest-serving member on the Board of Review. Now, therefore, I, Christopher Taylor, Mayor of Ann Arbor, Michigan, do hereby recognize and thank Robert White for his contributions and dedicated service to the City of Ann Arbor and proclaim June 5, 2023, as a day to honor him at the conclusion of his service to the City of Ann Arbor, I should add, at least in these capacities.", "start": 345.228, "end": 488.705, "Transition": "\"\"", "Meeting Section": "Other", "Speaker Role": "Other", "is_public_comment": 0, "is_public_hearing": 0, "is_comment_start_trigger": 0, "is_comment_end_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_start_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_end_trigger": 0}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_05", "text": "So, Mr. White.

The.  ICPOC subcommittees continue to work. We have decided to forego our July and August meetings so we can enjoy some vacation time, but the subcommittees will continue to work. We have subcommittees looking at the policies and procedures for the police department to see if we need to tweak any of those, as well as getting our own policies and procedures in order.  We are specifically working to streamline the process of reviewing complaints. And we do plan to have our year-end report in by the end of 2023. Now,  As you know, part of our mission is to increase transparency and accountability in order to bring about better relationships between the police department and the Ann Arbor community. And I'm sure you also know that the Southeast, I want to make sure I get all the names right, the Southeast Michigan Criminal Justice Policy Research Project, known as SMART, that was the acronym for SMART, has been underway. The research has been going on for a little more than a year.  and that's been done at Eastern Michigan University. They've been conducting an analysis of traffic stops collected by the Ann Arbor Police Department for the period of time from January 2017 through December 31st, 2019.  The study was funded in large part through the Community Policing Innovations Initiative, a program of the Community Foundation of Southeast Michigan. The goal of the analysis was to identify any potential evidence of racial disparities that may be present with regard to police traffic stops.  And I am reporting today that that draft, I think I mentioned it a couple of months ago and we expected it to be out. The draft report is out. We have our copy. I think some of you members of council have received a copy of that report. If not, I spoke with Dr. Karpiak who's in charge of that study and it is forthcoming. But what I'd like to let you know  is that the analysis identified significant disparities across every dimension that they examined, with non-white motorists being stopped and searched more frequently across every dimension examined.  and white motorists being stopped and searched less frequently than would be expected in every instance. The largest disparity identified in the analysis involves African American male drivers for stops initiated for equipment violations, which occurred 2.4 times more likely than would have been expected.  In addition to the stops, searches after the initial stop occurred between 4 point, I'm sorry, 5.4 and 3.6 times more often with African American males. I think this is important. I know, we all have seen what negative interactions can occur as a result of a traffic stop. And I know that  This is important information. I'm aware of certain things that will be coming before this council, and I hope that you will consider this report when you look at things that I know are coming. We will be meeting, IPOC is going to be meeting with Dr. Karpiak, and we're going to talk to him about what they did, what they looked at, how they did the study. In the next two or three weeks, we expect that the commissioners will have met with Dr. Karpiak.  And we are planning a forum at our September meeting, which will be the fourth Tuesday in September. I think the date's the 24th. We will be inviting the public. We certainly are inviting any council members who wish to attend. And we're going to be discussing the report, which will be out in the public by that time.  That is what's new with us. If there are any questions, I'm happy to address them.

I live at 2340 Georgetown, and I am the current president of the Orchard Hills Maplewood Homeowners Association, a neighborhood bordering the Plymouth Road corridor.  I agree there is value in public transportation along major corridors. I understand that public transportation must be subsidized. I would support transportation nodes with mixed use if paired with a better transit system. I might support increasing density along corridors with existing transportation.  If the regulations were written to respect certain characteristics of those corridors, which TC1 does not do. I don't think one size fits all. Plymouth Road is not at all like State and Eisenhower, which had no natural features and no residential neighbors. Plymouth Corridor residents already live in a 15 to 20 minute walkable neighborhood. I think significant natural features, trees, wetlands, creek sheds like the Miller Creek are too valuable to our health  and well-being to be replaced. Traffic and pedestrian safety is vitally important, yet there's no plan to address this yet. Heights of TC1 buildings should not shade the backyards of adjacent residential lots.  I know Council has a vision for the future, but most Ann Arborites don't know that yet. I expect that could change during the public engagement portion of the rewrite of the comprehensive plan. What I don't understand is what made this resolution necessary. What is the urgency of this? What steps are considered extraneous? Does this mean you want to rezone these two corridors without any further public engagement?  What is the reason for outlawing any improvements in the ordinance before passing more mass zonings with what we know is a flawed ordinance? This resolution seems urgent, vague, and perhaps misleading. It sends a message that seems to say  We need to pass this before the comprehensive plan gets going and the public have a chance to alter it. Something is wrong here. I don't expect Council to always agree with me or any other resident. However, I respect, I expect respect, an opportunity for dialogue and an effective effort for addressing residents' concerns.  This resolution signals not caring to know what the public thinks because you have a vision and you fear it might fail if you inform the public.

A bond issued by the EDC is not a bond issued by the  By the city and vice versa. It's important to keep that distinction in mind The EDC is a is a way to for a eligible applicant for an eligible project to save Substantial sums on their financing costs. So it's it's been it's benefited many projects in the city over the years but as a bond issuing entity  it's required to comply with the requirements of both state and federal law.  Federal law is governing tax exempt obligations like EDC bonds. It's probably one of the, if not the, one of the most complex in the tax code. Arbitrage regulations and so forth. So that it's important that as a project goes forward that everything that can be done is being done to facilitate that process. One of the reasons, one of the,  underlying the MOU besides the ones that Professor Thompson mentioned, was to make very clear the paramount necessity that these bonds, no matter what these new enterprises are going to be, the new services and roles that the EDC may play for the city,  that underline all of it, there has to be compliance with these laws. So for that technical reason, that's, again, the other reason. The other, as she pointed out, was the tremendous opportunities for the city and the staff and  the board of the EDC to explore what these new roles and services may be. It's literally unlimited. So it should be exciting to see. So I, by all means, please regard the EDC as a partner and an entity looking very much forward to working with council and staff. I'll be here.

My name is Emily Skrogi and I'm an Ann Arbor resident. I'm here today to express support for the proposed humane pet store ordinance, especially prohibiting the potential future sale of dogs in pet stores. Puppy selling pet stores are a part of a greater pipeline which funnels sick and inhumanely bred puppies into the hands of consumers. The system completely lacks transparency and puppy purchasers don't know what cruelty they are supporting, which is puppy mills.  or commercial breeding facilities with recorded animal welfare violations and hundreds of dogs confined to small cages for the entirety of their lives. Pet stores often sell their puppies for thousands of dollars with false promises of humane, regulated sourcing and healthy, socialized puppies when this is very rarely true.  This ordinance would protect our community members from misleading sales tactics, sick puppy sales, high veterinary bills, and predatory lending that so often occurs when customers can't outright afford a puppy.  The reality is no pet store needs to sell animals in order to be successful. According to Pet Business Magazine, of the top 25 pet retailers in North America, only one sells puppies. And in 2022, that chain shrunk while competitors that didn't sell dogs grew. This is evidence that no pet store needs to sell dogs to be profitable. Pet stores can thrive by providing pet owners with everything they need to care for their pets, rather than selling the pets themselves. And this model is already followed by the vast majority of pet stores here in Michigan.  Six states and over 460 localities have prohibited the sale of dogs and cats in pet stores, including East Point, Fraser, New Baltimore, Royal Oak, Harbor Springs, St. Clair Shores, and newly Woodhaven here in Michigan.  These laws have shrunk demand for puppies bred in cruel conditions with public records showing 32,000 fewer breeding dogs in USDA licensed puppy mills than 10 years ago. I hope Ann Arbor will join in this effort by passing this ordinance and keeping our community humane.

This is Tom Stolver calling from Lower Town in Ann Arbor. First, I'd like to give my regards to Bob White and his years of volunteer service. He and I served on the Historic District Commission together for six years.  As someone who's developed in multiple communities and personally rezoned properties and participated in multiple comprehensive plan revision processes and has access to advice from experts in land use law, I offer this. Zoning is law, literally. The zoning code is the codification of the comprehensive plan into enforceable legal language. A rezoning is a change in the law, literally.  So do we really want to instruct the Planning Commission to recommend to change the law for hundreds of parcels to a one-size-fits-all set of rules called TC1, without them being able to recommend to make a new TC2 if good planning would suggest a different set of rules, and without being able to tweak TC1 if it would be problematic planning to apply it as-is to multiple transit corridors, each with different characteristics?  I don't think that is a wise direction, nor do I think it meets the intent of the Michigan Zoning Enabling Act. The Michigan Zoning Enabling Act allows municipalities to have a zoning ordinance if it was based on a plan, a comprehensive plan. They go hand in hand, and the planning comes first. You make the plan, then the zoning language is the legally enforceable language to allow the plan to be executed. Yes, our comprehensive plan mentions the broad concept of transit-oriented zoning multiple times.  So transit-oriented development is consistent with the plan, but the plan lacks sufficient specificity to go straight into encoding. But that's what we're doing. An analogy would be in software development, where if you take high-level design and go straight into coding it, you end up with a mess that has to be reworked.  This proposed resolution presupposes that the Planning Commission may not determine that a new transit corridor zoning category, say TC2, be created if it would better fit the Plymouth and Washtenaw Corridors' unique characteristics. The resolution says that the TC1 set of rules must be applied. And it goes further than that. It says we must rezone hundreds of parcels to TC1 as a priority prior to making any modifications to TC1.  If TC1 doesn't fit the new corridor as well, or if we find other fixes are needed to TC1 as we learn more how applicants with properties in the first two iterations are dealing with it. We are to ignore all of that. And we must rush full steam ahead, rezoning hundreds of parcels to a flawed, one-size-fits-all set of rules. We sure are in a hurry to make amends, just prior to the comprehensive plan revision started, where there will be more public engagement  and a more robust planning process.

And I do want to express my gratitude for the recently released Community Engagement Report that was provided by Public Sector Consultants, PSCs.  I am particularly pleased to see that three key findings in the report align with Crow's values and I urge the City Council to prioritize the following. So first, funding unarmed public safety response.  from existing budget resources. And this approach really ensures that fiscal responsibility and demonstrates the city's commitment to addressing the root causes of conflict and crisis without increasing the tax burden on residents and redirecting funds from traditional law enforcement to unarmed public safety response and redirect city resources to supportive social services instead of punitive and harmful law enforcement.  This prevention rather than punishment approach to public safety can reduce the need for more costly interventions later on. The second aspect is establishing a separate number for unarmed response. And having a dedicated number for unarmed response can help streamline services, ensure appropriate response to non-emergency situations.  and alleviate the burden on the 911 system. By establishing a separate number for unarmed response, communities can ensure that mental health crises, substance abuse issues, and other nonviolent situations are addressed with the appropriate level of care and expertise. The last component is excluding police from unarmed response. And by focusing on unarmed response professionals for nonviolent situations, we can  reduce the risk of unnecessary use of force, we can enhance community trust, and encourage more effective community-based solutions. And excluding police from unarmed responses can help minimize the potential for violence or use of force. Unarmed crisis response teams comprised of mental health professionals, social workers, or community mediators, they can often handle situations  without resorting to forceful tactics. So I kind of request that the city council take these findings into consideration and move forward with releasing the RFC for unarmed response.

I'm calling in support of the coalition for re-envisioning our safety, also known as CROWS. I have read the community engagement report by public sector consultants and I'm here to urge the city council to prioritize the following three key findings in that report. Firstly,  to fund the unarmed public safety response from existing budget resources. Personally, I believe that some or all of this funding should be taken out of the existing policing budget. The city's commitment of ARPA funds to an unarmed response program is a great start, and ongoing, sustained funding from the existing police budget would be a great way to ensure this program remains robust, care-based, and accessible to all Ann Arbor residents. To me, this would demonstrate the city's commitment to addressing the root causes of conflict and crisis.  Secondly, the RFP should require the establishment of a separate number for unarmed response. A dedicated number for unarmed response can help streamline services, ensure appropriate response to non-emergency situations, and alleviate the burden on the 911 system. Third and finally, the RFP should insist on the exclusion of police from the unarmed response program.  The program should focus on unarmed professionals for non-violent situations to reduce the risk of unnecessary use of force, as well as to enhance community trust and to encourage more effective community-based solutions. By ensuring a non-police response, the unarmed response program could be safely utilized by more people while simultaneously reducing the number of calls police are responding to.  Reducing the number of police responses will alleviate the burden on Ann Arbor police while freeing up existing police funds for other safety-promoting programs in the city. I kindly request that the City Council take these findings into consideration when assessing the RFP for unarmed response and moving forward with its release. Also, while I have this opportunity to speak, I would also like to extend my wishes for a happy Pride Month to all those who are being celebrated this June.  I'd like to recognize that LGBTQ plus individuals are disproportionately affected by poverty, costlessness, criminalization, and mental health crises. This means that the LGBTQ plus community would be greatly supported by this creation of an unarmed public safety response, and especially by an RFP that incorporates the three key findings that I've mentioned earlier.

It appears that historical revisionism never rests. After distributing my address to council on April 17 to a wider audience via email and Facebook, I received a reply from Diane King of Texas. She was going to disseminate my address to her email list and cautioned me against using the word Nazi, claiming it a derogatory term.  She wrote, we abhor this term. The Germans never referred to themselves that way. It's equivalent to the other ethnic slurs that are verboten, but it's okay to disparage Germans. I already knew that the term Nazi originated from a country bumpkin reference to Germans, a slur based on the common farm boy or simpleton name, Ignaz, and the shortening of that name to Nazi.  This knowledge was supplied by Benton Bradbury's book, The Myth of German Villainy. But I did not know that national socialists never referred to themselves by that name. In my ignorance, I thought everyone used the term. I asked myself whether Diane could be correct and asked the Facebook public for evidence to counter her claim.  I wanted to be shown a reference by a German National Socialist who used the term Nazi in a correspondence or speech. I ask anyone here if they have corroborative evidence of National Socialists describing themselves as Nazis.  No one on Facebook supplied such information. One respondent, though, alerted me to an article that explained exactly what Diane was claiming. The article reports that a powerful Jewish journalist named Conrad Hayden popularized this term in the 1920s as an epithet  meant to degrade members of the National Socialist Workers' Party of Germany. Apparently, this name-calling stuck. We are left with the impression that everyone used the term because we, mistakenly, are continuing to use it.  Two takeaways. One, people in groups should be referred to as they deem fit. How would our black community react to being referred to by the N word? How would our Jewish community appreciate being called the K word? I doubt either group would appreciate it. It wouldn't be right.  Second takeaway, perhaps the successful name calling technique was yet another reason why German Jews were found in disfavor by their countrymen.

More effective than having the government, more effective than having a private profit corporation when the users  manage the resources, they are better managed, more productively, and more happily. And besides just taking out that idea, they also have reduced the notion to a plaza, not a Central Park, and the entirety of the idea of a civic center is removed, a ceremonial meeting place, a visitor center for people coming to Ann Arbor.

Greetings, Mr. Mayor and Ann Arbor City Council. It's kind of hard to follow Holocaust deniers and Jew haters, but I'm going to give it a go.  On item DC2, I wanted to express my strong support in favor of this resolution, which directs the Planning Commission and staff to prioritize Plymouth and Washtenaw Avenues to be rezoned under TC1. My opinion is that this action is long overdue.  and that any further modification or revisions to TC1 zoning can take place later. I urge City Council to vote yes tonight. On item DC3, I believe, Ivan, it is telling that the Council of the Commons voted to dissolve itself during their last meeting.  as I find it indicative of the ineffectiveness and dysfunction of the COTC as a body and of the process overall. In my opinion, once the Center of the City project is put into the hands of the Parks Advisory Committee, the city should waste no more time, no more money, and put no more effort beyond  the anticipated request for proposals for a design of a quote-unquote park or quote-unquote civic commons for which the center of the city could not even come to a consensus or a definition of. And  That the city council do the right thing by putting the library lot back on the ballot with a decisive proposal that would settle once and for all. Firstly, that we get a project that can be supported.  by more than a bare majority of voters. Secondly, something precise and explicit in terms of funding for such a project, whether it be another millage or some other funding mechanism. Thirdly, that if jurisdiction is to be under- 30 seconds.  or some other explicitly defined entity. That needs to be done. And fourthly, I think city council needs to revise the city charter once again under a valid proposal to be able to once again sell the air rights  for the library lot to a developer and include provisions for affordable or workforce housing.

My name is Jean Leverage and I'm a clinical social worker who lives at 912 Pomona in Ward 5, not far from the stadium.  TC1 area, the stadium area. I currently am a clinical social worker and I serve as an at-large member of the city's Housing and Human Services Advisory Board. And I'm really just here to say three quick things because it's been  quite a tough week. And if I made something really complicated, I probably wouldn't have come to talk at all. So the first thing I want to say is I want to thank our city staff and city council for doing such good work. And I want to say, let's get moving on TC1 on the TC1 rezoning of Plymouth and Washtenaw now so that we don't keep getting these requests for single story, single use  buildings and drive-thrus, right? We don't want to have to undo stuff. Let's make it easier rather than harder to build different kinds of housing, diverse housing, to meet the needs of our economically and socially diverse community, right? Not everybody wants the same kind of house and a whole lot of people end up not living in Ann Arbor at all and then commuting in and having, you know, to add to the greenhouse gases.  Secondly, it's a really exciting agenda that you have tonight. I want to also weigh in on the cross proposal. I strongly support funding an unarmed non-police public safety response with a dedicated separate phone number and to create that from existing budget resources. And I think that that's really important because when people are in distress,  It's really great if we can have people who are trained in conflict management who are just community members to help. Thirdly, I think it's really past time to dissolve the Council of the Commons, which really was such a heartbreaking, honestly, waste of resources and time, so that we can finally  really begin to activate that parking lot that we have downtown with a public square and mixed-use buildings that have eyes on the plaza and that are bringing the public in. And that might look like affordable housing at this point. It might be affordable housing with mixed-use on the ground floor, but I really am excited that we're moving forward and I do hope that we  bring the city charter to a ballot in the very near future so that we can move forward with that. And so I just really want to thank everybody for all your hard work and just really encourage you. Let's do things now.

Happy Pride to the community. I'm so grateful to Mayor Taylor, our LGBTQ plus staff and community leaders who came tonight to celebrate Pride Month with our proclamation this evening. Last month, I attended a ceremonial bill signing with Governor Whitmer to expand the Elliott Larson Civil Rights Act. Representative Brabeck, who represents Ann Arbor, recently reintroduced legislation to ban the dangerous and discredited practice of conversion therapy.  And while here in Michigan under Democratic leadership, we have much to celebrate in support of equality and LGBTQ rights. In Republican-controlled states, LGBTQ residents are under relentless attack. More than 400 anti-LGBTQ bills have been introduced across the country already this year.  Instead of focusing on real issues like housing affordability, reducing gun violence, improving public education, expanding access to mental health support, or improving our infrastructure, Republican politicians are relentlessly attacking their LGBTQ constituents, their own neighbors, their friends and family members, and even their colleagues to score cheap political points with the most extreme hateful fringes of the right wing base. This now includes a ridiculous war on Mickey Mouse led by a future footnote in the 2024 Republican presidential primary.  Many of these discriminatory bills specifically target transgender children, including countless bills threatening to limit access to life-saving care and, through the attacks themselves, endangering their lives. These bills are dangerous, discriminatory, and seek to erase our community. Now is not the time for us to back down or to take our recent wins for granted.  And so with that in mind, I also invite our community to join in a celebration of pride or a summer of pride activities, both in celebration and in a call to activism. Locally, Pride Month kicked off in Ypsilanti on Friday and will continue through at least August 5th when Ann Arbor Pride will be celebrated on Main Street this year.  You can learn more and get involved at Ann Arbor Pride, and I also encourage you to get involved through countless community organizations like the Jim Toy Community Center, Stand With Trans, Victory Fund, the Human Rights Campaign, and so many others doing good work to support our LGBTQ community.

Did I lose it? Oh, you've got it all. Oh, I've got it. OK. You know, I don't know. I just wanted to speak to this past weekend. I attended the African-American Festival in downtown Ann Arbor. It was especially poignant, I think, because I took a second to  detour to the future side of the Catherine Street development, just walked through the park one more time, and I don't know, I thought that that was a poignant moment here. I also wanted to mention last week I attended the annual meeting of the Jewish Federation, saw a lot of Ward 2 constituents, and I also heard a speech from former Congressmember Brenda Lawrence, a black woman who represented a district  that included the highest Jewish population by percentage in the house. In her post-career, she has chosen to become president of Share the Honey, a non-profit dedicated to raising awareness of the shared history and collaboration of the black and Jewish people in America. As she said, we can't compare scars, the Jewish experience of the Holocaust and the black experience of slavery, but we can share empathy.  You know, it's a season of intersectionality in June as well, because this Pride Month, I'm thinking of the LGBTQ+, friends, classmates, teachers, priests, and colleagues old and new, whose friendship, support, and mentorship have made me into the man I am today. I knew when I ran for office that public comment is a place for community members to exercise their First Amendment rights, and all that  that has sadly come to entail in Ann Arbor specifically. But I would point out, regularly hearing Holocaust denial and hate speech in this chamber while trying to serve my community is the hardest part of this job, and I believe it actively discourages members of  any racial or religious minority from sitting in my chair and those that wish to seek the honor and privilege of representing Ann Arborites. I commend all my colleagues who have stepped up to serve in the face of this rhetoric, and I hope those watching at home, whatever background they come from, are not discouraged from one day following suit.", "start": 4252.648, "end": 4423.68, "Transition": "\"\"", "Meeting Section": "Other", "Speaker Role": "Other", "is_public_comment": 0, "is_public_hearing": 0, "is_comment_start_trigger": 0, "is_comment_end_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_start_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_end_trigger": 0}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_16", "text": "Thank you.

Kind of following up on Councilmember Watson's comments, this is also a season for bar mitzvahs and bat mitzvahs for my family. My children have been attending a number of these celebrations which begin with  a multi-generational celebration in the mornings at our local synagogues. And I've been so honored to have been able to observe this, this passing of history of suffering and honoring that continuous work in preserving the history and stories of our fellow community members. But I also should note that the families have had to engage security.  They engage security for their children's coming of age. They have to warn guests that there are protesters when they arrive from outside of Ann Arbor, and that somehow that's normal in Ann Arbor, and that somehow generations of Jewish Ann Arborites have to expect that as being normal. That's a shame. When my children celebrate their birthdays, they don't have to engage security. They don't have to warn guests that they might be harassed  I hope as we take the opportunity to celebrate months honoring different communities of color, Pride Month and Struggle, we take note that there are reasons we have to make these proclamations and invite communities to honor that work.

I just, I want to make a brief comment about false information regarding this contract that was published by a former council member.  former council member from the fourth ward, Elizabeth Nelson. Although she lost her last election fairly indecisively, she has continued to push conspiracy theories through her blog and newsletter and has worked to sow distrust in our local democratic systems. So while I would prefer not to give these rantings air, enough of my constituents see them that I feel ethically bound to correct the record.  Regarding this particular contract, she noted that the contractor's experience modification rating for the year 21-22 had changed in its most recent proposal as compared to previous ones. Now, for the uninitiated, the EMR is a metric used by insurance carriers to gauge both the past cost of a worker's compensation claims as well as the future probability of additional claim costs. It should be noted that this system is based on self-reporting.  And it is sometimes the case that the contractor's higher EMR reflects a willingness to report claims rather than actually having an unsafe working environment and vice versa. However, in this case, the former council member asserted incorrectly that an EMR for a given year can never change. And finally, she insinuated that the contractor's insurance company must have falsified the document. This is reprehensible.  It's also potentially libelous, but I'll leave that to the attorneys. What I will say is that when I noticed the change, I checked it out, and I found a perfectly reasonable explanation. The contractor had an outstanding workers' comp claim for that particular calendar year that was recently closed, and they were found to not be at fault. Therefore, their EMR for that year has now decreased.  This is very unfortunately not the first time this former council member has attacked this particular contractor. It's very curious. I'm calling on Nelson to post and send out a retraction and an apology to both Bailey Excavating and Barker Weber Insurance Agency. I do hope that readers of her blog and newsletter will take note.

Sorry. Hi, everybody. Good evening. Introduce. So we received a number of questions from council members over the last day. Before I get into addressing a lot of those questions, I want to introduce two members of the research team who are here with us tonight, Dr. Kristen Seafelt and Trevor McTowell. And we also have two members here virtually who will  we get to answering some of the questions, I'll have them introduced. But I do want to start off and talk briefly, knock out a number of the questions with some general remarks discussing the program. And I'll start by talking generally about why, who, and what. Should the council approve this contract tonight, Ann Arbor will join a nationwide community of cities that support guaranteed income and universal basic income pilots.  We wanted to do something different. As a matter of fact, when we issued our RFP for this project, we asked respondents to give us a novel approach. And there are a couple of important reasons why. This is a pilot. It's a time-limited program. It will, at some point, come to an end. And while our main objective is to provide important support to the families who will be enrolled in the program,  It was also important for us to do something of value that could be left behind to cities who want to do this again, either have a second program or start one on their own. So we wanted to have a piece of social science that was quality.  that reflected the nature of poverty in this community and potentially in other communities, and that people could use to draw on to build important lessons and do something different and push the envelope on universal basic income. And so the response that we got from Poverty Solutions met that call. And what they asked for, excuse me, what they called for,  was a pilot that wanted to examine the nature of universal basic income and how it can affect entrepreneurship, but a certain kind of entrepreneurship. And I want to get into talking a little bit about that.  This is a program that is targeted at low and moderate income households. That's the number one criteria. And among these households, people who are doing everything they can to get by, there is entrepreneurship that happens. It could be gig work or side hustles. In the household I grew up in, my mom was a stay-at-home mom, but she made wedding cakes out of our kitchen. And that was a really important source of income for our family.  And so there are communities, or excuse me, families like that all across our community in the city of Ann Arbor. And it's an important question to ask because in cities all across the country, when we see guaranteed income programs, there are always critics who step up and say giving away free money for nothing will cause people not to work.  Now on pilot and pilot across the country, I think we're able to show that that's not the case. But it's really important to understand why. And it's really important to try to find ways to design these programs in the future, so that they can produce better health and wellness outcomes for families and produce better economic outcomes for them as well.  And so we want to enroll families that are, or individuals who are from low and moderate income households who are engaged in that kind of low-level entrepreneurship. And we want to ask, what does this program do to that activity? Does it make them step it up and to do more? Does it make them say, you know what, I'm good, I'm going to take this money and invest it somewhere else?  Or does it make them say, you know what, I work hard enough as it is and I don't want to do this anymore and stop the activity entirely. And in all three of those cases, and I suspect we will find all three of those cases, does that impact their health and wellness? And how does it do that?  That's what we want to answer and that's what we want to find out through this program. So we received a lot of questions about who will be eligible. Like I said, the number one criteria is low and moderate income households. There will be an amendment offered tonight that requires those households to be City of Ann Arbor residents, members of those households to be City of Ann Arbor residents.  But that's the top line criteria. There's not a whole lot of detail other than that. And I think it's really important to understand why for that reason as well. The research and administration team working with the city will be partnering with service providers and organizations from across the city who deal with low and moderate income households and people in those households. And we will be constructing those criteria in conversation with them. Time and again,  we prove all the time that we can probably sit in City Hall and put together program criteria that meet, I don't know, 70, 80% of need, but you get over that hump to really fantastic programs by engaging people in the community and having conversations with them to understand what their needs are. So you're not gonna see really detailed eligibility and enrollment criteria within the RFP because that comes after the contract is approved and in conversation with community members.  The last thing is, what do we hope to achieve?  It's two important goals. Like I said, we want to provide support to households and families in Ann Arbor who need it, who are adversely affected by the pandemic. But we also want to leave something lasting and something that can be handed to the next city so that when they do their guaranteed income pilot, they're starting a little bit further along than we are. And with a little more clarity, and hopefully they can push the envelope on this movement a little further.  So with that being said, we have some specific questions, and I will let Dr. Seefeld introduce herself, and we'll go through and answer some of the specific questions that we received from council.", "start": 4987.008, "end": 5342.748, "Transition": "\"\"", "Meeting Section": "Other", "Speaker Role": "Other", "is_public_comment": 0, "is_public_hearing": 0, "is_comment_start_trigger": 0, "is_comment_end_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_start_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_end_trigger": 0}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "text": "Good evening council members on Mayor Taylor.

And I would stress that this really is a collaborative effort. The folks who know best are the folks who are on the front lines. And it's really very important to us that we do this collaboratively. So I really welcome all of the questions that folks might have. Just want me to run.  Sure, let's run through them. OK.

We'll work with various organizations in the community to help develop materials that really are tailored to the populations they work with, whether that is in different languages or  So just sort of pitch to what the agency itself  does.

In the addendum to the RFP, it said that we could include people in the larger community. So we responded accordingly. And in part because we had thought about, what about the folks who can't live here but who want to live here because of housing costs, or who used to live here but moved out and didn't? But that's certainly something that I understand the concern.  a grant that was made to the city of Ann Arbor, but that was sort of our rationale in that regard. We recognize, too, in regards to your question about who is our population, there really isn't a standard definition for  a micro-business, a small business, a low-level entrepreneur. And so one of the, I think, two main agenda items for our kickoff meeting once this gets launched, which will be held in collaboration with community partners who both were named in the proposal, but also others who we've talked to subsequently, is to really kind of come up with a working definition for who  who are the folks that we want to reach out to, but again, we want to do that in collaboration with the folks who know the best, and so that we're not imposing a definition that's not going to work. You'd also asked about  the sample size. So the addendum to the proposal talked about a group of 25 individuals. Those are folks who we'll do qualitative interviews with. The sample itself is 100 members who get the guaranteed income payment, 100 who serve as the control group. The addendum was just to add in an additional  And I also thank you for pointing out an error in our proposal around issues of attrition and retention. We should have said that we are assuming an 80% retention rate of those folks, not an 80% attrition rate. Yes, that would not work. So thank you for calling our attention to that.  Councilmember Watson, you'd asked about Friends Indeed who are indeed based in Ypsilanti.  They do serve the larger Washtenaw County. We don't also view them as sort of the sole source of recruitment. We don't really view any organization that we would work with as the place where we're going to recruit all of our participants. We plan to cast a wide net. And we ourselves plan to do a lot of just feet on the ground and going to events and not placing the burden entirely on the nonprofit sector to do the recruiting.  into the program. We see them as both being very helpful and being able to, you know, help us, you know, with things like providing feedback on our surveys, feedback on reports, things like this. You'd also asked about, like, well, why not just give a, you know, one-time upfront cash infusion.  We didn't want to necessarily say, because the spirit of guaranteed income really is, there aren't strings attached to what you do with the money. We didn't want to say, oh, here's some money to invest in your business. That's a slightly different model. So we're talking amongst our team. And something that we'd want to talk with the community about is, do we do  Monthly payments that are of the same amount, do we front load the payments and taper off things like that? But those are some of the design decisions that we're considering right now.  And then Council Member Harrison, you'd asked a number of questions. One about how we decided about our potential collaborators, and whether we put out a call for support. We lacked time to do that with the turnaround time in getting the proposal in. So we did a snowball approach to people suggesting us, you should talk to this group, or you should talk to this group, as well as drawing upon our own community connections.  And again, the focus of our outreach effort at that point was really to identify a population to work with, not necessarily a partner. So once we sort of landed on a population, then we selected to name Friends Indeed as our community partner because of just all the work that they do with their Circles program in this area.  You named a number of different very important organizations in the community. We have reached out or will reach out to most of them. The RFP, as we read it, specified one partner to be named. But I've been in pretty regular, almost weekly, communications with the Ann Arbor Community Foundation, for example, about bringing them into the mix.  We've talked to other organizations as well and envision continuing to do that.  You also noted in the addendum, there was a shift in the budget where the payment amount went down slightly. In consultation with the team here at the city, we decided to add an additional round of qualitative interviews to help better inform the design of the study going forward.  And but keeping the total amount of money the same. So the cost of administering the payments, and we are going to contract with a third party to send out the payments, that's fixed. And we are pretty bare bones in terms of our staff effort. And that's along with the university contributing about $170,000.  in costs as well. So we took the payments down, as you know, about $2. So that was done to really bolster the research. While we very much would love it if every person in the pilot participated in every phase of the research,  You know, that is up to the individual. We would not force anybody to complete a survey or an interview, and their payments aren't, their guaranteed income payments aren't contingent upon that. We would not disenroll anybody if they missed a survey. That's, you know, that would not be within the spirit of the program.  You'd also asked about the role that Circles and Friends, indeed, could play in helping us to locate potential participants. The Circles program really does have, as its model, the goal of helping  folks who are lower income start their own businesses and that really does resonate with what we're proposing. They've been running their Circles program that does this for about five years and they're currently in their sixth cohort.  They're definitely a group that we want to be able to tap into their network, but we also are going to collaborate with just a wide variety of stakeholders and service providers within the community, and particularly groups that, you know,  would help us locate folks who are not necessarily going to be easy for a U of M researcher to reach out to. I mean, we really are committed to developing relationships with trusted members of different communities in order to help bridge some of that gap and really to help the success of the project as a whole.  And that would include organizations that work with folks who have justice system involvement. And I appreciate that you raised that group up. For that group, certainly this kind of entrepreneurial activity is really important if folks are locked out of labor market activities otherwise. So Poverty Solutions is just starting a collaboration project with A Brighter Way.  Trevor, my colleague, is on the Housing Subcommittee of Washtenaw County Reentry Stakeholders Initiative. So we have some connections to get us started on the pilot. Another really important piece to this whole pilot is making sure that people are not worse off  for participating in it, meaning that they don't lose benefits they're receiving. So the good news is we've been in conversations with the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, and we're in the process of submitting an application for a waiver to make sure that SNAP, Medicaid, TANF, and a couple other benefit programs, that the guaranteed income payment won't count toward their eligibility for those programs.  And we're starting conversations to make sure that that would also be the case with any housing assistance folks would get. So we are trying to make sure that no one is worse off for that. And we want to also, you know,  So we'll make sure that we really have conversations about that, because that is one of the most important aspects of communication around the Guaranteed Income Project. It also could be, of course, that folks may be reluctant to come forward, not just because of fear of losing benefits, but also of tax implications or other fears about, like, is this information going to get out?  to third parties who could use it against them. So going through our institutional review board process certainly provides a layer of protection of confidentiality. We also just started talking about, and I believe we are going to go forward with securing a certificate of confidentiality from the federal government through NIH.  and that will protect the privacy of folks in the research study. It prohibits us from disclosing information about them except under a really, really limited set of circumstances. And again, we would try to convey that to participants so that they know we take their confidentiality really, really seriously. Finally, I would just say,  Thinking about, again, getting back to sort of the who and the why of this proposal that we put together. Again, we don't want to mandate that anyone use the guaranteed income payment for any particular purpose. If they want to use it toward their business, terrific. If not, that's great too. That said,  Nearly all, if not all of the other guaranteed income pilots operating throughout the nation, focus on a particular population. So I have a long list, and I can share it with you, but that includes fathers in parenting programs, female identifying care professionals, working adults, people enrolled in a community college program. So we're sort of using the low-level entrepreneur framework as a way to,  kind of select into including who's the group that will get the payment. But there's no stipulation that anyone has to keep working or on their side business in order to continue receiving the payment at all. So I sped through that really quickly. So I hope I addressed some of the questions you have. But I'm happy to answer anything further.", "start": 5557.57, "end": 6388.944, "Transition": "\"\"", "Meeting Section": "Other", "Speaker Role": "Other", "is_public_comment": 0, "is_public_hearing": 0, "is_comment_start_trigger": 0, "is_comment_end_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_start_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_end_trigger": 0}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_16", "text": "Super.

I'd like to thank Mr. Fournier and the research group at Poverty Solutions for your willingness to engage in a conversation on this, the thoughtfulness of the proposal, the continued conversations, some on quite short notice with council members here. And I do want to highlight that you've really taken time to answer a lot of my questions, and I appreciate the answers you gave.  In the second portion of my question, the one where I talked about upfront grants versus income, I think that arose from perhaps a misunderstanding of the goals of this project that were cleared up for me by some answers that were given here. And that question was basically, if we are looking to  perhaps stimulate small business in the city of Ann Arbor, minority-owned, low-income small businesses. I didn't know if that would be something that we would compare perhaps to the county's, you know, small business growth activator, which is providing $5,000 grants to, you know, low-income households with 80% that where the household income is 80% less than 80% of the  area median income in Washtenaw County, and the businesses must operate within Washtenaw County, and the businesses would have fewer than five employees. Some of these are definitions of the, you know, county definitions that you're at different points in your proposal you're using. But I just wanted to talk about the fact that it was Fournier, DCA Fournier, who  clarified that this isn't really a study about businesses or business growth or improvement. It's a study about health outcomes through a lens of people who we feel to be the most, a vulnerable population that we can target. Can you talk a little bit, Mr. Fournier and the colleagues at Poverty Solutions, could you talk a little bit about  why it's easier and cheaper to get this money out through this pilot than it would be to get it out through a universal basic income pilot where we might have to work with a private payment provider or another entity to judge eligibility and all that?", "start": 6409.867, "end": 6551.114, "Transition": "\"\"", "Meeting Section": "Other", "Speaker Role": "Other", "is_public_comment": 0, "is_public_hearing": 0, "is_comment_start_trigger": 0, "is_comment_end_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_start_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_end_trigger": 0}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_41", "text": "So a couple different ideas there I'll touch on is that when we started formulating this program, the first thing we did, we looked at the kind of programs that other cities were moving forward. And there's kind of a bumper crop of companies and nonprofit organizations that have come to fruition nationally that will administer these programs on your behalf. But many of them are very expensive.  And they'll come just right up front. They'll tell you, we take 20 to 25% up front as an administration fee. We'll enroll the people. We'll cut the checks. And when we ask follow-up questions like, well, what kind of follow-up do you do to see if these programs were beneficial and how the participants felt about it and whether we achieved outcomes? They say, oh, yeah, we do a survey. We'll email out a survey.  And the social scientists on council are all kind of laughing now because that's not really research, right? Now, they may be producing information that's useful and that's interesting for their funders or for some of their other participants, but it is not the type of information that is peer-reviewable and valuable and that can be passed on from one person to the next in a reliable way. And so when we started internally, we started thinking about, well, how do we move forward from here?  This is Ann Arbor. We have one of the finest research institutions on the planet right here. And the population of the city that corresponds with that. We have a highly educated community here, a lot of PhDs. What should we do? And we thought, the people who should be administering this are people who have a really good financial administration framework, who know how to handle federal grant funds, and who can conduct really top notch research. We thought, we need a research partner.  who can do the administration for us and also give us something of quality at the end. And that's what structured the RFP. And what we ended up getting from our friends at Poverty Solutions and the University of Michigan is a proposal that on the whole is going to cost us less money in administration and is going to give us something of  exponentially greater value.

We're trying to do something that will impact community, have a strong impact in community, and can make a statement that we've actually responded to emerging needs.  I hear from Green Baxter court residents, I hear this from the back to school celebration at Bryan Community Center, and more recently I hear this question from folks who were responding to the eviction crisis back in April when we rebudgeted money to respond to that.  We know the pandemic has impacted community members differently across race and income. We know these inequities existed before the pandemic. There was a 2018 county health study that Poverty Solutions also helped pull together where differences in social, economic, and physical environments across the county explain the differences in quality of life and health.  We know that black babies in the county are twice as likely to be born at low birth weight as white babies. We know that there are six times more likely to grow up in poverty. Hispanic children are almost three times more likely to grow up in poverty compared to white children.

And I can't help reflect on a comment that I heard throughout the pandemic from a community leader who would say that she lost over 30 black community members and family members during the pandemic. And she asked me, what are electives going to do to respond to that? How many funerals did you go to? Do you know children are missing their grandparents, other extended family members? And my hope was that in pushing for this effort,  It would show that we have this willingness to not only fund and partner in this project to address harms and bring some love, but also bring some level of recovery and healing.

So the way this came about is in November, a woman came to my first constituent coffee hour asking me if I'd consider an ordinance to stop pet sales in stores. I didn't know a lot about this issue, but I learned through my conversations with her and through the director of the Huron Valley Humane Society that there's no oversight at the state or federal level on pet breeding conditions, as we heard from public commenter earlier.  This means that a significant number of puppies, kittens, and rabbits sold at pet shops are sourced from large-scale commercial breeding facilities, also known as puppy mills, kitten mills, rabbit mills, et cetera. They don't adequately provide for the health and the welfare of animals. According to the Humane Society of the United States, it's estimated that 10,000 puppy mills produce more than 2.4 million puppies per year in the United States.  and that most pet shop dogs, cats, and rabbits come from these mills. The documented abuses include overbreeding, inbreeding, minimal to non-existent veterinary care, lack of adequate and nutritious food, water, and shelter, lack of socialization, lack of adequate space, and lack of adequate exercise.  So this ordinance, if passed, would mean that no pet store in Ann Arbor shall offer for sale or dispose of dogs, cats, ferrets, rabbits, long-lived birds, or large reptiles. It's important to note that there's currently no stores selling pets in Ann Arbor. So what this ordinance really does is ensure that no pet store is ever, you know, ever does this practice in the future.  We modeled this ordinance on Washtenaw County's 2019 resolution that provided municipalities in Washtenaw County with a model pet acquisition ordinance. Nothing in this ordinance prevents a pet store from providing space or care to the rescued animals, and it also does not affect a consumer's ability to obtain  One of these pets directly from a breed specific rescue organization.

So this is an instruction  That change is something that council had asked for a few months ago. We had asked for tweaking to TC1 before it came to Plymouth and Washtenaw. Tonight we've heard the concern that one size zoning does not fit all and that we need to modify TC1 before applying it further. The question before us is not does one size fit all or not. The question is, is TC1 better than the current zoning? And the answer is yes.  Current zoning dates back decades. It permits outmoded land uses, such as development that is single story, inclusive of high ratios of automobile parking, and physically arranged in a manner that does not promote multimodal transportation options to or between sites. The TC1 zoning district restricts the creation or expansion of that kind of outmoded development, which is at odds with this city's initiatives towards  reducing carbon emissions by getting people out of their cars and onto their feet or their bicycles or into buses. There is an urgency to protect  both of the corridors that I've spoken about from the creation or expansion of outmoded development. But that does not mean that there will be hastiness in moving forward with the rezoning process. There will be public engagement before any proposal comes to Planning Commission. There will be public hearings at Planning Commission.  and public hearings at council. All of these meetings will be fully noticed to neighbors and will be publicized to the community at large. There is an urgency to rezone, but that does not mean that once the zoning is in place, we will see an immediate result. Zoning is a long game. I've said this before.

I've already heard about the different conservation easements within the area, the Miller Creek area.  But the major point here, I think, for me is Plymouth is a successful corridor. A lot of what we like, of what we want to see in TC1, it's already occurring. The corner of Plymouth and Green, the sweet waters where I host my coffee hours, it's a successful example of mixed use. Two floors of housing above businesses, local and national. Further down the corridor, we've seen successful infill,  you know, credit unions mixed with yoga studios, all sorts of things, built into an existing parking lot of a complex, filling in parking, using it for more creative and community and uses for community benefit.

I wanted to just call out, first of all, my gratitude and thanks to my Council of the Commons colleagues. I had actually requested to be appointed before I was elected to Council of the Commons, so I have been part of that group since its inception.  Basically, what this resolution states is that the Council of the Commons group has completed thorough research into other communities' central plazas, engaged with businesses, residents, and stakeholders, considered to be center-of-the-city block partners to receive feedback and direction, has coordinated with the Parks Advisory Committee on activities and ideas, and provided ample information on which the evaluation of the feasibility and vitality of a central plaza on the center-of-the-city site can be conducted by city staff and city council.  In short, a lot of hard work has gone into getting an analysis done as to what is possible and what other communities do with their center of the city initiatives in terms of a common place for folks to gather in the center of their towns. And a lot of work has gone into this. So I know that it's easy to say, you know, there isn't a lot to show for it.  I would disagree that a lot of research has been done. I know that people actually visited other communities, went and talked to the Council of Commons members, did go to other communities, did, you know, so much work on this. And it is to the point now where the conversations around those tables have devolved to a point of  lack of utility. So it is appropriate to disband that group and to refer these activities as indicated to the Parks Advisory Committee, which is, it is part of a park, it is designated as a park, and that is the appropriate use for that committee's time. So again, I want to thank my Council of the Commons colleagues for the work that they had done.  And also want to recognize, as was mentioned earlier, that the Council of the Commons itself did vote to dissolve itself in recognition of creating a roadmap that the city could then take and consider for future implementation and use.  Just in closing if you want to use that space nothing right now prohibits you from using that space Although there isn't built infrastructure there right now.

I have been working with our, our attorney, the housing commission's attorney on development projects, as well as our bond council to figure out what type of bonds work the best for different types of projects. And what we've been finding is there's all types of ways to issue bonds, both tax exempt,  and not tax exempt municipal bonds, bonds that require the state to use part of their bond cap to pass it down to us to utilize it. And all roads have been a dead end so far. And so we may end up having only one path that we can take if we also are utilizing what's called 9% low income housing tax credits, and that potential path  might only allow us to work directly with the city of Ann Arbor with their bond authority.

Dehoney and a couple of council members in advance of our budget our budget discussions and Mr. Dehoney basically said that's an interesting question. You need to ask me to ask that question and  And it really follows, and then also, probably a good idea to talk to Jennifer Hall. And I was really heartened in those follow-up discussions to learn more about the  what the market is like, what the market conditions are like. Not heartened to hear it, actually not thrilled to hear how difficult it is to build multifamily housing right now given those market conditions. Market Watch had an article back in April saying that on how housing starts had declined in March and that apartment construction had cooled. And what housing starts is is basically the number of homes that would be built over an entire year if construction took place at the same rate every month.  So this resolution echoes this economic outlook. It references the National Association of Home Builders report that combined single family and multifamily housing starts were 29.5% lower in the Midwest. And that's due to increased construction and transportation energy costs.  So ultimately, that leaves fewer options for buyers and renters. And how that impacts affordable housing can be really drastic. Because unlike market rate housing, which is funded with different capital stacks, they can address increasing costs by increasing rents. But with our projects, there's less flexibility when it's financed by HUD-backed loans.  So even if projects which are financed with LIHTC credits, there are developers across the country saying it's no longer financially viable to construct affordable housing. So we're not immune to these market conditions. My worry was that we need to start addressing our affordable housing crisis more quickly. And I'm hoping that this will enable us to build more housing.  We have 300 in the pipeline, but we're still so far from the 2,787 that we had dedicated ourselves to back in 2015. So these discussions have been fruitful. I've learned a lot. I wish we had more money more quickly for this work.  And I'm hoping that we can address this, similar to how we had addressed street repair when Mr. DeHoney had proposed bonding out for that work last year. So I'm hoping for good results.

Leveraging bond financing is a crucial tool to advance our commitment to affordable housing in Ann Arbor. This is not just an economic matter, it's equitable access to housing in Ann Arbor. Let's be clear, housing affordability is not a privilege, it is a right. An equitable city is where  is one where everyone, regardless of income, has access to affordable housing. For the most part, our city has always been prosperous, yet a significant portion of our citizens are denied access to affordable housing. Housing insecurity in the midst of wealth is not equity. Bond financing presents us with an innovative, promising solution that has the potential to act as a catalyst, transforming aspirations for housing equity into tangible realities.  We have the resources in the form of our city's affordable housing millage, generating around $6.5 million annually. It's time we put these resources to work more effectively and more quickly. Our millage revenue could be the key to unlock a brighter, more equitable future for our city. When we adopted Washtenaw County's housing pledge in 2020, we made a promise. We acknowledged housing is a fundamental human right.  and we took responsibility for making this right a reality for our citizens. Today we have the chance to prove that this was more than just words. Let's turn our pledge into action. Remember our goal just isn't creating affordable housing. It's about creating an equitable community where everyone can thrive. Affordable housing isn't just about shelter. It's about equal opportunity. It's about social justice.

This is clarifying that this is ongoing, looking at another angle, which is the bond financing. Mrs. Hall, I would wonder, could you talk a little bit about the unique conditions in Ann Arbor and how the fact that the area median income continuing to increase just makes everything harder from the Housing Commission's angle in terms of getting things built and also  financing specific to the Ann Arbor market?", "start": 10775.808, "end": 10868.969, "Transition": "\"\"", "Meeting Section": "Other", "Speaker Role": "Other", "is_public_comment": 0, "is_public_hearing": 0, "is_comment_start_trigger": 0, "is_comment_end_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_start_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_end_trigger": 0}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_38", "text": "That's a very long answer. I'd like to proceed that by saying thanks to Councilmember Song as well because I thought I was just answering questions so I had not prepared any kind of presentation so I appreciate your background. It's interesting because the $124,000 area median income  It does reflect the actual conditions of the marketplace in the competition for housing, but it also under-reflects it because of, and I've talked about this many times in the past, because of students who appear to be in poverty and low income.  may or may not be from a, you know, from their family situation, whether they came from poverty or not, or low income or not. So it's actually under representing what's happening in the marketplace. And even in particularly, not just even, but particularly low income students are having a really hard time even finding housing in Ann Arbor now as well. And we're hearing both anecdotal and real stories about our voucher tenants getting displaced from  the city of Ypsi and Ypsi Township and Pittsfield Township because of the students that are continuing to get pushed farther and farther outside the community. In an odd way, the $124,000 increase in median income is attractive to, maybe this is an odd, but to for-profit developers because the area median income doesn't  exactly ride the same way up and down over time as rents, but it's pretty close. So as income goes up, rent goes up. And so the various programs that we have to apply to put our capital stack together, the median incomes and the rents are much higher than most communities. So in some senses,  We're an attractive community to build affordable housing. If that's the type of housing that you do because you can charge more rent for like a 60% AMI household than you could in other communities. The problem is that our development costs are also higher on the front end. And so you're constantly  throwing the needle between figuring out how to keep your housing costs at an affordable, manageable level on the development side. Right now, our project on Catherine is running about $478,000 a unit, which exceeds what the state MSHDA limitations are for per unit cost. And so we've already gotten a waiver from them to allow us to exceed their per unit cost.  Um, but on the backside, you can also have higher rents, but that is from a for-profit affordable housing developer perspective. When you're coming from a perspective of a nonprofit mission driven, uh, housing developer, even though we could charge $1,600 a month in rent, um, to reach that 60% AMI or 50% AMI household.  that is not the rent that we desire to charge when unless we have a rent subsidy. And so the type of financing that we put together doesn't provide a rent subsidy. The only way you can do that is with a with a some kind of an actual voucher type program. So we will have units that we bring online  that will be affordable, but we are not pricing them at the maximum amount that can be generated, because we know that our households that we're targeting in the community, even at 60% AMI, $1,600 a month is a lot. So we're trying to get units priced at more in the $800 to $1,000 range, which still feels very high. So there's a lot of different factors. The market is  constantly changing you know record low interest a couple years ago and now we're it's definitely not record high interest just in our past decade or so the interest rates both on construction loans on permanent financing are extremely high compared to what they were even four or five years ago it's just making it really challenging to put your capital stack together which for us so far we have 12 different  funding sources right now just on one one project.

It's well known that moving a project through the development pipeline in Ann Arbor is often quite difficult and costly. And we just heard about just the external pressures as well and rising costs.

However, our local green developers, builders, and architects are informing us that our processes are particularly problematic for those trying to build innovative, sustainable residential buildings.

And we have no way to compel builders. We cannot say that enough. There are constraints on the building code in the state of Michigan and other aspects of state law that make it very difficult for us to compel the building of projects that are all electric.

This year we are presenting awards for Preservation, Rehabilitation, Centennials, and Special Merit. I'd also like to thank the committee that selected the awards, Patricia Austin, Grace Shackman, Frances Wright, Tom Stahlberg, Ellen Ramsburg, and Ina Hannell-Gerdnitsch. Special thanks are owed to our incomparable staff person, Jill Thatcher.  We believe that architecture is an art form which gives beauty to the public every day as they drive, bike, or walk through town. Tonight's awardees have generously provided this beauty to us and we want to show that we appreciate their work. Thank you awardees for this beautiful gift. And the first award is for  Preservation. Preservation awards are presented in recognition of superior maintenance of a significant property to preserve its essential historical, cultural, or architectural value for a period of 10 years or more. And the first award goes to 2115 Melrose Avenue  which is up on the screen. This is to Kenneth and Penelope Fisher. This handsome Tudor revival home was built in 1929 for James Dale, an insurance salesman. It features a steeply pitched roof, prominent chimneys, randomly extruded bricks, casement windows, and an arched top front door that combine to give the house a particularly medieval vibe. It has been the home of Ken and Penny Fisher since 1988. Are they here?  No. Okay. It's hard to give awards in June. Everybody's away often. The next award goes to the Church of the Good Shepherd at 2145 Independence Boulevard.  The Church of the Good Shepherd is a mid-century modern church designed by local architect Robert Metcalf and built by Arthur Chizik in 1957. It is a beautiful example of a non-residential structure designed by Metcalf and has been wonderfully maintained by the church.

This mid-century modern structure was the home of local architect James Livingston and built in 1958. Livingston designed many houses in this area in the 1950s. He also designed Lurie Terrace, Maynard House, Weber's Inn, Lawton School, and many houses in Washtenaw County's Thorn Oaks Historic District.  The home has been owned and beautifully maintained by Robert and Martha Ozzie since 1965. Obviously, you're here. Thank you so much. You're welcome.  Thank you for all you've done. Okay, next. Oops. The next preservation award goes to Anna Mapp and Adam Matsker for 2240 Belmont Road.  This mid-century modern home, you see a pattern here, in Ann Arbor Hills was designed by local architect George Brigham and built in 1952. It was described in an Ann Arbor News article as, quote, the pinnacle of livability and beauty, unquote.  It was built for Dr. Albert C. Furstenberg, a physician who served as dean of the UM Medical School for 25 years, and developed it into one of the foremost centers for medical research in the United States. Furstenberg Park is named after him. It has been owned by Adam Matsker and Anna Mapp since 2004. Anyone? No Mapp? No Matsker? Okay.  And the next house is pretty much next door.  is at 2228 Belmont Road, and its owner is Marilyn Lindenauer. Another mid-century modern house, this structure is one of only three residences in Ann Arbor designed by Alden Dow, who designed this building. Love it or hate it. Famous for his home and studio in Midland, and for many public buildings in Ann Arbor, including City Hall and the Ann Arbor District Library.  The house was built for Dr. and Mrs. Sidney Hubler in 1949. Hubler was a renowned cardiologist who founded one of the country's first hypertension clinics at the U of M. He served at the U of M hospital from 1947 to 74 and made the hypertension clinic an internationally renowned research center on high blood pressure. His home has been lovingly maintained by Martin and Marilyn Lindenauer, whose family has owned it since  at least 1992. Martin Lindauer was a professor of surgery at U of M for over 40 years and specialized in vascular disease. Is there a Lindenauer in the house? No? Another no-show. Okay, the next preservation award is for 3575 East Huron River Drive. The owner is Myra Larson.  An outlier on the banks of the Huron River, this 1953 mid-century modern unistrut house was designed by U of M professor of architecture Theodore Larson, an internationally recognized practitioner of modern design. The Larson family still lives here and maintains both the inside and outside of the house as it was originally designed.  Unistrut is a metal framing system with a unique weld-less connection. It has channels used to support heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems that are still in use today. I know she couldn't make it. I know that one.  The next preservation ward goes to Terry Mara for 717 West Huron. This lovely Tudor Revival style house has majestically looked over Huron Street since 1906. It was built for Titus Hutzel, a member of a prominent German family that installed central plumbing systems in Ann Arbor in 1900 and is still in business today as Hutzel Plumbing. Hutzel was also active in civic affairs.  serving as an alderman, president of the Board of Public Works, and trustee of Forest Hill Cemetery.

Yes, we can. Great, then I will get started. Hello, my name is Abigail McGinnis, and I'm a pediatric ICU doctor at C.S. Mott Children's Hospital. Doctors are seen as experts in safety, and as a pediatric ICU physician, I am deeply invested in the safety and well-being of our community members. Therefore, I am calling in support of the coalition for re-envisioning our safety, also known as CROS.  I'm excited that the resolution in support of the RFP issuance for the Unarmed Response Program affirms the importance of an independent non-police program that is accessible from a non-911 number and is in line with CROS's values. I have also read the Community Engagement Report by Public Sector Consultants and I am here to urge the City Council to prioritize the following three key findings in the report.  Firstly, to fund the unarmed public safety response from existing budget resources. Personally, I believe that some or all of this funding should be taken out of the existing policing budget. The city's commitment of ARPA funds to an unarmed response program is a great start, and ongoing sustained funding from the existing police budget is a great way to ensure this program remains robust, care-based, and accessible to all Ann Arbor residents. To me, this would demonstrate the city's commitment to addressing the root causes of conflict and crisis.  Secondly, the RFP should require the establishment of a separate number for unarmed response. A dedicated number for unarmed response can help streamline services, ensure appropriate response to non-emergency situations, and alleviate the burden on the 911 system.  Third and finally, the RFP should insist on the exclusion of police from the Unarmed Response Program. The program should focus on unarmed professionals for nonviolent situations, to reduce the risk of unnecessary use of force, as well as to enhance community trust and to encourage more effective community-based solutions.  By ensuring a non-police response, the Unarmed Response Program can be safely utilized by more people while simultaneously reducing the number of calls police are responding to. Reducing the number of police responses will alleviate the burden on Ann Arbor Police while freeing up existing police funds for other safety-promoting programs in our city.  I kindly request that the City Council take these findings into consideration when assessing the RFP for unarmed response and moving forward with its release. Finally, I want to extend my support for C2, the driving equality ordinance. As a pediatric doctor, I strongly support efforts to reduce interactions between police and residents, especially young residents and especially on our roads.  is a public health crisis that disproportionately harms our black, brown, and queer neighbors.

Do I look like a repeat offender?  I was half hoping for a yes, but I guess not. But, in fact, I am a cranky old woman who drives cranky old Volvos. One of which is cranky enough and old enough to have a headlight that is consistently out. I went to repair it. It went out again. I gave up at some point. It's been like that for a while. But you know what? I never get stopped. You know why?  First of all, I'm a cranky old lady. Second of all, they are kind of late-ish model Volvos. Third of all, there is a Harvard alumni plate on each of them that I very intentionally put there because my mama didn't raise no fool. I am black. I rarely get stopped.  But let's talk about the numbers because other people aren't so lucky. So the Michigan State Police itself studied itself in 2021. That data revealed that traffic stops conducted in daylight were 18% more likely to have Latinos and 11% more likely to have blacks as the subject of those stops.  A study in a neighboring state found that one-third of the stops for minor traffic offenses were stops of black and Latino drivers. They were stopped twice as often as white drivers and far overrepresented in searches in being handcuffs and in being detained. But the incidence of contraband or evidence was lower than that of white drivers.  So Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Seattle, Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, and Berkeley in California have all implemented policies to limit or eliminate traffic stops for minor violations. And I encourage the city of Ann Arbor to join them.  We can go down a list, you know, there are numbers and then there are names, right? Ty Nichols was pulled over and beaten to death for reckless driving. Daunte Wright was pulled over for an expired registration tag. Rayshard Brooks was shot to death for falling asleep in his car at a Wendy's. Gabriel Navarro was shot 17 times while driving. Sandra Bland killed because an officer said she failed to signal a turn.  And of course, Philando Castile, who, before the police finally killed him in 2016, had been pulled over a staggering 49 times for minor traffic violations. Between 2016 and 21, police killed over 400 drivers or passengers who were unarmed and were not being pursued for a violent crime. And an outside proportion of them, as we know, were black and Latino. And that's an average of one person per week.  Right? So a busted taillight is not impacting public safety, neither is loud music, or an expired tag, or a window tint. The overall crime rate for these municipalities who implemented policies... Is that... Okay.

Okay, wonderful. Um,  Okay. Hi, everyone. My name is Brian Gerringer. I'm here to speak deeply in favor of the proposal to stop executing traffic violations, stops by police in the city, the Pre-Tax stops. Decades of research have shown that traffic stops have an extremely disproportionate impact on black and brown and poor drivers, while white people driving fancy cars are subjected to an entirely different reality.  In some cases, like we have read about in Ferguson, Missouri, this leads to an outright cycle of terror for young, often poor, black men. We must soberly recognize that while Ann Arbor is not Ferguson, Ann Arbor is not not Ferguson, either. In fact, a recent report from the Citizens for Racial Equity in Washtenaw County, the crew report is damning, and I quote, the breadth of the racial disparities crew documented and the impact in terms of punishment on people of color are so stark  that CREW presents this report to our community with a call for immediate action by those institutions responsible for funding, administering, and overseeing the criminal legal system in Washtenaw County. The report found that in the county, prosecutors charge POC dramatically more than white people and that POC get worse treatment in the court system. The blatant reality is that the more contact that black people have with police, the more this racial disparity and punishment will widen.  And although that sounds bad, these are in fact life-ruining sentences, and the ramifications of these decisions are extremely serious. Nothing would be a racist and evil thing to do in this case. I'm looking forward to seeing how crows will begin to peel back the layers of policing in this county, finding, I hope, more and more instances in which the harsh punishment of imprisonment, as well as more minor retributions, are increasingly unnecessary. While we're at it, I would love to see Ann Arbor use its significant power in the county to encourage all municipalities to stop pretext stops  And I deeply encourage you to open a line of communication with the county prosecutor's office as well. The prosecutor's website states that they will, quote, no longer prosecute contraband cases that arise in pretext stops. Specifically, the prosecutor's office will no longer prosecute possession of contraband crimes that arise from a factual scenario, indicating that a police officer stopped a person for a minor infraction, but where their real goal was to uncover evidence that a civilian possessed drugs or other contraband. Unfortunately, the current reality is that the SABOT office is still prosecuting pretext stops,  It's their opinion that this policy stated on their own website only applies in scenarios in which the stop individual goes on specifically to give consent to the stopping officer to search their vehicle. This further specification of that policy renders it utterly unaware of the scope of this problem. Let us all be clear in our demand from the prosecutor to execute the pretext policy as stated. Stop prosecuting contraband from pretext stops immediately. And while I'm here, I'd quickly like to mention that if I were an Ann Arbor City Council member,  I'm just starting to worry about the city's biggest landlord and client, the University of Michigan, being under investigation by its accreditor for faking thousands of grades. You all might want to check on that and encourage them to make some confessions to GEO.

I'm Dr. Lisa Jackson, the former chair of Ann Arbor's Independent Community Police Oversight Commission. For years, I advocated for transparency and accountability in policing in Ann Arbor. I'm here today in support of the Driving Equity Ordinance sponsored by Councilmember Cynthia Harrison and others. I've been stopped for not taking my handicapped placard down soon enough after leaving a grocery store when my daughter was in a wheelchair. I've had colleagues who've been stopped for having a child's graduation tassel hanging with pride from their rearview mirror.  I don't believe that the police or anyone feel that either of these were a threat to public safety. I perceive them, however, to be a pretext by which to stop and interrogate people who look like me. When I discussed these issues with Chief Cox, and specifically the claim that some people are concerned about that tinted windows make police less safe, he reminded me that in Florida, Arizona, Nevada, and California, tinted windows are in regular use and they have not posed a threat to police.  maybe we can do an exchange program and send some AAPD to these summer climbs. I saw Amy here, so maybe we can do like a trade-off thing. After much advocacy and my working for over 14 months, as you guys know, to get accurate traffic stop data from AAPD, the Southeast Michigan Criminal Justice Policy Research Project, called SMART, has finalized a report of traffic stops in Ann Arbor from 2017 to 2019.  Data on 2020, which is the first COVID year, are being analyzed separately. I worked very hard, as you know, upstream on this issue because traffic stops are the number one way in which people come in contact with the police. Just as Michigan State Police found when they had researchers at Michigan State analyze their data, the SMART team at Eastern has found significant disparities in the way drivers are policed in Ann Arbor at every single dimension examined.  Non-white motorists are stopped and searched more frequently than white motorists. The largest disparities should surprise no one. African-American male drivers were stopped for equipment violations, such as a hanging tassel, over 200% more than would be expected by the data, and they were searched after such stops between 365% and 500% more than would be expected by the data.  Middle Eastern male drivers were stopped 81% more often, while white female drivers were stopped less than should be expected by the data. There are certainly other statistically significant findings. Overall, the antiquated processes by which police are allowed to stop motorists do not keep us safer.  Allowing, supporting, and turning a blind eye to police with the discretion to search people who look like me, Lisa Jackson, while letting people who look like Lisa Dish off with a warning, or more significantly, not stopping her in the first place, do not keep us safer. The city of Ann Arbor needs to live up to its progressive image and join Philadelphia, Los Angeles, and other cities who have relied on data to bring their cities into the 21st century and to decrease the disparities with which people come into contact with police by way of traffic stops.

Good evening, Mayor, Council members. I am the current chair of the Independent Police Oversight Commission. A few years ago,  Our son was a student at Pioneer High School. He played on the basketball team. One Friday evening, as was our custom, his father and I went to the basketball game. We sat there and watched him play. After the game, we all got up and we left together. In the parking lot, we stopped and spoke with some other parents. Our son got into his old raggedy car and started home ahead of us down stadium.  Within 10 minutes or so, we also proceeded down stadium on our way home. When traffic light, I'm sorry, lights of a police car drew our attention, we looked over. Now this was a cold, dark night. And we looked over to see our son's car and our son with his coat unzipped and hands up like this standing on the sidewalk.  We walked over, we parked and walked over. At that time, by the way, I was working for the city of Ann Arbor in the city attorney's office. No, I take, yeah, or was I in the prosecutor's office? One or the other. In any case, I walked over, I said, what's going on? They said, who are you? I said, we're his parents. They said, we stopped him because he fits the description of someone who just robbed a store over on Broadway.  I said, what was the description? Young black man with a knit cap on. Did I tell you it was cold out? We said, we just left him at Pioneer High School. The officer looked at me and said, well, when we pulled him over, we smelled marijuana.  I'm not one to believe my children never did anything wrong. I went to the car. I said, you didn't smell marijuana. The officer says, oh, you're going to tell me my job? I said, yeah, I was trying marijuana cases when you were in high school. I almost said that. But I held back. Then they said,  Well, we found a weapon in the car. Weapon in the car? My son, because of the age of his car, had a rock. He would start the car up in the morning and it would cut off if he just left it. So he'd start up, put the rock on the gas pedal, and go inside to finish getting ready for school. Absolute everything wrong, not true. This is what happens.  It didn't matter to the police that night that my son, our son, was a National Honor Society two-time letter winner, an all-around good guy. That evening, he was a black man with a knit cap on.

All right, so my very first interaction with police in my life, I was 12 years old, right here by University of Michigan Police Department by what was the Freeze Building. It's now North Quad, so I'm giving away my age here.  So I'm the embodiment of disparate traffic stops right here in Washtenaw County. My current case is being tracked by MLive and other local media outlets. Long story short, I was pulled over in Ypsilanti for failure to signal in a residential neighborhood and subsequently arrested for contraband.  I have never in my adult life committed a violent act, yet Ellie Savitt and Washtenaw County Police treat me as like a terrorist. I wonder why.  On the issue of police discretion in traffic stops, fact is discretion is not given to poor black people. Politicians the world over run these compassion campaigns, yet study after study, year after year, reveals ongoing patterns of anti-black, anti-poor, and anti-labor policing. NPR just revealed a Michigan State police study, once again affirming widespread and systemic disparities when dealing with black motorists in particular. But this is not news.  So how can poor, black, underrepresented constituents feel confident this will be any different? How are police and policy makers being held accountable aside from distractive identity politics to remind us, hey, at least we're not Trump? What is going to be gained from this discussion aside from thoughts and prayers?  There is the crew report, the Michigan State Police report, a mountain of scholarly academic literature in a valley of the mostly ignored and neglected experiences of millions of poor and black folks. This is both academic and simple. Black folks are adversely affected by discretionary policing, especially traffic stops. We even have a candidate for sheriff, a former beat cop who centered part of her campaign around eliminating quotas based on her personal experience as a cop.  Speaking engagements are great for PR, but what can voters actually expect? And to whom do they voice their opinions to since racist policing has been endemic for generations? In the words of Judge Arian Slay here in Washtenaw County, Washtenaw County prides itself on thinking left, but actually it looks right.  The idea that police need to do more to keep us safe is a force-fed idea, mostly by the Democrats. After all, the mood of the constituents at the time of their election in 2020 was to defund the police. How and when did the electorate suddenly change its mind on this issue? Or was this the decision of embedded elites who just cannot and will not fathom the terrifying prospect of the world changing before them? Of the political and fight... Am I done?  Thank you. Of the political and financial connections with the prison industrial complex and its irresistible and exhaustible golden honeypot. Thank you.

My name is Molly Kleinman, and I live in the fourth ward. I served for three years as chair of the Ann Arbor Transportation Commission, and I still sit on the commission, but I'm speaking tonight only for myself. I'm calling in support of C2, the driving equality ordinance. As an advocate for road safety and a transportation system that serves everyone, I'm strongly in favor of policies that reduce interactions with the police on our roads. I realize that might seem incongruous,  but consider that the American Public Health Association has declared police violence to be a public health crisis. There is extensive evidence that police and policing cause harm to black, immigrant, indigenous, queer people and other people of color, as does involvement in the criminal legal system. If we want our roads to be safe for everyone, that means we have to consider not only safety from traffic violence, but also safety from state violence.  Secondary traffic stops for things like a broken taillight, tinted windows, and loud exhaust do not make our roads safer. But tonight, we've heard a lot about the extensive evidence that they do disproportionately harm people of color. And we've also heard personal testimony about our Black neighbors' experiences with excessive traffic stops in Ann Arbor. Ending this practice will move us a step closer to the safe, equitable, and just transportation system Ann Arbor aspires to.  While I'm here, I also want to express support for DC6, the resolution in support of an RFP issuance for the unarmed response program. This resolution recognizes the importance of creating an unarmed response program that is run independently by a third party.

Let me relate a short story. I am Nancy Margolis, founder of Embracing Our Differences Michigan. We exhibit those huge banners in Gallup Park to promote discussions  and pride in diversity. One banner last year stimulated many discussions. A beautiful, gorgeous work by an Ann Arbor artist and dentist, Dr. James Lee, showed a young African-American boy jogging and driving. He entitled his work, Lift Up Your Voice and Scream.  On tours of the exhibit, so many black and brown mothers viewed this painting and shared with me how terrified they are each time their sons go out running or driving, how an innocent normal action can be misunderstood and can escalate.

This is Adam Driskevich calling from the Fourth Ward. I'd like to talk to you tonight about two items on your agenda, DC2 and C2. First, I'd like to talk about C2, the Driving Equality Ordinance. I am delighted to see this on the agenda tonight, and I hope to see it passed into the second reading unanimously and without being watered down. Thank you to Councilmember Harrison for bringing this forward, and for those of you who have already signed on as co-sponsors.  As we have seen in many cases around the country, interactions with police can be dangerous, particularly for people of color. We are not immune to that here, and we have seen the data showing that even we have disparities in how often people are pulled over and the outcomes of those stops.  This ordinance change will reduce these interactions with police, eliminating many that are, frankly, unnecessary anyway. Traffic enforcement can and should be limited to driving behaviors that are actually relevant to traffic safety, speeding, running red lights, road rage, failing to yield to pedestrians, and so on.  I hope the Driving Equality Ordinance will be uncontroversial among Councilmembers, as some other important ordinance changes have been, and I would love to see everyone jump on board to co-sponsor this tonight and at second reading. I would also like to mention that I am glad to see us continue to move forward with the RFP for an unarmed response program. I am following this with a lot of hope for what we can accomplish here in Ann Arbor with this and other reforms like the Driving Equality Ordinance.  I would also like to support DC2, the federal building plaza on Liberty Street. From my reading of this, it appears that the feds are going to be moving forward with redeveloping this plaza, whatever council has to say about it. I think it's great that we might be able to influence what these changes look like, and I like the ideas presented in the resolution. Pedestrianized streets are great, and I really enjoy our summer open streets over on Main Street.  If we can get a pedestrianized block of liberty out of the deal, it would certainly make that block more pleasant to visit. And what better place to put it than on the same block as the Blake Transit Center near the William and Division Bikeways? While I rarely bother to bring my car with me when I visit downtown, I know many people do. So the fact that it is only a block or so away from three large parking garages should alleviate that concern. Please also pass DC2 tonight.

There is no difference than what happens on the West Bank when a mother or a father or a son or a daughter or a grandparent in their own country have to have a work pass to go past a certain point. There's no difference from what went on in South Africa before their racial reconciliation with apartheid. There's no difference.  for you to take and pretend or any of us to take and pretend that this was a long time ago. Whereas here, right now, it's still happening today. Right now, not yesterday.

Hi, everybody. My name is Alicia Dyer. For anyone who doesn't know, I served in law enforcement for many years. So I'll be speaking from that perspective about the traffic stop ordinance. I want to say thank you all that have worked on this, especially Cynthia Harrison, who  I know has put a lot of effort in this. Thank you, Jen Cornell, for co-sponsoring. And this issue is really important for law enforcement in a lot of ways. When I worked as a deputy on patrol in Washtenaw County, I remember pulling somebody over as a new recruit because their exhaust was loud. And in training, that was one of the stops that they told us that we could pull people over for.  I remember going up to the car and I remember seeing how scared they were of me because of this situation. And I asked him, I said, hey, I just pulled you over for your exhaust being loud. And then they went on very quickly to tell me how hard they were trying to fix their car and how they just did not have the money.  I remember walking back to my patrol car and sitting there wondering, why are we pulling people over for this? And then the hard pill to swallow of causing the trauma I did and pulling this person over for this offense. And I think that I now have a social work degree. And I think when we think about traffic enforcement, what we need to realize is it is a traumatic interaction for a lot of people in our community.  For law enforcement, when we pull someone over, that can be a dangerous interaction. And so we should minimize those interactions whenever possible. We should make them for safety reasons, but we should not be making them because of a registration sticker that got put in the wrong spot, or an air freshener, or a crack in the windshield. These things really hurt the trust that we are trying to build in communities.  And so the more that we can do ordinances like this I think are a step in the right direction to start reducing the unnecessary contact that doesn't really need to take place if it's not a safety risk or a safety hazard. I think that this will also help protect younger officers so they won't have to go through that situation I did on patrol and have to live with that trauma knowing that I caused harm.  And so the more that we can start restructuring our laws and our ordinances and what we have law enforcement do, the better we can actually have a community where people are not being harmed, not being killed, and not being injured because of our practices. And so I just want to thank you all for your work. I especially want to thank Cynthia Harrison. I know that you put a lot of work into this.

But their intentions here for this plaza redevelopment are clear. The resource is at the ready, and we should catch that wave and ensure that we get the best possible outcome for the city and its residents.  Specifically, I want to support the intent to use all of the adjacent right-of-way on Liberty Street for inclusion in this plaza. Unlike some more challenging public sites downtown, this site has the ingredients for successful and vibrant public plaza space. It has active uses facing multiple sides. It has terra firma for sustaining trees and other vegetation. It is open and transparent to the surrounding streets.  There will be logistical trade-offs and complications for the adjacent parcels and for those traveling through downtown, but those are small costs relative to the potential benefits this kind of space will bring. While I'm here, I also want to support passing CT2 to limit pretextual stops by the police and encourage your ongoing support for creating and funding an unarmed response program by passing DC6.  Whenever we use armed police to respond to community needs, we inevitably risk that resolution will come at the end of the barrel of a gun or other violent force. And it is marginalized people, as we've heard tonight, multiple stripes that suffer an unequal burden, and this is an avoidable outcome. So thank you for all of your work on this.  And lastly, I also support the passage of C1 at first reading tonight. We're in a housing crisis. We need more housing of all kinds. It's a high demand area to live. It's a site that sat vacant for far too long. The developer's plan comports with the zoning ordinance that applies to the site. There's no reason not to say no. There's no reason to say no to 200 additional homes, especially since it's coming with almost no parking.

Hi, Council. I'm the Reverend Donnell White and I live in the 500 block of Silo Church Road in the 4th Ward. I'm calling in to speak in support of the Driving Equity Ordinance C2. The majority of policing and police interactions with civilians nationwide occur during traffic stops. These are often civil infractions. But racial inequity is endemic in our criminal justice system.  And one key driver of those inequities is the so-called pretext or pretextual stop. These stops are made by police officers as a result of an observed traffic or ordinance infraction.  but they are really about an officer wanting to uncover evidence or to conduct a search. The data shows that black motorists are significantly more likely to be subjected to pretextual stops than white people, and pretextual stops are heavily associated with racial profiling.  As you know, your own Independent Police Oversight Committee noted during their update to Council on June 5th that this data isn't just coming from out there, nationwide. It's actually right here in Ann Arbor. According to the research conducted by the SMART Center at EMU,  that evaluated AAPD stop data from 2017 to 2019, it found significant disparities across every dimension examined. Black motorists are being stopped and searched in Ann Arbor more frequently than white residents. It makes it unsafe for me, a black resident, who is male, to drive in our city.  Now, what I've noted is you cannot train away racial bias. You actually have to change the underlying systems that allow racial bias to harm people like myself and other residents.  Anything else is a policy decision. It's a policy decision to support the ongoing racial bias that's embedded in our existing system. So I am incredibly grateful to Councilmember Harrison for taking on this important issue to ensure that I can move about the city freely. In addition, I want to offer my support for DC6, and I'm grateful that Unarmed Public Safety is moving forward in Ann Arbor.  I was heartbroken when I heard about Scott Fitzpatrick's experience when he called for a mental health wellness check, but instead watched his wife get arrested. They then incurred over $10,000 in fees and fines, and they have to live with the trauma of that experience for the rest of their lives.  This was a categorical failure of our community to care for each other. And so I'm grateful that the PSC Community Engagement Report affirms with the coalition re-envisioning our safety has already proposed over a year ago that public unarmed safety should be...

Question one comes in regards to the statement in the resolution. However, staff also found that deeds to additional lots within the park contain racial restrictions, either on the deeds themselves or by reference to other deeds that contain  racial restrictions. The question is, what do you mean by reference to the other deeds? Um, the second question is, what are, what were the racial restrictions? Um, Alma Dinger Park is made up of lot of a variety of lots donated by various individuals. Uh, the lots donated by almond beyond the family did not have any racial restrictions on the deed. However,  Other donated lots did have the racial restrictions, which are the lots within this resolution. In regards to what were the restrictions, the most common restriction was that no portion of the land herein described shall be occupied by persons other than the Caucasian race except as servants or guests. So that was question one. I will go ahead and go to number four.  which speaks to the whereas clause of whereas the City of Ann Arbor Parks and Recreation Services strives to provide exceptional experiences for all park visitors and residents, regardless of race, age, gender, sexual orientation, income level, ethnicity, or ability. Whereas the Park Advisory Commission believes everyone should feel safe, welcome, and respected in the city parks, and that removing these prohibitive restrictions from the deeds associated with Allmendinger Park is consistent with this goal.  Question related to that statement is, does this mean the Park Commission will perform a comprehensive review of all city parks to see if such other covenants exist? In speaking with PAC and at the PAC meeting, PAC fully supports the review of all city properties determined if other covenants exist, and PAC and park staff will follow the directive of council regarding this process.

I'm going to respond to the rest of the questions. Question number two, on December 13th, 2022, the state of Michigan enacted the Discharge of Prohibited Restrictive Covenants Act, which allows Michigan property owners and Michigan community associations to record a discharge that affirmatively removes discriminatory restrictions from deeds and other recorded documents. How could a property owner do this?  is the first part of that question, and it says community organization. Does this mean these restrictions may exist on commercial real estate deeds as well? The process is detailed in the Discharge of Prohibited Restrictive Covenants Act, which is found at MCL 565.861. The statute provides a form  And a property owner can complete the form, have it notarized, and record it with, in our case, the Washtenaw County Recorder of Deeds, which is what is proposed here. There is also a simplified process defined for homeowners associations and for platted subdivisions and association boards for condominiums to take action at the request of those members.  These are the organizations that were being referred to in the memo as community associations. These residential restrictions could exist on commercial real estates, property use, changes over time, and although these were restrictive covenants for residential and they're illegal and enforceable, that language could still exist in those documents.  Question number three, whereas the lots with restrictions are within Oakcrest subdivisions, lots 147, 48, 49, et cetera, does the Oakcrest subdivision still exist?  If so, does the rest of the subdivision still have the covenants? The city attorney's office did not complete a search for any property outside of park land owned by the city. It was just out of the scope of what we were asked to do. The platted subdivision, Oak Crest subdivision, which included Almendinger Park, included lots from Oak Creek subdivision. So it would follow that there are likely other lots that reference the same illegal, unenforceable, restrictive covenants.  Question number five, the city owns and has recently acquired land for the Greenbelt. Did any of that land have racial covenants on the deeds? If so, did the staff already go through the steps to discharge them? And our answer is the city has not reviewed the deed history for recently required properties for racial covenants or any other illegal unenforceable covenants. We can ask title companies to review this in future transactions proactively. Question number  Number six, does staff know if any of the Ann Arbor Public School-owned land has racial covenants on the deeds, including the new lots the district recently purchased? For example, we know that certain neighborhoods and subdivisions had racial covenants, as the Hannah subdivision recently had their racial covenant discharged last year. The assumption would be that a school within that subdivision area could have a covenant as well, depending on when it was built, correct?  and that staff has no knowledge. Properties not owned by the city were not proactively researched for racial covenants. It was just this one-time action. And then finally, seven, does council need to pass a resolution for a comprehensive review of deeds for city-owned land, or can staff do that in accordance with our past equity resolutions?  We will incorporate a search for these restrictive covenants proactively in future property acquisitions and when we have other reasons to be researching deeds. But I would ask that council pass a resolution for us to complete a comprehensive review after further consultation with the administrator and the city attorney due to the significant resources involved. There are approximately 165 parks with some consisting of multiple parcels  without including other city properties, such as City Hall, for example, which has about eight parcels underneath it. A quick, very preliminary estimate is that it would take 400 to 500 hours minimum to complete the searches for parks property only, which may only be possible using city attorney's, city attorney office staff, a consultant, or title company.

Thank you. My name is Glenn Wazorek. I'm the engineer at the Water Treatment Plant. I will be introducing CA-18 and responding to two questions. By way of introduction, sorry, thought you'd want to look at my face maybe.  By way of introduction, this resolution requests acceptance of a grant for PFAS treatment upgrades at the water treatment plant. More specifically, the grant program is called the Consolidation and Contamination Risk Reduction Grant Program, which will be administered by EGLE, Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy.  The grant amount is $491,122, to which we are proposing the design and construction of two filter upgrades to strengthen PFAS removal performance. The two questions proposed to me, CA18 question one,  It reads, since we're replacing only two of the lower profile underdrains, I'm assuming we still need to eventually fund the replacement of the 14 other underdrains that need more clearance to more efficiently filter PFAS. In the meantime, how are we addressing this issue? Are we actually running the water plant at a lower capacity, or do we have another way to remove the PFAS?  A response to question one, our current flows at the water plant are well below the plant's design capacity of 50 MGD. So the filters are operating well below their maximum capacity, but we don't want to restrict the flow as demand increases over time. It's important to note that we are meeting all PFAS  regulations under all current conditions. We are constructing these two filters to take advantage of the grant and to validate performance prior to investing in the remainder. But due to excess capacity, we have additional time where we'll likely be incorporating the remaining filters in a future capital project.  CA18 question number two reads, regarding the project budget, the memo says $1 million of the required $1.291 million for this project is included in the approved fiscal year 24 water supply capital budget. The EGLE grant is providing $491,000  Why does another $291,000 need to be appropriated? Wouldn't this grant bring us to $1,491,000 in available funding? There's a lot of numbers.

The water fund must front the full project cost. This is a financial accounting practice requirement. The water fund will be reimbursed the full grant amount of $491,000 when it becomes available.

As of Thursday when I visited several pet shops,  none of the stores had heard of the proposed ordinance. The three stores visited that sell live animals are all impacted by this ordinance. The point being all stakeholders should have been brought in early into the discussion, not just in this past week or two.  The ordinance erodes consumer protection. Under Michigan compiled law, MCL 281.3358, section 5, pet stores are required to have current pet health care certificates valid within 30 days from the sale of a dog or cat at retail. Shelters do not have the same requirement.  Pet stores also have certificates of origin for all their animals. The consumer will know what qualified breeder or qualified licensed kennel the dog or cat came from.  The ordinance shrinks consumer options with the goal of matching families' lifestyle with the dog's temperament. Random source dogs do not fulfill that goal. A 2017 study by the ASPCA and the study by the American Pet Products Association showed that 3.3 million dogs entered shelter. Meanwhile, close to 90 million pet dogs are in the United States.  The average lifespan of a dog is 11 years. The annual rate of death of dogs is close to 9 million pet dogs a year.  The ordinance plan is unsustainable. Over the past several years, shelters intakes have been going down. The demand for dogs have been going up. An MSU study showed that the proportion of households owning dogs is expected to grow from 38% of all US households to 45% in 2030. Shelters will not be able to come close  to the close to 6 million dog gap between shelter intake, getting a new family dog, and growing demand for dogs. Even now, some shelters are importing dogs from out of state to fill their kennels.", "start": 6322.838, "end": 6493.664, "Transition": "\"\"", "Meeting Section": "Public Hearing", "Speaker Role": "Commenter", "is_public_comment": 0, "is_public_hearing": 1, "is_comment_start_trigger": 0, "is_comment_end_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_start_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_end_trigger": 0}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_42", "text": "Is that it?

I'm Tanya Hilgendor from the CEO of the Humane Society of Huron Valley and longtime Ann Arbor resident. I'm here to give our enthusiastic support and gratitude for this ordinance to ban inhumane pet retail sales in Ann Arbor. There are currently an estimated 10,000 puppy mills operating in the United States, confining roughly 500,000 dogs solely for breeding.  Nearly all pet stores and online dealers get their puppies from mills notorious for abuse and neglect. The less well known this is also true for kittens and other animals sold as pets.  Though many mills are unlicensed, even if licensed, regulations are woefully lacking and minimally enforced. The rules around commercial breeding are almost 60 years old and don't address what we now know today scientifically about what animals need mentally and physically. Rather, they ensure just enough to keep the animal alive in their misery. Animals kept in mills are treated just as commodities and their most basic needs, food,  medical care are denied to increase profit margins. In puppy mills, mother and father dogs spend their entire lives in small, stacked, wire-bottom cages, required to just be six inches larger than their actual bodies their entire lives.  They never play, go for a walk, or snuggle with a family. Sickly mothers are forced to have litter after litter until their bodies are spent, and they are killed in cheap and violent ways.  Meanwhile, Michigan pet stores go 100% unregulated. In 2008-19, HSHV investigated a local pet store that let, among many violations, let sick puppies die in a back room without any vet care and just left their bodies there.  Their puppies came from a Hillsdale puppy mill that was also investigated by the Attorney General. Both operations continue to thrive today because of absurdly mild penalties and unsuspecting consumers. Of course, we prefer that families adopt a homeless animal and help save a life. But when that can't happen, we ask that consumers go directly to small family responsible breeders where good living conditions can be verified in person.  Pet stores and online dealers are the lifeblood that keep puppy mills alive. Until we have federal action like we saw in the UK, ordinances like this are an effective and important step forward to stemming this intense and systemic cruelty.

My name is Lauren DeLega. I am the current resident of Franklin, Michigan, but I'm a lifetime resident of Michigan. Just wanted to call and express my support and encourage the council to pass the pet store ordinance tonight.  As someone who is very active in the animal rescue community, I've had personal experience caring for dogs that come from puppy mills that had been intended to be sold at pet stores. Instead, these dogs are either aged out of their cute phase or the female dogs were no longer valuable because they couldn't have any more litter. These dogs spend most of their life filled with fear. Even after spending months in foster homes, they're typically extremely anxious and there may be no correcting that.  And just to be clear, there is no reputable breeders that will sell their dogs to pet stores. We've talked to just hundreds of them. They deal with the families directly. So this ordinance in no way stops reputable breeders from selling their dogs to families. So, you know, families are still able to get dogs directly from breeders if there's a specific breed that they're looking for. And then in addition to the problems surrounding the puppy mill pipeline and pet stores really lack the proper living conditions for almost all species.  The overcrowded small living spaces are necessary to show animals to consumers, but it's really not adequate for any animal to thrive. That's not only true for dogs and cats, but it also includes birds, rabbits, and reptiles. So this ordinance is very important not only to protect these voiceless animals, but to also protect the public. So I appreciate your time and consideration.

And also, are there any stores that are problems in Ann Arbor? And I would hope that the council and mayor, you think about collective punishment and only focus on bad actors and people in stores who are problems. You know, I hate to see these things pass when, you know, someone could be doing it right. I worked for a pet store in  College, I've trimmed hundreds of dog and cat toenails. We were mainly a grooming business, but occasionally we sold puppies, and we socialized with puppies. The owner was a veterinary technician. Numerous times I saw her spend an hour or two with people who would come in crying because their veterinarian would not spend enough time with them to go over common pet nutrition facts with them, and instead just wanted to prescribe medications. And I saw her turn over 100 unhealthy puppies into healthy puppies. And this was a legitimate pet shop owner who did a great job for the community.  and those animals, and something like this would have put her out of business. And it's just a shame to see that happen. Our puppies all came from very small breeders who were locally, they were all locally sourced. And again, this would put a store like her out of business. And there are lots of Michigan laws, including Chapter 750, chapters  9 and 25 of Chapter 750 that address pain and suffering, duty to provide care, animal cruelty, and more. So hopefully those laws could be in place regarding reptiles. Every animal coming into the state requires a USDA veterinarian certificate of veterinary inspection. So that's covering your reptiles. And again, I would hope that rather than painting this with a broad brush, you actually look at people who have problems  People are always going to have pets, and you're taking away the most public and heavily regulated possibility for them to get those pets. And who knows where they may get their pets from? So I would hope that you would allow responsible pet stores to stay in business in Ann Arbor.

I have lived at 1321 Forest Court for over 40 years. I am strenuously opposed to the application for a PUD project at 721 South Forest. I strongly support the thoughtful analyses of Matt Kowalski and the Planning Department staff to reject  this project. The proposed luxury student apartment building is totally inconsistent with the zoning of this site and the land use goals of the city's master plan. It significantly exceeds any density and building size permitted for this zoning district. It disregards the existing buildings around it on and adjacent to South Forest between Forest Court and Hill, a diverse and pleasant area of well-maintained residences, small apartment buildings, fraternity and sorority houses, and a child care center.  It contravenes the central area land use recommendations that seek to encourage appropriate development and transitions and to protect the existing character of neighborhoods. This project clearly does none of this, unlike the recently constructed small apartment buildings at 727 South Forest and adjacent to it at 1315 Hill, as well as the Towsley Children's House.  The proposal is in complete violation and makes a mockery of the zoning created by the City Council in recent past, establishing D1 and D2 zones with transitional step-downs to preserve the character and integrity of the R4C area surrounding.  It seeks to do via a PUD what the established zoning will not allow. Ignoring the city master plan and central area plans for this PUD is not how city planning is done, nor should Ann Arbor be remade through single-site spot zoning.  like this.

I spoke in favor of this rezoning at the Planning Commission. I am here to speak in favor of it here tonight. The site is immediately next door to another previously contentious high-density development proposal, Forest Plaza.  which nearly 100 years ago, was originally proposed as a luxury nine-story building on the street. This proposal triggered anti-development backlash, forcing the reduction of a building by four stories and forcing the building back from the edge of the lot. And it also led to further restrictions in our zoning ordinance that limited dense development near campus.  One of a few series of backlashes that happened through the history of the city that has limited housing. This PUD is a symptom of a problem that we began creating for ourselves 100 years ago. We have had the good fortune to live in a city that is home to one of the premier public universities on the planet, created and supported by the people of the state of Michigan. The significant public investment creates a natural demand for housing as closely as possible to campus.  This was true 100 years ago, and it remains true today. Our efforts to limit the ability to build and to meet this demand has created the reality that we live in now with scarce, expensive, often extremely low-quality housing to anyone who wants to live in our city. If we had allowed many more forest plazas as originally proposed 100 years ago, we would have avoided digging our housing hole yet deeper, putting further barriers up to substantial new housing  for subjective preferences or to reach goals that can't practically actually be realized right now, will contribute to our history of exclusion, contribute to our ongoing case of housing scarcity. So I please encourage you to approve this proposal tonight.  And I did describe this PUD as a symptom. There's other PUDs coming in the same area. I agree with the previous speaker. We're probably going to see more of these. And it's a symptom that something's wrong. I still think we should approve it because the housing situation is desperate. But I think we really need to be rethinking our zoning much more broadly. But we don't have time to wait five years for a comprehensive plan rewrite, ordinance rewrites, just to provide enough housing for the people who want to live here now.  And we know downtown, nothing new really has been built or approved since the recent ordinance updates a few years ago. We've put up all kinds of barriers. We have an unwritten rule book that we hear at Planning Commission over and over again of things we'd like to see that lead to rejections.  You know, all of which are goals I think we all share, but we're not getting what we want using the tools we've been using forever. And so I think if we want to actually get there, we need to start taking a little bit of risk, allowing some things to happen, and actually letting people meet the demand that is there.

If you look around downtown and if you look around South University, there is tons of new development. We have not been slow to develop recently. First of all, I hope that you will consider these things when you consider granting PUD status here. You're planning  staff and your Office of Sustainability both gave reports that asked you to deny the approval of the PUD. This should give you pause. You have experts on your staff who are saying this does not meet the requirements for a PUD. Their reports are well substantiated, and they give ample reason of why this does not have the public benefit for a PUD.  Any proposal to circumvent an existing zoning by use of a POD should give you pause, should make you think about the planning process and whether it's a valuable tool for a city to use.  These comments came up in the planning commission. A planning commissioner was asked, the commissioner asked the developer, if perhaps a change of zoning would be more amenable to the kind of development that he was proposing. And the reply was, it took too long to do that.  Thus the resort to a speedy alternative, a PUD that circumvents the zoning, that does not take into consideration the neighborhood or what the long-term plan for this neighborhood is. Another commissioner said, if not here, where?  Within walking distance of that site are some empty lots. There is an empty lot at Washtenaw and Observatory. There's something that's being used as a parking place across Washtenaw. There are alternative sites that don't require removing a relatively affordable student apartment building and putting in something that will be  both disregarding the nature of the neighborhood and will not be more affordable.

Our organization has owned this home since 1933, and we feel it adds to the historic nature of the surrounding area and the nearby historic district. We strive to maintain the home's charm and character while keeping up with today's requirements of college students, like Wi-Fi that's super fast, right? And interesting enough, you know, I think we feel  You know, honored to be near a home that was actually honored tonight. Because we feel very proud of our home and the architecture of it. We're definitely sympathetic to the issues the proposed development would help to resolve in Ann Arbor, including a housing crisis.  We see it with our members, you know, who look to move out of our home and live somewhere else in the city. And it's hard to find that and there's a lot of tension to, you know, secure something early.  We know we're a prime location, that area. We're close, obviously, to campus and many amenities along South University. And we agree that something needs to be done for the students as well as other residents in the city of Ann Arbor. But we do have several concerns. The large footprint of the building and its height will infringe upon the neighboring homes and apartments. Yes, it's only a few buildings away from the taller structures on South U, but it will tower over the properties directly north, south, east, and west, including our home.  We're concerned about the impact of traffic flow and parking in the area. We're worried about the impact to the trees and the green space in the area, as others have said. We're concerned about the aesthetic of the building as it sits less than a block from the historic district, like I mentioned, and across from our home that we feel is charming and old and carries its own proud history.  We're concerned about how this development will impact future development on the block. It's, you know, I think others have said this, it seems like it could be the first of many in our area or, you know, around Ann Arbor. And we know there's something actually in the works right behind us on Church Street, another high-rise apartment building for residents.  We realize that this resolution for the proposed development will likely pass for many reasons. In the city planning commission meetings, we heard there's a strong desire to move forward for many members as well as many citizens, again, to solve the housing crisis in Ann Arbor.

Simply pointing to a housing crisis to say we need more housing and this housing really being intentionally for students, wealthy students.  The small buy-in to the affordable housing, we would be happy to see a more appropriately sized, truly stepped down, appropriately zoned building that was newer, LEED certified, that did all of the environmental things that you're interested in.  also included affordable housing, I would enthusiastically support such a building. Simply saying we need more housing for students isn't going to solve our housing crisis. Does this mean we can just put houses anywhere? I mean, put tall apartment buildings anywhere, right? As an owner, I am not savvy to zoning, right? That's why we have staff in the city who do this.  However, as an owner of a house, I do think that it's important for me to be able to think that the zoning that has been put out by the city as part of a master plan will be followed in cases like this. And I've been on all the meetings, and it was very quiet in the last meeting. I did not hear anything except for, we need more housing for students. And I know at least one of our council members came in tonight with a vote fixed. His mind was fixed walking into tonight.  I heard this and that concerns me. We're here for public comment, really important and thoughtful public comments have been made in opposition to this. And I strongly urge you to think about the fact that once this building goes up, it cannot easily come down, right? It's going to be there forever. It's going to shade homes, it's gonna change a whole neighborhood. And where does it stop?  And why are we ignoring all of the empty lots? There are many empty and open lots. We're ignoring them because we don't have a developer from another city and paid consultants advocating for one of those buildings. Those lots aren't being proposed for development, and we have buildings being finished. I've walked that neighborhood today, as I do most days, and I look at this and it doesn't fit. It's not a step down.  The area, the land is not being underutilized. And this won't really fill a need by itself. We need to be more thoughtful about how we use all of the space and how we think about putting appropriately sized buildings, including high rise apartments in the places where they fit, not simply shoving them into the neighborhoods in the name of a housing crisis. I really encourage you to think this through. This is a big decision. Once it goes up,  It doesn't come down, and there are many more behind it.

It's it's too late for slow steps. We're in a housing crisis. We are in a climate crisis. As I said about this proposal at Planning Commission, I'm confused why staff is recommending denial.  It is appropriate for the surrounding area and has a number of benefits for our city. This building would be within a couple blocks of several other buildings of comparable height and density in an area dominated by student housing and student bars and clubs. It's a block from Rick's.  We are in a housing crisis with a high demand for housing and not enough supply. This would add significant number of units to our local housing supply. That in itself is a benefit to our city. We are also in a climate crisis and again this development ticks a number of boxes. There have been a number of discussions around encouraging electrification or even banning natural gas. Well this development is fully electric.  We are installing solar panels so that some of the energy needs will be generated on site. They're increasing the efficiency of the envelope with extra insulation to eliminate thermal bridging. All of these are great and seem to be above and beyond what we require in the building code. Another benefit.  This location is easily walkable to campus and to local businesses that are frequented by students. It's right in the thick of things in terms of student living, so residents will likely not need to drive much. This is great because we are trying to cut vehicle miles traveled in half. This benefits our Vision Zero goals as well as our A20 goals. Furthermore, this building would pay $4.7 million into our affordable housing fund.  which Jennifer Hall and the Housing Commission can leverage into more wonderful developments like 121 Catherine, the old wide lot at 5th and William, and other projects coming down the pike. These benefits to the city seem substantial to me, hence my confusion. This seems to check all of the boxes. Please approve this rezoning and the site plan tonight.

We could say, hey, this is just the way we like it.  I don't want it to change. But then it'll change anyway because the price of housing will go higher and higher, the more exclusive we get. The community will change anyway because the impact of all the people who have to live outside of town and drive in will be felt by us as we have to make more and more parking lots for people who have to drive in from outside.  So I think it's very important that we allow new housing developments, allow new neighbors, allow new community members. And this is a great opportunity to do all of that. You know, even if it didn't have all of these, all of these specific environmental things that they're doing, such as full electrification and the thermal insulation,  It would still be a boon for our community and it would still be a net gain for environmentalism because it would allow more people to live car free and to walk to school and walk to work and walk to the things that they want to do.

Hi, Adam Goodman speaking to you from the 5th Ward. You've heard this from other people, but I'm going to say it again. The city of Ann Arbor is facing a housing affordability crisis. This means that we need more housing at all income levels, both market rate and subsidized.  And this project that is in front of you tonight would do a significant amount to address both of those needs. It would directly provide a significant number of units of market-rate student housing in a location that, frankly, I can't imagine a better one for high-rise student housing. It's two blocks from campus. It's a block from Ricks. Where else are we going to do something like this, right?  But also, as part of this project, there will be a contribution of, I believe the number was something like $4.7 million, the Affordable Housing Fund. This is badly needed. A couple of years ago, residents of Ann Arbor passed a millage to raise money to pursue a lot of very ambitious affordable housing construction projects.  That millage was never going to be enough to meet our ambitions. And this has gotten worse. Because of inflation, supply chain issues, and various other problems, construction costs for affordable housing have skyrocketed. I have seen, and I'm sure you have seen, many discussions, presentations, and memos from city staff speaking to this exact issue.  The city needs a lot more money in the affordable housing fund to achieve the goals that you have set out for it. And I'm not going to claim that this one project will solve all of that, but let me put it in perspective for you. $4.7 million is more than 70% of the money raised from the entire city or the affordable housing fund millage in a year. This would  This would get most of the way towards doubling the amount of revenue you would get for the affordable housing fund in a year. And by increasing the tax base, it would provide a permanent increase to the money raised by that millage and every other millage. So. 30 seconds.

I don't know how that works scientifically, but I just think that the idea that someone can say remove the air and then just get to completely ignore both the housing crisis and the impact on the environment that comes from sprawl, because here's the thing about people. If you don't build homes for them where they want to live, they still got to live somewhere.  And if they can't live where their jobs are, they spread out.

I greatly appreciate it. My name is Alyssa Miller. I'm with the Pet Advocacy Network. And on behalf of the responsible pet care community, we are asking that you vote no on this proposed ordinance and work with the entirety of the stakeholders to create a humane ordinance that would benefit the community at large.  All of us in the responsible pet care community are dedicated to ensuring that the appropriate care of animals is the primary focus of any law or regulation. At the Pet Advocacy Network, we regularly work with all levels of government to make sure that any law or regulation that is put in place has the interest of animals and responsible and healthy animal-to-human companionship at heart. We welcome the opportunity to work with the City  in raising the bar to ensure proper animal sourcing that would protect dogs, cats, ferrets, rabbits, long-lived birds, and large reptiles. And a common-sense solution would be to require that animals only come from appropriate licensed breeders while working with the existing Ann Arbor pet store community.  It's been mentioned both in the press and here tonight that there are no statutory regulations that govern pet stores. And concerned about these claims, I actually reached out to the program manager at the state level for all shelter and breeding programs to inform me that pet stores indeed do have state statutory requirements. And depending on what animals and species they sell or adopt, they may also have federal and local animal orders requirements.  So, luckily, the federal government and the state of Michigan have taken steps to protect and ensure the safety of animals by enacting several layers of regulation and law. Walt-Well intentioned retail pet sale bans will not stop the bad breeder for unregulated, unlicensed, and not held accountable. We agree that these bad actors who mistreat and neglect animals must and should be put out of business, but unfortunately,  and we have seen them have the opposite effect, oftentimes creating an unregulated black market for pets, including, again, dogs, cats, and the animals that are included in this ordinance. In California, when they announced a statewide ban, vets saw an uptick in sick animals that had been purchased online  And there was no way to provide any recourse for the animal or the owner who was seeking the best care for it. Again, we hope and we would love to be able to work with the city to create an ordinance that would benefit everyone, including the animals and protect animals while also protecting pet choice and allowing the residents of Ann Arbor to be able to choose the pet that best fits them, their current situation and their family.

Hi, this is Lisa Devens. I live at 1312 Cambridge Road, Ann Arbor.  I would like to echo the others who spoke about denying 721 South Forest PUD. It seems like our zoning laws mean next to nothing now with all these exceptions for high-rises in neighborhoods where they do not belong. As others have said, this building was denied by staff for a number of good reasons. I want you all to think about the dangerous precedence that you are setting by approving these PUD high-rises south of South University.  I live half a block from a number of student rental houses on South Forest, a few blocks south of the 721 South Forest site in North Burns Park. And I wonder all the time, what if a developer purchased those rental houses on South Forest and applied for a PUD to build a high-rise there, just like what just happened on Church Street? My beautiful 1910 half-timbered house, which easily could have been featured in the historic preservation presentation earlier,  has been lovingly maintained at great expense to us over the years. Next door to a high-rise, it would become worthless. So would our quality of life. If my South Forest nightmare comes true, more high-rises will probably follow, destroying a longstanding historic neighborhood through the misguided notion that the city is somehow contractually responsible for creating housing for University of Michigan students. It is not.  I want each and every one of you to think about what you would do if this happened on your block or around the corner from your home. The way that this council prioritizes developers over neighborhoods shows a dismaying lack of respect and short-sightedness. Ann Arbor already has plenty of high-rise zones. That is where they should be building high-rises. It is simply unfair and wrong to grant these exceptions for these luxury private dormitories  that the city seems so obsessed with. They have not solved our housing problems over the last 15 years, and they won't do so now. The more you approve these high-rise PUVs, the more you will embolden developers to propose them in the first place where they do not belong. I am begging you, please don't open the door to this trend cascading down South Forest. That is what my family would call a housing crisis.

Hello, my name is Nishant Kedarpal. Thank you for taking the time to hear my comments today. I live in Ward 5 on Liberty Street. I am in huge support of this project. It is already a bunch of student apartments instead of being old.  and including a lot of parking, they will be modern, environmentally friendly, electrified, contribute to the affordable housing fund, and they will house more students than they do right now. Some of those people might not be students, but given the neighborhood, like others have said, it's a no-brainer that this should house as many students as possible on this parcel. You know, my own personal experience is informed by growing up in the city, having siblings who went to the university for undergrad, and now myself attending as a grad student.  And it's hard to find housing. And in particular, there are students, particularly undergrad students, folks from, say, out of state with more family resources, who can afford to live in more expensive, newer buildings. And by building modern, high-rise student housing with attractive amenities,  that keeps lower-priced housing in the rest of the neighborhood, older buildings, et cetera, available. And so we should be building as much of this as big as possible, as few vehicle parking spots as we can. And, you know, without those, it would be crazy to turn down almost $5 million.  So, yeah, and I'm in strong support of this bill. This is PUD, and I urge the council to make systematic changes to the Uniform Development Code such that these things don't need to get hauled in front of council and the planning committee, especially when we're doing good work on bi-rights rezoning in other corridors of the city. If you want, we should look at the downtown zoning and other categories to make these sorts of approvals bi-rights, in particular in neighborhoods that already have a lot of them.  high-rises oriented towards students, for example, like the Southview Forest Corridor.

To be honest with you guys, I'm not actually a big fan of this PUD. 98 vehicle parking spaces, it seems excessive and providing more subsidized parking is really quite contrary to the city's climate and sustainability goals. 650% maximum floor area ratio, that is a pit stop.  We should be seeing 3,000 to 5,000 percent max FAR. And only 12 stories? Is that all? This area needs more buildings like the nearby University Towers, which is 18 stories tall. Or perhaps this should be the site of Ann Arbor's very next Tower Plaza. I could go on, but I think this indicates my displeasure with this.  But when I studied engineering, one of the most important things I learned about was trade-offs. And in this particular case, I think that the only thing that could be worse than approving this PUD would be not approving it. I agree with many others who have said that PUDs are bad workarounds to the current zoning. In my professional field of software development, this is called a codesmith.  This PUD is an indicator not just of problems at this site, but that our zoning as a whole is bad and needs fixing, and we need to be doing that. But we cannot afford the steep cost of waiting until a new comprehensive plan before allowing this PUD through. We need to keep moving forward  with what we have while we're working on what will come next. We're in a housing crisis and the less housing we allow as a city, the more we as a city are choosing to take housing away from people.  Perhaps those who have spoken out tonight in opposition to this PUD would be willing to chip in to replace the $4.7 million of money that denial of this PUD would deny to our affordable housing fund. Or maybe they'd be willing to open their own houses to replace the 631 additional bedrooms that would be lost if we don't approve this PUD.  approve this PUD now and improve the comprehensive plan so that these sorts of developments can be by right in future.

So this is related to the site plan of this building. I, Scott Trudeau, again, this building that has 733 bedrooms in it. So some previous public commenters  asked some good questions like, who do you all represent? Who is this building for? Who is the city for? And yes, the 733 bedrooms in this building would probably be mostly occupied by wealthy students that are attending the University of Michigan. And so if you say no to this development, you're saying no to those 733 homes, where will those 733 wealthy students go?  As our friend Ottawa County Joe pointed out, people have to live somewhere. And if you don't build the housing that they want to live in where they want to live, they'll live somewhere else. Are those 733 students going to decide, never mind.  University of Michigan is one of the best schools in the country. Maybe it was really hard to get into, but they didn't build this apartment building, so I'm not gonna come here. Of course not. They're gonna find the next best option, and then where do the people who would otherwise be living in those apartments go? And so on. So by saying no to this, we're excluding 733 people from our community that would wanna live here.  I mean, that's just the reality of how the musical chairs of the market goes. And we are also saying no to millions of dollars of affordable housing funding. Now, as Adam Goodman pointed out, that is not only the $5 million, but also the tax money over time.  that will support all kinds of things. What hasn't been pointed out is that money is always leveraged with other grants and funding sources. So every dollar we bring in that's unconditional like this into our fund, we can leverage multiple times over again. So it's not $5 million, it's $25 million or more.  that can be put to good use in all of the ambitious projects that we have lined up. So we'd be saying no to those people. And we'll be saying no to the people who come here looking for housing and because 730 students came looking for somewhere to live are taking the place that they might have otherwise taken. I'm sorry, there's no room for you here.  And so yeah, we've spent 100 years finding reasons to say no. Everyone can enthusiastically support an imaginary building that can't actually be built. 100% affordable, 100% green, passive house perfect, and two stories tall for thousands of people. It can't happen. And if we demand things that can't happen, we get nothing. And if we get nothing, we know what the outcome is. What was the other thing?  Yeah, so lastly, I'll just say that somebody asked, what about if it was next to my home? I live in a very similar neighborhood. I live in a 1904 house. And I say, yes, please build a high rise in my neighborhood. I'm sure many student renters who live here would love it.

Are you going to ignore those people who we as a city pay to evaluate things like this and simply just approve this? And as they said, approve the many more like it they have planned.  You are talking about a domino effect that when this goes up, you might as well just go ahead and just roll out the red carpet for developers as opposed to asking them to do what's right, which is to go and buy the properties that are in the locations that are already zoned.  for a building like this that would address the housing crisis, to acknowledge that as I walked through that neighborhood today, there are already buildings being built in that neighborhood that will help address the housing crisis. It's not about whether or not we need it. It's just the question of, can we just go up and build these anywhere? Could we go down to Burns Park and just put one vertical because we have some space there?  Could we go over to the old west side and just put a 12 story building right there? I just think there's a lot of questions about where we put our buildings. And I agree, it's a student neighborhood, but it's a student neighborhood mixed with single family. It's part of the unique character of Ann Arbor. And the question is, do you want to fundamentally change that? Do you want to change the university and the city's unique relationship?  I employ a lot of students. I'm a university faculty. I love our students. I care about our students. However, the idea that we should just willy-nilly put buildings anywhere because we need more housing for students, and the idea that a single housing unit is going to somehow solve all of the trickle-down effect,  It is just false. I do think you could build a building that would be tall, maybe even slightly taller than the one that's there, but a true step down, and truly incorporate affordable housing. My father spent his career in tax-accredited affordable housing. I understand this space better than most outside of that space, and I can say with great certainty, if we did that, that would be a positive, and I would be very supportive of it.

It's under a thousand bedrooms. That's woefully insufficient. It's six floors shorter than the nearby University Tower. It is less than a 10x FAR. There is too much parking for cars, and there's not enough parking for bikes.  You know what's actually worse than this bad side plan? The lies that people have been telling here in opposition to it. Especially since the very resolution we are discussing just makes the lies incredibly obvious.  Oh, the site is going to be 100% powered by DTE, they say. The site plan literally includes 100 kilowatts of solar panels. My 1,000 square foot house, which is a much less energy efficient type of building than this will be, needs four kilowatts of solar panels  fully make up for my energy consumption. So this will be covering at least 25 units, probably far more just with the solar from that.  Oh, we're putting it up willy-nilly. What are you talking about? We've gone through process after process after process discussing this every step of the way. So come on, if you're opposed to this, fine. But be opposed to it for good reasons. Don't lie. Please, people.  You don't have to sink to that level. Let's talk about reality, not fantasy. And while we're talking about reality, let's talk about the fact that we need to fix the overall zoning and the comprehensive plan  because the PUDs will continue until the zoning improves.

Dot, dot, dot. It would prohibit any sort of transitional zoning or scale against the residential neighborhood to the south and east. Those comments mean or ask us to consider thoughtfully two things, the relationship of a building of this scale to its surrounding context, and whether the project provides sufficient public benefits to offset its scale.  I'm going to speak very quickly about the public benefits. These are all in the supplemental regulations. It means they are part of the zoning and they must be provided. There are affordability elements. The PUD regulations require a minimum of 15% of the total units  to be dedicated as affordable or a contribution in lieu of units, which is usually preferred by Jennifer Hall of the Ann Arbor Housing Commission. The petitioner then is required to pay $4.6 million, but has added to that a voluntary top-up of $98,000, which brings the total cash-in-lieu payment to $4.7 million, which can be leveraged up to as much to $25 to $1.  In addition to the $98,000 top-up contribution, the project will make a voluntary contribution of $50,000 to the Ann Arbor Housing Development Corporation to use for sustainability upgrades to existing or proposed AAHDC properties located in the central area of the city.  So the required 4.6 million will benefit the public, but should it count as a public benefit for purposes of justifying the zoning category for this project? And do we need other public benefits for that? There are other public benefits. I will go quickly, as quickly until I get caught up through the sustainability benefits.  The project offers a shelter-in-place community space for renters. Its generator is sized to heat common spaces. The site is located next door to an urban forest fragment.

And the amount was $25 were leveraged for every dollar that was contributed to that fund, which has primarily been from developers, but also the city has historically put general funds into the affordable housing fund. We haven't had much contributed in the last few years. So,  I would suspect that if I did a new analysis with new funding coming in, that dollar leverage would be less than 1 to 25, just because of the increased housing costs.

A month ago when this came up the first time I spoke about my experience as a student living in University Towers on South University. In 2005 when I lived there, there were 39,533 total students enrolled at U of M. Last academic year there were 51,225 total students enrolled at U of M.  While the university must bear some responsibility for this problem, the reality remains that whether we like it or not, we do in fact need more housing.  As we've heard multiple times tonight, this project, the proposed project, would bring 228 new units, 733 new bedrooms to the area. There are other considerable benefits, the 26 new EV charging stations, storage for nearly 200 bikes, including two e-bike charging stations, options for ground floor retail, LEED silver, which admittedly could be improved, as we've talked about before.  but an all-electric building with no natural gas hookups, except to support a backup emergency generator, and $4.7 million to our affordable housing fund, which we just heard from Ms. Hall about how she is able to take that money and leverage it into significantly more units of affordable housing than what the developer could build in this project for the same amount of money.  You know, we heard tonight about concerns that high density, that with the growing student population, that high density housing could continue to impact nearby neighborhoods. But the reality is our housing crisis is already impacting our near campus neighborhoods.  As I mentioned at the last meeting when I was out on the campaign trail, specifically in this area, I heard from long-term residents about concerns with housing availability due to more and more houses being gobbled up by landlords to use for shorter-term student rentals, driving up housing costs, and impacting long-term upkeep and quality of the structures. This problem exists exactly because we as a city, and yes, the university, have not kept up with the need for more student-focused housing near campus.  For all of these reasons, I will be supporting rezoning tonight because this is exactly where, within a couple of blocks from campus, we need more student housing if we don't want more student housing proliferating out into nearby neighborhoods.

We also, as Council Member Rodina stated, must acknowledge that despite the many benefits that U of M provides our community, the university's exponential growth of staff, students, and others has significantly contributed to our housing crisis. We simply do not have enough housing supply to meet demand. This project is in alignment with our climate action goals, our goals to make housing more affordable in our city, to be a more welcoming and equitable community,  And, as Jennifer Hall stated, it will provide funds to build more affordable housing. And, very importantly, it will provide an opportunity to create a more accessible, walkable, and bikeable neighborhood. The Brookings Institute found last year that removing zoning barriers and increasing housing density has positive effects on rent stabilization, especially in areas with constrained housing supply. This will help to fight our housing crisis.  And the U.S. Energy Information Administration reports that carbon emissions in cities with higher density are less than in more remote suburbs. This is very, very helpful in regards to the climate crisis. We're at a critical point in our climate crisis fight. We're predicted to be a state that's going to have a mass number of climate refugees. We need to make choices to make more housing available or it's going to impact all of us.

A lot of what I wanted to say has been said, so I won't repeat some of those points. But I did want to acknowledge staff's thoughtful professional analysis and perspective on this PUD, while also acknowledging that it was very different from where Planning Commission landed. Like Councilmember Rodino, I lived in this area of town when I first moved to Ann Arbor in 2003, so I'm very familiar with its area.  It's convenience as a location for students to live, as well as how it abuts against single-family homes. You know, I guess I wanted... Councilmember Rodinez spoke about the growth in our enrollment in the time that he's lived here. I wanted to speak more recently to the amount of students that have been added in recent years. So, 4,500 students.  only 1,000 new on-campus student housing units have been built in recent years. Private development has added approximately 2,000 new units. So in other words, we are short of housing. Our rental vacancy rate is essentially zero. Rents continue to climb. U of M enrollment continues to grow at approximately 2% a year or about a thousand students.  So this development would add 733 bedrooms. You know, student enrollment's growing by 1,000 a year. So I just want to put that in perspective. This isn't going to fill a need by itself, but it certainly is part of the solution. I think for this PUD, we're being asked, you know, to consider how it would be advantageous to the city.  And that's a value judgment. So here is mine. Housing fund, the amount is significant. I think we just heard about how those funds can be leveraged in a better way by giving the money to the housing commission rather than building units in this building.  all electric, LEED Silver certified, thermal bridging to increase efficiency of the building envelope, and last but certainly not least, bringing desperately needed housing close to campus, other developments of its kind, amenities, and transportation lines. That's enough for me to say it's advantageous to the city.  When I hear words like protect, character, preserve, maintain, infringe, financial impact, property owners, I am really concerned that they're indicative of values that prioritize keeping things like they are rather than meeting this community's very real housing needs next to campus that continues to grow.

So, to add to more numbers,  U of M has built just two dorms in the past 30 years, North Quad and Munger, and those added about 1,000 new beds. In the same time period, if my calculations are correct, they've added 15,000 more students. Now, we've talked about how much the private market has added as well in terms of new beds. Now, U of M is trying to rectify this decision to some degree, and they did this by  deciding to build a new dorm near Elbel Field, and they're doing that by acquiring private property that's currently contributing to our tax base and taking it off the tax rolls. Obviously, it'll provide much-needed new housing, but it's also going to cause other difficulties for our city, and we as a policymaking body do need to take this into account.  I understand the concerns of neighbors and and also staff who are rightfully looking at our current but outdated plans The consolidated land use element of the city's master plan was adopted over a decade ago, but this plan And while it's been reviewed, it's basically it was built upon recommendations that came  mostly about 30 years ago. The central area plan that informed that is a 1992 central area plan. The reality is our plans are very outdated, which is why we're going through a comprehensive update right now. But we are stuck at this moment of time where we have an outdated plan.  Significant housing scarcity and we were presented with a project That helps to address this Now it's important. You know, we have to identify as a body whether or not this truly has the community benefits that justifies a pretty large ask for our community and so each of us is individually having to decide that and that's difficult to do especially in the face of recommendations from our staff, but  Looking at this myself. Yeah, I'm looking at the 733 new bedrooms Primarily for U of M housing, which we know we need the 4.7 million dollars for affordable housing It's not going to be built on site, but that will be leveraged to help folks in our community it's going to be the first all-electric high-rise in the city and  It is incorporating elements of passive house building. And it's going to increase the tax base by 30 times.  Which will help fund our critical our general fund which also funds basic services for our city So these are the calculations that I need to make Recognizing that it's maybe not a perfect project and there's maybe not a perfect answer here But these are the issues that we're wrestling with as a community So I'll be voting in favor of that further discussion councilmember dish", "start": 12975.825, "end": 13160.813, "Transition": "\"\"", "Meeting Section": "Other", "Speaker Role": "Other", "is_public_comment": 0, "is_public_hearing": 0, "is_comment_start_trigger": 0, "is_comment_end_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_start_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_end_trigger": 0}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_11", "text": "It's always terrific to hear my colleagues deliberate.

And so it will be great if this building manages to do it because it will be an example that we can point to on Planning Commission and Council  and say, yes, it can be done if you had the right incentives to do it. And so I think that that's valuable. OSI has pointed out that this building may be Ann Arbor's first high-rise electric building, but it won't be one of the first nationally.  Michigan state law makes it more difficult to build this kind of building here. So I think that we value this.

Alexis DeLeo, Planning Department.  We've had a question with two parts. The first part is what was the change to increase units without increasing the basic footprint and volume represent apologize. What does the change represent Is it because the developer change their mind and about what to offer.  We know that the developer offered the planned condominium units in this building B for presale for some period of time, but did not get enough potential owners to meet their own criteria and chose to change from an ownership format to a rental format. That change alone does not trigger the need to change zoning.  that is outside of the parameters of site plan approval. And then the applicant has told us directly that the apartment units necessarily have a smaller floor areas than do the condos, and that they are striving to adhere to the physical parameters approved for building B in keeping with the spirit of the rezoning. And so that's why they have a virtually identical building mass in terms of absolute floor area, setbacks in height, and the same architectural design.  Other than the changed shape and the increase in unit count, the proposed changes to the site plan pertain to floodplain mitigation and parking reduction, and that comes specifically from the different first floor design, going from a podium shape to a U shape. The second part of the question was, what gets reported in a transportation impact analysis, and what are the potential outcomes of that analysis?  This answer response has been provided primarily from our transportation staff, and they say that multimodal transportation impact analyses determine how the transportation system is currently operating, identify any concerns with the current transportation system, and develop an understanding of how the transportation network will be impacted by or appropriately serve the new development.  The multimodal transportation study investigates all modes of travel for quality, level of service, as well as safety operations as identified in the ITE manual, that's the Institute for Traffic Engineers. Potential findings include, not limited to, the vehicle level of service is or is not affected, sidewalk gaps that impede the ability to travel to and from the site as a pedestrian,  Transit stops that are or are not ADA accessible, bicycle and pedestrian quality level of service is currently below desired levels, if so, and the impacts the proposed development will have on the safety performance or outcomes of an intersection or corridor, which is especially critical at locations identified as already having safety needs by the A2 moving together plan.  Generally, transportation staff say they do not have major concerns with this site, but would like to answer multimodal and safety questions. For example, there are new signals in the area, as well as a new roundabout, which are different than when the project was initially presented. Operational evaluation was requested and would ideally have been presented during staff review.  Although vehicular impact is not expected to change, this project did not update impacts to the non-motorized travel, transit, or safety measures, those components of the traffic impact study. The original TIA traffic impact analysis was produced before our local safety plan was produced, so there is not recognition about tiered safety locations.  And finally, I do want to mention that planning staff acknowledge the transportation team has recommended denial of the project as the applicant didn't provide the multimodal traffic analysis of the project, instead relying on the vehicular traffic analysis model from the original site plan.  But the planning team is recommending approval of the site plan regardless, as we would not have been able to conclude that any outcome of the non-motorized analysis would impact level of service standards identified in the Unified Development Code, which is the lone standard for approval or denial of a traffic impact analysis.

Today, just a day after our city celebrated Juneteenth, I want to underscore a topic that has been long tied with our shared history and the concerns of those doing business, visiting, and living in the city of Ann Arbor. The lineage of American policing finds its origin in an institution we have spent centuries trying to overcome, slavery.  Historically, slave patrols in the antebellum South bore the responsibility of apprehending runaway slaves and thwarting potential revolts. After the Civil War, these patrols simply donned a new name, transforming into what we recognize today as formal police departments. It is crucial to remember that this metamorphosis was not without consequence.  The patrol's legacy lingered, perpetuating disproportionate targeting and control over black people. Why did this happen? Primarily two reasons stand out. The abolition of slavery was not synonymous with the eradication of white supremacy. Several white southerners were intent on retaining their dominance over black people. And they saw the emerging police departments as instrumental in achieving this.  Moreover, these departments were deemed necessary to restore order in the post-war South, which was grappling with chaos and instability. This unsettling historical legacy manifests itself in our contemporary policing practices across the nation, and not just in the South. As evidenced by current events, Federal Department of Justice civil rights investigation findings and their subsequent consent decrees  Black people are disproportionately more likely to be stopped, searched, arrested, and tragically, fatally shot by the police. These statistics stem from the historical context of policing, which has been about control, especially over black and brown communities. We know that the history of American policing is not a relic of the past, but an ongoing narrative that we must actively shape.  The vestiges of white supremacy remain embedded in our police forces, and black and brown people continue to be disproportionately targeted. This is why I am introducing an ordinance to end low-level secondary traffic stops as one of many crucial steps towards creating a police system that is truly equitable, just, and fair for all members of our community.

Um, we've talked a lot about, you know, the statistics that secondary traffic stops lack public safety benefit. That's something I do want to stress, but do cause harm, humiliate and expose communities of color to risk of violence as well as criminal criminalized poverty. Um, they also decrease perceptions of safety in the community and decreased community trust in the police.  I believe that we need other ways that we can provide assistance and resources to those who are having obstacles and driving safely. I also want to make a note that this ordinance is really an intersectional equity issue. This is also a disability issue. Those who are pulled over by police are disproportionately people with disabilities, in part because disability is overrepresented among communities of color.  43% of disabled people are arrested by the time they turn 28. 30 to 50% of people subjected to police use of force are people with disabilities. 33 to 50% of people killed by police are people with disabilities.  So the risk of this, obviously, and of being subjected to police violence increases as these identities intersect with race, class, gender, and LGBTQ status. So this approach to eliminate secondary stops is not just anti-racist, but anti-ableist, community-centered, and an equitable way that we need to approach our policing.

Thank you, Councilmember Harris. Harrison, so certainly the work that's gone into this is very notable. The the outpouring of support that we've heard from the community is is also incredible. It is something that we can hear  very clearly from our community members that this is the direction that we want to go in our community, and it's important. Many of my council members' colleagues have spoken to the need for this. And so that is very clear. I think to address the couple of questions that I've gotten from residents  around making these changes. I think it's important to note that there are, of course, reasons at times that one might want to have enforcement around these issues. And these ordinance changes don't prevent that from happening. A ticket can be mailed to a resident or to a driver, I should say.  who has one of these violations. And that's important to note because at times there are reasons we might want to enforce this. But there is no reason that we need to stop a driver for any of these issues. They are not issues that can be changed at the moment. They are not safety issues. And so I think we are definitely heading the right direction in terms of how we are changing our enforcement so that we can make sure that everybody is safe.  We have heard from former law enforcement officer about how that improves the safety of Police officers and we've heard loud and clear from the community how this can impact the safety of drivers Further discussion councilmember Harrison", "start": 14622.118, "end": 14736.639, "Transition": "\"\"", "Meeting Section": "Other", "Speaker Role": "Other", "is_public_comment": 0, "is_public_hearing": 0, "is_comment_start_trigger": 0, "is_comment_end_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_start_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_end_trigger": 0}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_18", "text": "Thank you, Mayor Taylor. I have a few more words about this. I just wanted to add that we must acknowledge the fear, stress, and trauma black and brown communities face when loved ones are simply out driving. This fear isn't abstract or unfounded. It's grounded in a history of racial profiling, discrimination, and a disproportionate number of police violence incidents towards black people. The trauma associated with this fear is immense.  Mothers may find themselves in a state of perpetual anxiety, always worrying about their children. This constant fear can lead to conditions like chronic anxiety, depression, and even PTSD. Black children, teenagers, and adults who experience these police stops live with this trauma. Many have grown to associate driving with fear and stress rather than freedom and independence.  Every police stop, no matter how routine or minor, carries the risk of escalating into a dangerous or life-threatening situation that violates someone's civil and human rights. Additionally, the financial burden of these low-level stops can be significant. Fines and fees associated with traffic violations or other low-level secondary traffic stops can lead to financial stress.  especially for families already economically challenged. The added cost of legal representation or the burden of navigating complex legal systems without it can quickly accumulate. As we consider this ordinance, we must keep in mind the layers of fear, trauma, and financial burden associated with these low-level secondary traffic stops.  Let us acknowledge the reality of living with this fear and work towards the reform that not only respects the comfort of all of our residents, but also supports the needs of our economically disadvantaged community members. In prohibiting low-level secondary traffic stops, we take one step closer to making our city a place where all residents can live without fear and with dignity. And I need to quickly add that in rereading Section E in preparation for the first reading, I would like to move to amend the language for greater clarity  And because the current language does not fully reflect my intention with respect to tail lamps. So, am I doing this right? Please, you're doing it. So to clarify section E, I would like to amend it to read the following.

It's incredibly important that we, as a municipal government, assure our residents that our law enforcement focus is always the promotion of public safety, performed with professionalism, without bias or favor.  The secondary stops addressed by this ordinance are not necessary to affect public safety. Crucially, however, they unnecessarily disrupt the lives of community members.

Household items are appliances, bikes, kitchen gadgets, garden tools, etc. must be in good condition. They can be placed near the curb for no more than 48 continuous hours.

They may not be placed in the roadway, sidewalk, or other path of travel. They may not create a vision or physical obstruction for pedestrians, vehicle operators, or bicyclists. And they must be clearly labeled that they are intended for donation or reuse. So really, this ordinance just puts and makes legal what many of us already do. And I want to thank Ward 5 neighbor who brought this to our attention after they were actually fined for doing this and kind of scratched their head to wonder why.

I agree that it's really important that we not ticket people for behavior that we seek to promote as part of our A20 plan, particularly strategy five, the circular economy strategy that seeks to promote reuse, repair, regeneration of material resources through activities such as swapping, donation, and more. So I think about this as the pop-up thrift stores ordinance.  And though I co-sponsor I would like to propose an amendment. Ms. Beaudry. I sent it to you earlier Do you need me to send it again? No, will you please circulate it and I'll read it. Thank you so to section 2 colon 13 1 a  It currently reads that items can be placed for no more than 48 continuous hours.

A, household items must be  placed near the curb starting at noon Fridays and must be removed by Sunday by 5 p.m. after 53 hours. A person may only place household items, etc., etc., etc.  So the major change here, and Attorney Reiser has dubbed it, there's the floating 48 version and there's the weekend edition version. And I'm advocating for the weekend edition version. So we need to move something, right? So I move that. You have moved it. Is there a second? Yeah.  Seconded by Councilor Dino. Thank you counselor. Yeah, and then I'll just finish saying that I do this for two reasons one is I think that pop-up thrift stores would be more useful to those who want to shop there if you knew when they would happen you won't know where they will happen, but at least you know when and  They will happen. And second, we received some fairly strongly worded concerns from both Solid Waste staff and Community Standards staff, both of whom will be charged with implementing this ordinance. And Community Standards is concerned that they will receive a neighbor's complaint call about things on the curb. And in the floating 48 version, it'll be, there's no way for Community Standards to know how long the items have been out there. And so they're going to get pressure  from both sides of the conversation, both the person who complains about the stuff and the person who put it out and will say, it's only been there five minutes. And Sarah Mason, the solid waste and circular economy sort of head,  believes that a better approach would be to have the swap option available during a defined period, not only because it will make enforcement more straightforward, but it makes promoting the program as part of A20 easier. The idea is to give people new ways to shop, and so I  Scheduling this thing during a defined time period could make it easier for it to become an event. We would know, hey, weekend, I'm going to go for a walk and go for a curbside shopping spree with my friend and she can help me carry some stuff home. So putting it out there, it's, I don't, though I am friendly towards my colleagues, I don't think this is a friendly amendment.

We had just a couple questions on this item, the first being what is kind of a brief history of our engagement with the GSA on this topic. As the council will recall, there was direction from the council table to talk to the federal government about future uses for the federal building site, and in the course of those conversations, we  had more detailed conversations with them about their intention to redevelop the plaza that is in the front of the federal building. And so through the course of those conversations, we thought there might be an interesting opportunity here to partner with the GSA and envision an expanded federal plaza using either some portion or all of the right of way along the 200 block of Liberty Street.  So question two, why is this area being considered for an open street? I'll start by saying that in July there will be an item coming before the council to authorize a cost sharing agreement with the DDA for a circulation study or a sub area transportation plan for the downtown.  Part of that analysis will include looking at streets in the downtown area for open street installations or curbless streets or something like that. So the question is, why would we put a resolution forward to look at this area in front of the federal building? And the answer is, because the federal government is engaging in a design study this summer to redevelop the federal plaza.  And so the idea here is we let the subarea transportation plan for downtown move forward, the circulation study move forward, but also simultaneously engage in a process with the federal government to see what a design for such an installation would look like in front of the federal building when  These processes are underway simultaneously. When they conclude, we would bring back recommendations to the council on, you know, what we would actually do. So what this resolution directs is conversations and participation and design, but it does not actually direct the installation or removal of the right-of-way or anything like that.  So how will the community be engaged in this process? All of our projects like this in the city go through our community engagement checklist or community engagement toolbox. We will have robust engagement. I would envision discussion with downtown stakeholders, including the businesses, the merchant associations.  certainly consultation with area to moving together transportation plan which I think already answers some of the big questions about the what in terms of directionality for what the city should prioritize downtown but we would want to have more detailed conversations about the how and the when and things like that.  And then finally, what engagement is in store for the circulation study? And what is the aim of the study? Same answer on the circulation study. The A2 moving together plan has done a lot of the heavy lifting on engagement in terms of figuring out what public priorities are for the what. Engagement for the circulation study would answer on focus on the how and the when. So there will be a stakeholder committee  technical committee, there will be public communication from the consultant and you know all of that would kind of feed into a prioritization for transportation priorities downtown. And in terms of what the circulation study will cover,  The consultant, Smith Group, by the way, who also was the consultant on the A2 Moving Together plan, so they're intimately familiar with our transportation goals. They would build a downtown multimodal traffic model. They would evaluate the feasibility, conceptual plans, and costs for up to six additional bicycle infrastructure projects in the downtown.  They would create technical guidance and plan improvements for transit priority streets in the downtown, working with AAATA. There would be a study of 5th and Division, moving those two streets back to two-way traffic. And there would be feasibility for up to four pedestrian streets, shared streets, or curbless streets in the downtown area.  This resolution simply kind of puts a marker on the idea that because of the work of the federal government, we want to make sure that this concept is identified as part of the effort for our circulation study and that we don't miss opportunities to do some basic joint design work and concept work of the federal government in advance of the delivery of the circulation study.", "start": 15659.147, "end": 15972.033, "Transition": "\"\"", "Meeting Section": "Other", "Speaker Role": "Other", "is_public_comment": 0, "is_public_hearing": 0, "is_comment_start_trigger": 0, "is_comment_end_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_start_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_end_trigger": 0}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_41", "text": "Discussion of DC2?", "start": 15972.033, "end": 15972.613, "Transition": "\"\"", "Meeting Section": "Other", "Speaker Role": "Other", "is_public_comment": 0, "is_public_hearing": 0, "is_comment_start_trigger": 0, "is_comment_end_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_start_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_end_trigger": 0}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_14", "text": "Councilmember Briggs Yeah, thank you and thanks for that introduction I think that is the groundwork about why the timing is is so important for us to be doing this as Folks know we've received a fair amount of feedback from downtown merchants and Main Street Area Association regarding kind of questions and concerns around pursuing a full pedestrian plaza in this area and I  I think that the case has been laid about why we're exploring this right now.

Just my gut is that this feels like just a minute of the tail wagging the dog with regard to the federal government's intentions. Main Street Area Association, of which, you know, I serve, has been facilitating, organizing, engaging, and managing the pedestrian street closures since they started in 2020.  We know from that experience that pedestrian street closures need to be on blocks with heavy engagement from the businesses, with a number of them extending into the street. Any business that doesn't have, any space that doesn't have businesses in the street quickly becomes dead space. Half that block will close at five o'clock when the government services building closes.  The GSA just isn't a destination for visitors or citizens outside of 9 to 5. Abracadabra, Afternoon Delight, Sam's Clothing, all of those close around 5 to 6 p.m. So in my mind, this is not an attraction. The closing of this particular thoroughfare doesn't make sense to me. And generally, I am in support of closing streets and making our city more pedestrian friendly.  I think it'd be silly to not point out that one block from this proposed site, we have Liberty Plaza. And we see that being adjacent to a space that's dead outside of office hours has a negative impact on that space's vibrancy. So adding a second plaza within the block of that site doesn't make any sense to me either.  Councilmember Briggs mentioned, and I appreciate that, mentioned hearing a lot from the business community who would be impacted by this. And contrary to what we hear from the experience of Main Street Area Association members on Main Street who have experienced the street closures and see that, you know, if you go to dinner, go to a bar, you're going to go shop somewhere else, they're supportive of street closures on Main Street. The businesses that we've heard from on this particular block don't see benefit to it.  And I really worry about the city's resources to activate the space so that it's not just dead after six o'clock And if we have those resources Why aren't we using them now for Liberty Plaza and for West Park and other areas within the city that we know need to be activated?

This resolution would change that moving forward, directing our administrator to implement a process for collecting and analyzing the demographic information of all bidders for city contracts, services, or supplies, and all those who win those contracts, and to deliver an annual report to council of the findings to council.  Collecting this information and understanding who is bidding on and winning government contracts is essential to assess potential systemic and structural barriers that underserved communities and individuals may face in taking advantage of procurement and contracting opportunities. Whether additional outreach and support are needed to ensure that we have a pool of diverse, highly skilled applicants competing.  According to the Urban Institute, local governments around the country collectively spend more than $1.8 trillion annually on construction, goods, and services, and have spent equitably in support of minority and women-owned businesses. The collective impact of municipalities could improve socioeconomic outcomes and lead to stronger, more equitable communities.  Unfortunately, while the state of Michigan still significantly limits our ability to directly level the playing field in local contracting and procurement, having a better understanding of this data in the future will empower us to take action to improve community outreach, identify and dismantle systemic barriers, and improve our decision-making.

Secondly, the wonderful people who do pull over preventions can now spend that time helping their communities in other ways instead of helping the police avoid  instead of helping these people avoid the police like Sauron's eye. Has anyone ever called the cops and honestly thought they would help you find out who broke into your car? Insurance claims maybe, but not to actually solve the crime. So what makes you think that when they pull over and harass people, they say are criminals, that they're actually not just looking for an excuse to look busy?

Was it morning yet? It might be good morning to you all. I am happy that this ordinance did pass on tonight.  It is my prayer that no kinks pop up in his past in the second reading. And I, it is my prayer because in Washtenaw County, there is this claim to being so progressive. And a lot of times it turns into symbolism. And so it is my hope that this has the weight needed to enforce when officers will still try to do pretext stops on black and brown folks  As we see, Washtenaw County prosecutor on day one said no pretext stops in Washtenaw County, and that any contraband found would be thrown out. That has not happened. We have got calls from multiple families that are suffering because they're poor, because they had a life that was out. This is still happening with a law on the books that says no pretext stops.  So it is my hope that while I'm grateful this has been passed, that we have the meat needed to hold officers accountable when they do this. And that all pretext stops that have contraband or anything found are really thrown out. This is an assault against the black community. I can't even tell you as a black woman, I'm scared when I'm pulled over by the police. They come up to you with their hands on their guns. I have been treated horribly by the Ann Arbor police just  When the Black Lives Matter mural in Willard Park was destroyed and had this man totally act as if I wasn't there, as if I was invisible and treated me very horribly. This is the state of policing in America, but not just in America, right here in Ann Arbor. Number eight, elitist city, right? So we're asking that please don't just make this symbolism, but give it the meat needed to hold your officers accountable to actually follow this ordinance so that black and brown lives  can be safe in the Ann Arbor area.

My name is Stephanie Carter. I am the chair of the Ann Arbor Independent Community Oversight Police Oversight Commission. Seven years ago, to the day,  July 6th, 2016, Philando Castile was shot and killed as a result of a traffic stop. It was reported that the stop was because of a cracked taillight. It's also been reported that perhaps the stop was because of tinted windows.  I don't believe in coincidence and so I don't believe that it is on that anniversary that we are here to consider the driving equity ordinance. Nor do I think it is coincidental that this ordinance comes before you on the second reading at pretty much the same time that the EMU SMART traffic study came out.  Now, let me talk for just a second about that traffic study. As I have said before when I came before you, ICPAC plans to have a public forum at our next meeting, which will be September 26th.  that the location will be announced. We are inviting council, we're inviting all the police department, we're inviting the public, and we hope that everyone comes out, anyone who has an interest in discussing, whether it's criticizing or whatever, with regard to this report, we're interested in public input.  And then we expect that IGPAC will be discussing some of the recommendations in that traffic study. But let me just point to a couple of the conclusions from that traffic study.  They say our analysis conclusively identified significant disparities across every dimension examined with non-white motorists being stopped and searched more frequently and white motorists being stopped and searched less frequently than would be expected in every instance.  Some of the largest disparities identified in this analysis involve African American male drivers for stops initiated for equipment violations. Exactly what the ordinance addresses.  I also want to read a quote. This is a quote that the study quotes from a larger nationwide study that was done in 2020. In a related but larger scale national study analyzing traffic stop disparities, these, Pearson is the name of the examiner.  conclude that, quote, the downstream effect of traffic stops can be injurious, even if individual stop decisions are not directly affected by the color of one's skin. Similarly, enforcement of minor traffic violations, like broken taillights, even if conducted uniformly and without animus, can place heavy burdens on black and Hispanic drivers  without improving public safety. Ann Arbor is about to be on the forefront of what I think is gonna be a national movement. And across the country, folks like us are looking at doing away with what really produces unnecessary  between the police and the public. Totally unnecessary. You know, if any of you drive and you drive out of state in places where they have toll roads, you don't often see somebody sitting in those toll booths anymore collecting the toll. They take a picture of your car and then they send you your bill. This ordinance provides for that type of enforcement if it's needed for minor traffic violations.  And so, without sacrificing the public safety of those of us who live in the city of Ann Arbor and those who work in the city of Ann Arbor and come from other places, I urge you to adopt the Driving Equity Ordinance. As I say, the ICPAC plans  Once again, I can't emphasize this enough because sometimes you put something out there and you hope that people respond to it. And we're hoping that council and the public will respond by coming out September 26. We will announce a location. It probably will not be here in City Hall. And we'd like to discuss this. We'd like to have a public forum. But hopefully by that time, the driving equity ordinance will already be adopted.

Hello, my name is Rita Ross.  and I represent Earhart Village Homes Association this evening as its president. Myself and many members of our association have attended all the community meetings regarding the Earhart Road 2023 project since 2019. I have spoken and written to you about this project now for over a year. We have wanted to see production and resurfacing for many years.  Our goal was to eliminate the sidewalk gap project because it would not serve its desired purpose and still won't because significant gaps remain in front of Boxford Cemetery and between the Pine Tree Street with no plans to fill those gaps. Also, because it would infringe upon and significantly harm our property and likely seriously damage our mature trees and paintings and plantings.  We were very disappointed that it took numerous attempts to be heard by the city. We attended meetings, we made public comments, we wrote letters, but there was no response from our representative government. Our own Ward 2 council members were told not to speak with us. It was not until we hired an attorney to force a response and provide a signed petition  that we finally received some response. We should not have had to pay thousands of dollars to force a representative government to respond and to work with us. Ultimately, Nick Hutchinson and Nick Bailey did meet and collaborate with us. They listened to our concerns especially and seriously. They investigated our suggestions to move the project west or closer to the median, which may waste the sidewalk to be closer to the existing growth.  They changed the retaining wall design and configuration to limit the damage to our property, and agreed to replace, like for like, evergreen for evergreen, for any tree that needed to be removed to accommodate their design. We do still have concerns about potential traffic issues during the construction phase.  But we would like this evening to thank Nick Bailey and Nick Hutchinson for their collaboration, and we look forward to our continuing project partnership during the construction and reforestation phase of the project.

They can't vote. There's no quid pro quo there. You all took the label Democrat when you ran for office.  When the mayor and a majority of the council solicit high-rise builders and slavishly rezone properties to serve them, that's 20th century Republican behavior. When you silenced after meeting open mic last year, November, that was 21st century Republican behavior.  If you were proud of what you do, you would not fear the open mic.

This city council has stood so fiercely against any Palestinian human rights resolution for so many years.  Think about it. Think about it. A lot of these people look very much like Palestinians. If they're going to treat Palestinians that way, how do you think they're going to treat you? How do you think they're going to treat you?

This is the kind of racist bastard of a city council that we're faced with. Again, if they think Palestinians are so disposable, so murderable,  What do you think they think about you? What do you think they think about you? Unfortunately, whenever we bring up Palestinian human rights, the city council gets up on their chair and screams about the Holocaust in Europe, which happened. It ended in 1945.  And this council uses the Holocaust as a weapon against the Palestinian people to help Israel kill more Palestinians. Whenever we mention Palestinian human rights, they jump up on their chair and scream anti-Semitism as a weapon against the Palestinian people.  Even Watson and Song were practically crying like a baby over the sufferings of the Holocaust. Well, God damn it, it ended almost 80 years ago. Think about what you're doing now.

I'm here again because I am going to run a campaign and replace this lady, Jen Eyre, who is racist and she has accepted money from friends of Israel Defense Forces. Israel Defense Forces are a terrorist organization that murder children, elderly, anyone they can get their hands on.  Israel has done everything, everything under the sun. Murdered toddlers, killed reporters, uprooted people from their homes. And the United States pays for these atrocities by spending billions of dollars each year from our taxes.  We've been asking for 20 years that this body of people discuss we are against military aid to Israel. They never have. I don't know what else Israel has to do for this bunch of white people to decide it is enough.  A two-year-old was killed on the same day that Ms. Song here and Mr. Watson here were crying over how much they love Israel and their friends and this and that. At the same time that Israel had murdered a two-year-old, they were saying stuff to bring us images of people in concentration camps.  People who stand against Israel and say no more murder of Palestinians are not for murder of other people. In fact, we stand against all of that, have spoken against all of that all of our lives. Shame on you to want to confuse people with that.  Also, thank you for passing this ordinance on driving equity, but please, is that enough? Is that all you can do for black people in this country? Consider $97 trillion that you white people, all blacks,  You know why you owe them? Because you extracted free labor from them hundreds of years and you piled it up and you became the rich people that you are today. Without them and without the land that you stole from red people, from native people, you would not be sitting where you're sitting.  Start thinking about giving it back, and it's 97 trillion. Did you hear me, Mr. Mayor? It's $97 trillion that you white people owe black people. Start doing it, and stop squeezing black people out of this town. Your policies have made this town more segregated than ever before. You are racist against blacks, and you are racist against Palestinians.  And this country cannot stand that anymore.

At the core of this resolution is the belief that all citizens, regardless of their past, deserve an opportunity to rebuild their lives and fully reintegrate into society. The mission is to break the cycle of recidivism, reduce social inequality, and address the systemic issues that often lead individuals into the criminal legal system in the first place.  Many tenant-based voucher holders have had interactions with the criminal legal system. The trauma associated with these experiences often presents significant obstacles to social reintegration, employment, and housing stability. By providing trauma-informed supportive services, we can address these barriers and help affected individuals begin their journey towards recovery and stability.  The marijuana excise tax revenue offers a substantial resource that can directly benefit these individuals. As many of you know, the legal marijuana industry was born out of a recognition that criminal penalties for marijuana usage disproportionately affected certain communities, contributing to cycles of poverty, crime, and disenfranchisement.  Thus, it's both fitting and redemptive that the financial gains from this industry are used to help heal the wounds inflicted by the very system it represents a departure from. This is not merely an investment in those impacted by the criminal legal system, but an investment in our communities, our shared values, and our collective future.  We believe in second chances, in the potential for change, and in the power of supportive services to heal and restore.

This is going to really advance our efforts to build out multimodal transportation, including building out connections that extend an all-ages, all-abilities bike network, improve the safety of people riding, biking, and walking,  well as supporting the long-range plans of our bus system and You know one thing I wanted to mention is that the proposal that's in front of us is really rooted in our comprehensive transportation plan It focuses on how we can make street improvements create like a low-stress bike network as I mentioned look at shared street possibilities and pedestrian malls and update signals for the safety of people biking and walking and  It also identifies a couple of key areas that are in need of rethinking in order to support safe, active transportation. One is restoring 5th Street to a two-way road, and then assessing the reconfiguration of the really complex intersection at Beaks, Broadway, Detroit, Division, and Cary. Just the fact that I have to name that many streets that come together can tell you how scary it can be to ride through that section of town.  So, because I think our transportation goals are so important, I'm proposing an amendment that has three whereas clauses. I sent it earlier, so I think that that should arrive in your inboxes. This is to immediately follow, I think, the second whereas clause. And I will go ahead and read them.  Whereas, one of the two critical goals of the Moving Together Towards Vision Zero plan is to eliminate fatalities and serious injuries resulting from traffic crashes by 2025. Whereas, one of two critical goals of the Moving Together Towards Vision Zero plan is to transition to a carbon-neutral transportation system by 2030.

It's more than just words on the ground. They're expressions that we all need to be reminded of the value in black lives. Your officer, noticing me visibly upset, walked right past me to my Caucasian sister. And she said to him,  I didn't call you. Well, no, that's not true, because she did call after I called. But she said, this is the individual that reached out to you all first. And he came back and he had the most arrogant, nasty attitude of someone that is dealing with the public and someone that is upset, right? It was very disturbing to me.

I am asking that you all make an amendment tonight to put in that these officers must follow this ordinance. This isn't a resolution. This isn't a suggestion.

I and many of my colleagues at the School of Public Health are members of this association.  And in their policy statement, the organization urges municipal governments to, quote, advance equity and justice by decriminalizing and eliminating officer enforcement of regulations such as minor traffic violations, including expired registration and broken taillights.  among many other things that the policy statement says. I invite you to find the policy statement here at this QR code, as well as other city policies that the city can adopt to really address this issue. The American Public Health Association has made this policy recommendation based on years and years of rigorous research showing the harms of everyday policing, including traffic stops, the harms that can have on residents, especially marginalized residents.  This ordinance will also complement the unarmed response program that the city will soon be funding. Ultimately, in a safe and equitable community, the research shows that interactions between residents and police should be minimized and access to supportive services should be expanded. The driving equality ordinance will help reduce the possible pathways to jail or prison and the unarmed response program will help increase supportive services for those in need.  The synergy of these two initiatives will lead to not just better public safety, but a community where there are better opportunities for all members to thrive. In public health, we try to prevent things before they're happening, and this driving a quality ordinance.  will help prevent discrimination, prevent the potential for police violence, and also prevent pathways to jails and prisons. I urge you to align our city with this research on the issue and pass the ordinance as a starting point to address these issues.

My name is Aiden Kingwell. I have lived in the City of Ann Arbor for almost six years now.

But I wanted to come forward in my capacity as an engineer, as someone who has received training in mathematics and particularly statistics to speak on this issue.  We know that racism, and in particular pretextual racism in terms of both traffic stops and stops while black people are simply walking, while are simply shopping, while are simply going about their daily lives, are mathematically demonstrable. This is something which is proven.  I think that, as many people have said before me, this is an excellent first step, but we also need to take a statistical and sane and racially equitable approach to examining other issues that involve escalation from a minor infraction, which, as we have discussed previously, may not even warrant criminal punishment whatsoever.  and escalate that into a much larger issue. As I said, these are issues that are not only affecting members of the community, especially people of colour, while they are driving. It affects them while they are going about their daily business. And I think we need to examine this issue in the broader context of the protections to the community that are brought by enforcing these principles versus the damage to the community, including escalation to use of force and potentially even death, in a broader context than just that which relates to motor vehicles.

I served in law enforcement for 10 years, so speaking on that perspective, I agree with a lot of comments that my colleagues have made. Thank you, Cynthia Harrison, and really all of city council for the work that you've done on this. Traffic stops are dangerous. We made a decision in this country long ago to use the police for literally almost everything under the sun when it comes to safety.  Traffic stops, when you're on the roadway as an officer, you can get hit. All kinds of things can happen. And then you're causing trauma for the people when you pull them over. No one likes getting pulled over. I think the majority of people in this room, when they get pulled over, their anxiety is going to go up. They're going to feel uncomfortable. And then for people that are in the black and brown community, there's a heightened fear that you might not live on that traffic stop.  When I was an officer, it was very hard for me to understand that when I first started, when I was talking to my friends. Because I thought, well, I'm just pulling you over for speeding, or I'm just pulling you over to remind you that you have a headlight out. And it took a long time in this career to really understand for my friends that we need to be more aware of the presence that we bring to people.  When we walk into rooms, when we are sitting at the park in the patrol car, when we pull people over, we can cause stress and anxiety. And there's traffic stops that I've done and I've seen how scared people were on those stops.  And so when there's situations where we can avoid those stops, we should do it. And shout out to Pullover Prevention. They've been doing a lot of work with fixing cars so people don't have to risk being stopped for these really low-level offenses.  If we started traffic stop policies right now, I don't think we would have the police stopping people for these extremely minor infractions. And so this ordinance is a step in the right direction. And we really have to do more to restructure traffic enforcement because we know that traffic stops kill people, they injure people.  And at the end of the day, safety needs to be the primary concern, not using the police in a way that they really have other things that they could be doing that would be a lot more beneficial than pulling people over for things like a crack in the windshield or loud exhaust or poverty-related things when you're driving a car.  And so I want to thank you all again. I really appreciate the process and all the collaboration. This has brought a lot of people together. And I'll rescind my time. Thanks.

My name is Marta Nelson, and I'm the Director of Government Strategy for the Vera Institute of Justice. Vera works to end mass incarceration, protect immigrants' rights, and build safe, thriving communities. Vera is leading a cohort of 10 cities and counties from across the country who are interested in improving traffic safety and reducing racial disparities in traffic enforcement. Councilmember Harrison is part of this learning community.  Backed by the evidence, cities from Philadelphia to Memphis, states from Virginia to Oregon have enacted policies that remove police from enforcement of non-safety-related stops. By various counts, at least 12 jurisdictions nationwide have passed such policies, while at least 10 have done so by police order and four by prosecutorial policy. Extensive research shows that these policies provide four key benefits.  First, research shows that policies like the Driving Equality Ordinance improve traffic safety by focusing police stops on unsafe driving behavior. Second, ending non-safety-related stops can promote public safety and community trust, as the frequency of these stops compounds distrust in government institutions such as police departments and prosecutor's offices, which depend on the public's cooperation to solve crime.  Third, these policies bear more drivers of the physical, psychological, and economic harms caused by traffic stops. And fourth, these policies reduce harmful racial disparities. As we have heard tonight about the recent report in Ann Arbor, that found significant racial disparities across the board, but particularly for equipment violations. And the findings in Ann Arbor are consistent with research nationwide  finding greater disparities in non-safety-related stops than in safety-related stops. Eliminating these stops worked. After Philadelphia instituted its policy on low-level stops, traffic stops involving Black men went down 54%. Now, opponents of these policies tend to argue that they're necessary for fighting crime and keeping the roads safe, both of which are unsupported by evidence. Regarding public safety, these stops rarely result in the recovery of guns or other contraband.  A national study found that the police recovered guns in fewer than 1% of non-safety-related stops, while another study found that the eight largest California police departments recovered guns in just 0.5% of all traffic stops. And regarding road safety, banning low-level stops does not prohibit police from making traffic stops due to more serious equipment violations, like two missing headlights or anything causing visibly reckless driving.  A Connecticut analysis found that the equipment violations in forced and low-level stops do not contribute to accidents. Finally, polling shows that policies like the Driving Quality Orders have strong bipartisan vote support. Voters clearly understand that there are better ways to handle these issues, as do members of Ann Arbor who are considering this initiative. So I urge you to vote for them.

In addition to all of the insightful testimony that you've heard here tonight and all of the elements that are listed in the findings section of the proposed ordinance, I'd also like to emphasize that people with mental illness are also disproportionately represented in the criminal legal system and black people with mental illness even more so.  According to NAMI Michigan, about one in four people with a serious mental illness have been arrested by the police at some point in their lifetime. And about two in five adults in jail or prison have a history of mental illness. Jail is not the right place for these folks to end up. If we stop picking up people for non-criminal activities and stop them from entering the prison pipeline,  We not only work to reduce the racial inequity in our community, as you've heard all throughout the evening, but we can also work towards getting people with mental health conditions the medical and social services they need rather than continuing to fill our jail.

By passing this ordinance, we are communicating to people across the nation who have feared or suffered the consequences of low-level secondary traffic stops that Ann Arbor welcomes you. We are saying that as a City Council, we understand that these stops have long incited fear, tension, and sadly, have even cost lives and communities.  At the first reading, we grappled with the weight of American policing's history and trauma, underscoring the need for transformative change. We heard heartbreaking narratives from Ann Arbor residents and visitors about their encounters with police during these stops. These were stark reminders of the pressing need to reform how law enforcement interacts with those they protect.  I'd like to extend my appreciation to the Ann Arbor Police Department for understanding that this is not an indictment on their profession, but a stride towards healing historical harm and fostering trust within our community. I and the rest of the community appreciate your diligence and commitment to keeping our city safe. Let's not overlook that this ordinance also serves as a protective measure for our officers.  Over the last decade, traffic fatalities have been one of the leading causes of officer deaths nationwide. By curtailing unnecessary traffic stops, we can reduce this risk. The Driving Equality Ordinance is all about safety. This ordinance plays an essential part in achieving our city's Vision Zero goals. It aims to enhance road safety for everyone in Ann Arbor, be they drivers, cyclists, or pedestrians.  We've seen commendable progress in reducing car accidents over the last five years, yet over 2,500 accidents a year and 17 fatal and incapacitating injury crashes in 2021, there is still much work to do. By eliminating these low-level stops, we can redirect our police resources to tackling serious traffic offenses, making our roads safer.  Furthermore, it seeks to create a safer environment for our black and brown drivers who have been traumatized by nationwide police violence. A recent report shows that non-white drivers in Ann Arbor are stopped and searched more frequently than white drivers. No black person in America can escape the fear and trauma of traffic stops. As a black mother, I know this trauma all too well.  Every black parent has to have the talk with their children about how to survive a traffic stop. The resulting long-term physical and psychological harm is well documented in academic research. And I would like, at this point, to make an amendment that I've circulated with Clerk Baldry.

Thank you to Councilmember Harrison for all her work on this. I'd like to be added as a co-sponsor and I'd like to just add a couple personal notes. It's hard not to sit here and think about family, especially when I recognize so many people that were sitting out here and spoke earlier today.  You know, my mom was raised black in Detroit, and my dad was raised black in Mount Vernon, New York, and they both chose to move to Ann Arbor shortly after I was born because it would be a better place to raise their black son. Their upbringings gave them no illusions about the risk for black men growing up anywhere in America, but they thought that by teaching me  they could help alleviate some of the worries that we've all talked about today, about police stops and what to do when you're stopped. Even so, a few years ago, when I heard a pop after backing into a pole in a parking lot, my first thought was not about confirming the type of damage that occurred, but rather a silent prayer that I had not cracked my taillight, because I immediately feared the potential of being stopped for it later that night.  Luckily, I'd only cracked the plastic casing and no white light escaped from the fixture, which allowed me to breathe a sigh of relief. This is the kind of mental weight the specter of these stops causes in black and brown communities. Let's pass this ordinance tonight and lift the worries about these secondary stops from the minds of minorities and from the minds of people who simply can't afford to fix their cars. Let's also lift the task of these stops  from the plate of police officers who have larger public safety issues to deal with. As the first black man to sit around this table since Larry Hunter, who represented Ward 1, like Councilmember Harrison does, until 1997, I think it is quite poignant that Councilmember Hunter had his own direct experience with the secondary stop. He was arrested by Washtenaw County Sheriff's deputies after being a passenger in a vehicle  that was stopped for a cracked taillight in 1991, the year I was born. His Ward 1 colleague, Ann Marie Coleman, a white woman, was outraged. She was quoted in the Ann Arbor News saying, everyone reports that when they have a taillight out and they're stopped by police, they get a warning. I'm speechless that they did all they did with Mr. Chauncey and Mr. Hunter.  Mr. Hunter ended up winning his case and having his charges dropped But the question becomes if a council member who knew his rights and knew he had nothing and done nothing wrong Could still be in thrown in jail as a result of a secondary stop. How can we ensure that anyone? Will get a fair shake 32 years later this ordinance change will come too late for mr. Hunter, but I'm proud to support it tonight.

The city and the county had committed to racism as a public health crisis back in 2020. And I think during the pandemic, we kind of thought that we had health disparities, access to health services, the life expectancy differences across our zip codes, right? There is a 14-year life expectancy difference for black folks in Ann Arbor, Ypsi.  But public health is also related to public safety. The quality of life is related to these issues. And when I spoke to Dr. Paul Fleming a couple years ago, one statistic really stood out for me in that was that death by police is the sixth leading cause of death for black men.  It's a fact. It's backed by data. And for us to, as local officials in our own limited ways, to respond to that, I mean, when you hear that, you can't forget that. And that was, that's not only a call to action, but also a call for conversations.  in a number of ways with our community members. We see community leaders here bonding in a peace neighborhood.

He felt better sending him out of this country than staying here as a black townie.  We know that another data reference that I had shared with Cynthia was also from a report on racial equity framework for gun violence prevention. This is from Johns Hopkins School of Public Health and the DC Justice Labs. Black men are stopped by police, arrested, denied bail, convicted and wrongfully convicted, and issued long sentences at much higher rates than their white counterparts. As a result, nearly half of all black men will be arrested before the age of 23.  I think we like to think Ann Arbor is an exception to every rule, but we are, we're not an exception.

I also wanted to directly address, you know, we did not hear any of it tonight, but I have certainly heard from some residents who  expressed maybe some frustration with the inclusion of loud exhaust in this ordinance because of the annoyance that it causes. And I feel so strongly about this that I think we have to address it in some way, even though we didn't hear it from someone at the table tonight, or from someone at the podium tonight.  We heard at the last meeting about an individual who simply couldn't afford to fix their exhaust and was fearful every time that they had to drive their car because of the threat of a stop. And one, we have to stop criminalizing poverty in that way.  But I also, from my experience, there is a souped up motorcycle that I see often near my neighborhood that every time it drives by, everybody has to stop their conversation because it's so loud. And nobody's calling the police on that person because 30 seconds after they've gone by, we've forgotten about it and our lives have moved on. And we have to stop allowing this comfort trade-off  for this modest inconvenience or this modest annoyance to be a trade-off for the true trauma and harm and danger that individuals may be in if the police were called on them or they were stopped for that reason. And so that is why this is included in the ordinance as well. And I'm grateful that we didn't hear from folks coming out in droves  I'm grateful that none of my colleagues wanted to do that either. And then I also just wanted to very briefly give voice because we've heard a lot about the impact that this has on members of the black and brown community here in Ann Arbor and folks who are coming to Ann Arbor. But we actually haven't heard a lot about also the increased level of stops that the LGBTQ community faces, and particularly trans women and trans women of color.  face as well.

As we vote on the Driving Equality Ordinance, we are not just enacting law but setting a precedent. A precedent for prioritizing the well-being of every resident in Ann Arbor over the tedious enforcement of minor traffic violations. We have heard the voices of those impacted by these stops during public comment and throughout the deliberation process. And tonight, we are acting on your behalf.  The dialogue we've engaged in with groups such as the Vera Institute of Justice, the ACLU, ICPAC, and Philadelphia Council Member Isaiah Thomas have been crucial in shaping this ordinance.  These fruitful collaborations have helped us consider every aspect of this issue and our aim to address the chronic stress and unfair burden of low-level secondary traffic stops. Why an ordinance and not merely a policy? The answer lies in the long-lasting and binding nature of ordinances. A policy is internal, not public. It cannot be legally enforced, nor can voters hold us accountable to it.  An ordinance is law. We seek to enforce a change that is resilient, firm, and not subject to the variability of future administrative decisions.  As we stand on the brink of voting on this ordinance, let us remember the journey that has brought us here. The tales of heartbreaking anguish and the calls for change have been our guiding light. I want to thank my fellow co-sponsors, Mayor Taylor and City staff, the Director of Organizational Equity, Laura Orta, the City Attorney's Office, and an extra special thank you to our new Senior Assistant,  City Attorney Jen Janetzky, whose relentless dedication and commitment has brought us to that to this point today.  Now is the time for us to take a bold step forward. To show our city and the nation that we value equity, fairness, and justice above all. We are prepared to do what is right, to lessen the burden on those who have been disproportionately affected, and to ensure that every interaction between our police and the public is rooted in respect and understanding. As we cast our votes, let's remind ourselves of the profound significance of this moment.  Our decisions today will echo far into the future, shaping an Ann Arbor that is safer and more equitable to all of our residents. Thank you for your unwavering commitment to this cause.

Fundamentally, it is incredibly important that our law enforcement focus in our community be the promotion of public safety performed with professionalism and without bias in favor.  The secondary stops addressed by this ordinance are not necessary to affect public safety, simply put. Crucially, however, they unnecessarily disrupt the lives of community members, they corrode trust and confidence between police and community, and they can lead to fear, tension, and harm, as we've heard time and time again.

A brief word on C1. While I'm glad to see that these parcels will be zoned R1D instead of the  ridiculous R1A district that essentially acts as a filter to allow only the ultra wealthy to live in an area. The fact that as a city we're still preventing people from building duplexes on their own property really saddens me. It's an indicator that, as a city, we still aren't taking seriously the goal of allowing anyone, not just the wealthy, to live here. I'm sure the move would be unpopular with our local landlords,  But most of us who live in the present and don't have a vested interest in exacerbating the housing crisis would support you in making it possible for all residential zones to have duplexes on them. Speaking of things that local landlords are likely to oppose, I'm excited to see CA9 come back onto the agenda in August.  I hope that when it does, it doesn't do what is effectively removing $6.2 million from the Affordable Housing Fund, as that seems like a bit of a negative side effect of this. Finally, I want to address sidewalk gaps and bike lane gaps.  especially in light of the recent death of someone who was riding a scooter in the space available to them and got hit and killed by a motorist.

I'm here on behalf of the NLG and the lawyers and legal workers throughout the state who make up our membership to express our outrage concerning the conduct of the Ann Arbor Police Department. Last Wednesday, July 12th, the volunteers of FedUp Ministries were, as they do each week, feeding our community from their free food truck at Liberty Plaza.  Officers from the AAPD used this occasion to arrest a citizen for a minor crime that was alleged to have occurred in another place and on another day. Their protestations to the contrary notwithstanding, this is not the first time the AAPD has carried out arrests at locations set up to serve the hungry and unhoused. We urge this council to take concrete steps to ensure that this is the last. No one should ever have to choose between food and their freedom.  Prosecuting petty theft cannot and must not be held as more important than the basic human right to sustenance. The good people at FedUp Ministries are an important part of the safety net that supports the most marginalized and underserved in our community. Using their work as bait for law enforcement undermines their ability to continue to serve our citizens and is frankly grotesque.  Where are our priorities? What do we value as a community? Are alleged violations of property rights truly more important than the human rights of our most valuable residents, our most vulnerable residents? It shows an utter lack of vision for this city to place law enforcement above all else. In what way was anyone truly protected or served by the Ann Arbor police last Wednesday? In what way did any of us benefit by making it more dangerous to feed or be fed in Ann Arbor?  Finally, let me point out that if we, society at large, citizens of Washtenaw County, or specifically this council, were meeting our obligations to all of our citizens, fed-up ministries would not need to be feeding our neighbors at Liberty Plaza each Wednesday. No one would be resorting to petty theft to survive. And the Ann Arbor police, regardless of their priorities, would have had no one to arrest last week. The police can do better.  This council can do better, both in supervising the police and in serving everyone in our community. And our community can do better.

Good evening. I'm David William Cohen, a Northside resident.  Say hello to the Huron River Water Trail. You are invited to keep the river healthy and beautiful. As people are getting outside in record numbers, the need to put leave-no-trace skills and ethics into action is more imperative than ever. I quote there from the permanent leave-no-trace plaque installed adjacent to the Argo Livery office.  Yesterday, the New York Times had an op-ed about the growing importance of  River recreation in our time of global warming, it focused on Munich's Isar River as green infrastructure, serving the needs and desires of thousands of urban residents. Ann Arbor's Huron River could have been included, a site of exponential growth of human activity, the centerpiece being the Cascades.  I love the cascades, the sound of falling water, the lovely walkway on the berm, the grasses on the banks. Sunday early, I watched expert kayakers practicing maneuvers. Recently, I encountered a young woman reading a book at the foot of the cascades amid dozens of tubers.  The city should be proud of the Cascades' amenity in 19- in 2012, converting a murky head race into an intended kayak and canoe playground as part of a costly project to save Argo Dam and Pond. I appreciate this. But the Cascades' plan failed in significant ways.  Three cascades that were planned became nine. Canoeing was considered hazardous, and canoers were redirected to an alternate portage. Not foreseen, tubing became number one. And ever-growing numbers were bringing their own inflatables, bypassing the livery office. So many people from a wide region seeking a blast at a very small site.  Overwhelming the Cascades neighborhood with traffic, parking issues, litter and drinking. Early on, neighbors began speaking up.  In 2012, police stepped up patrols to deal with the Cascades chaos. Parking restrictions were introduced, and council members seemed to be listening, even joining in with us to collect trash. Nevertheless, the issues of the Cascades traffic have grown year by year. I have two questions. Can the city bring a comprehensive approach to the protection of our neighborhood's security and well-being?  Would the city accept this chaos at other parks, facilities, golf courses, ice rinks, swimming pools, softball fields, special events venues?

Greetings to the mayor, to city council, and staff.  The reason I wanted to come here tonight is to speak about the reparation initiative that the city council is getting ready to, I guess, initiate. I think that before you initiate a reparation committee, you should meet with some of the people that used to live here, that has been moved out of this community. You should listen to some of the pain and anger that they have regarding how they've been gentrified out of the community.  There are people that are born here that cannot afford to live here. You know, those are the kinds of things that I think when you're looking at reparation, you should include that in the conversation, because that's one of the reasons why we need that. For example, you know, we look at City Hall and the employment ratio here.  There's very few black employees here. If you go out on these construction sites, you don't see any black men. The kind of job that we used to do, the hard stuff, you don't see that anymore because they're good paying jobs. So people that really could benefit from that are not being able to benefit. So I think those are the kinds of things that you should look at when you talk about establishing a recreation task force. Because those are the kinds of things that you need to take into consideration. Because just to create an initiative, just  initiative is not something that is valuable. I would also like to speak to the issue. I think I read in the paper about a month, a month and a half ago, where there was a presentation made by the city administrator to build housing, I guess, attached to the city hall. And I think the statement was that there would be no low-income housing, affordable housing.  And I find that to be contradictory to what the city is about. The city should be looking at taking care of those, especially if we're going to be using city property to build housing. People that can't afford housing otherwise should be given an opportunity to live in the structure. After all, this is the people's house. We pay their taxes. We support this. So I think that to say that these units, whenever they are bound to come about,  would not be open to people with low income. I don't think that's morally right. And I would like to congratulate Sister Cynthia Harrison for being a part of this initiative. I knew her mother, I knew her father, I knew her family, and they would be proud of you for taking the initiative that you're taking.

I'm glad that CA9 has been pulled from the agenda for further consideration. I'll keep my comments brief and maybe back in August once I see what the next iteration will look like.  As a part of Council of 2018 through 2022, I co-sponsored the millage for affordable housing. I also co-sponsored the resolutions to transfer the city-owned property to the Housing Commission for a nominal fee of, I think, $1 to build affordable housing. As we all know, this site has a long history of affordable housing. Affordable housing was there before  Things were torn down and left vacant So it was alarming for me to see that council had thought of essentially reneging on prior commitments While on council I was reminded that promises made our promises kept There was the 40 40 20 resolution which I tried unsuccessfully to overturn I  yet it was vetoed and promises were made and promises were kept. When the millage was passed, we all knew it was not enough money. We were gonna need hundreds of millions of dollars to address affordable housing, not just 120 or 150 million. It was just one tool at our disposal, a big tool to transfer city-owned property to the Housing Commission to build affordable housing.  In 2017 and 2018, we heard the value of leveraging dollars so that we can use housing tax credits to leverage 5 million for it to become 50 million. I am just here today urging this council to reconsider this thought, which I believe is a financial shell game. It is to free up $5 million from the general fund  to then spend on other initiatives and projects. Many of you campaigned, most of you, if not all, some were uncontested. But when you're out there, you hear from folks, affordable housing is the number one issue. And since COVID, it's even become more acute of an issue.  I urge this council to honor past resolutions and transfer this property for next to nothing to the Housing Commission. Do not go ahead with taking $5 million from the Ann Arbor Housing Commission.

Now on to my talk. At the last city council meeting, we heard from council member Chris Watson about how he is rightfully afraid of the police. He is rightfully afraid of the police. So you might guess that Watson would identify with Palestinians who are rightfully afraid of being kidnapped and killed by the Israeli military, not just pulled over.  But no, unless Watson is the one, and he cannot even make eye contact. There we go, eye contact. But no, unless Watson is the one getting pulled over and killed himself, he simply doesn't care who Israel kills with his money. Doesn't care at all, far as I can tell. Correct me if I'm wrong.  Israel was almost founded in Uganda in 1905, except the white settlers stopped the whole plan. So instead of massacring Africans, Israel went over and established itself in Palestine to massacre Palestinians. It could have been Africans.  Israel tried to give nuclear weapons, the atomic bomb, to apartheid South Africa to kill black people, Chris. To kill black people, Chris. But Councilmember Watson is too busy to care. Too busy crying like a baby over the sufferings of the European Holocaust, which ended in 1945. What a pitiful sissy. What a pitiful sissy.  He knows what white supremacist state violence is. He knows, but don't ask him for a Palestinian human rights resolution, or he's liable, oh, there goes Iyer, running away from the room. We're gonna talk about you in a minute. Don't ask him for a Palestinian human rights resolution, or else he'll get down on his knees and cry over the tragedy of white Europeans.  Over white Europeans. But white Europeans are not afraid of the police today. They don't need your tears, Chris. Palestinians need you. Do you think it's right, Chris, for Palestinians to pay for the Holocaust? Palestinians? Who gave you that sick idea?  Pitiful as Councilmember Watson is, Jen Eyre sitting there is worse. Eyre took campaign money from old friends of the Israel Defense Forces, and you know the IDF is just like the Ku Klux Klan, except you're paying them $3.8 billion every year.  And look, Ayer is now sinking the whole reparations boat for black people, trying to pit black and native people against each other and put them at each other's throats for reparations money.

All right. Hello, Ann Arbor. I'm here to go over what has happened in the past couple of weeks. The last city council meeting, we, the people, managed to put the issue of reparations to black America on the table. These people here and their buddies before them, no one ever did that.  The people of this town put the issue of reparations on the agenda, on the discussion table a couple of weeks ago. And there is an article in the Ann Arbor News. You can go look it up and you can see how all these people are bellyaching about, oh, yeah, how they really want to do it. If they wanted to do it, they would have done it.  Like Blaine said, in the 1800s, black people were asking for reparations. They were saying, give us a mule and 40 acres and we would sustain ourselves. Did they give it to them? No. These people have no intentions of giving anything to blacks or red people or native people or anything, as much as they say they might, and they don't say it much, but anyway, they have no intention. We have to kick their ass into actually doing it.  So I want to ask everyone in Ann Arbor to come here, speak for reparations, and let's push and force these people to do it.  Again, as Blaine said, and as you can see from everyone who speaks here, the population in this town is not happy with the record that this bunch has. This bunch gets pushed into their places by the donations they accept from the ultra wealthy in this town. They take over the seats and they vote all of them.  with Mr. Mayor here, who is the man for, you know, deciding what goes and what doesn't go. So we want a representative city government. This is not representing the people. As you can see, after 20 years of just talking about  affordable housing. We do not have affordable housing, but we have a whole lot of luxury housing that nobody can afford, $800,000 minimum level of houses you can buy in Ann Arbor. That is a shame. That tells you clearly that this city council does not care about  Regular people, it cares about the rich. This city council doesn't care about blacks, but we have to force them to care. If they did care, do you think the university would be accepting 4% black enrollment? No, they would have been bringing it up to 10%, which is what they promised 50 years ago.  Any of these guys ever pushed the university to do it? No, they haven't. Look at the Ann Arbor now. Lefebvre said it. Many, many communities of black have been pushed out of this town because of these guys. So do not be fooled by them when they tell you, yeah, we will have committees, we will talk about reparations. No, they will not.  They will make sure that it gets grind down to the floor.

This is Tom Spalberg calling from Lower Town in Ann Arbor. I signed up to speak on CA9. I would like to thank council members for not only just pulling this from the consent agenda, but pulling it from the agenda in its entirety. I'd ask that you focus on meeting the expectations of the people. We did pass an affordable housing millage.  And we do have certain expectations, and one of those was the development of affordable housing on that site, at the old Y lot. It was identified that that's just an ideal location for affordable housing, right downtown, right next to the Blake Transit Center. And if you recall, there was talk about not even putting any affordable housing units there, and just having a payment loop for non-affordable housing development. That gladly, fortunately, went by the wayside,  And we had an approval for a building that would have a minimum number of affordable housing units. I forget the exact number, but a couple of towers and one would be all affordable housing. But we also approved the possibility of that building going up as high as 275 feet. It should be about 50% more than people's expectations going into that. So again, as we review this whole project and where the money's going, where it's coming from,  Please think about what the people's expectations were when we passed an affordable housing billage and when we supported development or analysis of the city-owned sites for affordable housing. One of those sites was also 415 West Washington. That one's a bit of a shell game. What's going on there is a, I've spoken about it before, but we're gonna, the way it's designed right now, we're gonna have zero dollars for affordable housing on that site. And it's a bit of a bait and twitch over there.  Nice luxury units, but no affordable housing money whatsoever. I would like to thank certain private developers who are doing the right thing in terms of providing affordable housing, providing sustainable building techniques. I want to call out the developer of the PUD at North Maple. I think it's a shining example. They've been lauding it since they first came to the pre-PUD meeting, to the planning commission, of somebody who studied what the city wants  study what the people of the city want, and deliver it on affordable housing and sustainability from the outset, not being dragged tooth and nail, not having to negotiate. They led the right type of development. And I want to ask us, what kind of message do we send when we applaud a developer like that? But then what's on the agenda tonight later on? We'll talk about the details later.  We're the exact opposite.

The state awarded smart zone funding  to the smart zone entities across the state that we, our local development finance authority, benefited from with the intention of awarding $400,000 in grants for purposes to promote our entrepreneurial-driven and high-tech economy here locally.  Due to COVID, that money was not awarded for various reasons. And instead of, it was a use it or lose it situation where we would, if not spent according to the grant agreement, would have to return that money to the state. So versus returning that money to the state where it would not directly benefit our local economy, the LADFA board did decide to allocate this funding to Spark, who is our SmartZone partner.  And that extra $400,000, this increase in their budget, will go towards two initiatives specifically designed to meet the city's broader goals. And so the two initiatives that SPARK is looking to implement with that funding is a DEI initiative, which would  work to support and directly encourage entrepreneurial growth within BIPOC and minority communities. And the second half of that $400,000 increase would go to support innovation and entrepreneurship  around circular economy initiatives. And so directly in support of two really important things that we've heard the community wants.

And there's no plan for the, there's no assessment of the traffic load.

I look at the multi-use aspects. Go back and look at the old Lower Town  commission plan of 2009 with what they thought was a desirable way to use what had been a great Kroger lot, drugstore, so on.

And I'm sorry I sent it to you twice that the first letter said January 17th. I don't know what I was doing about that. But we need retail in the neighborhood. I'll be careful to avoid now the catchwords you seem to dislike. Preserve, protect, integrity of the neighborhood, maintain character.  Is it wrong for us to want to maintain and protect the character of our wonderful neighborhood? Well, whatever. Instead, I want to ask you to think about the words that you should like, sustainability, walkability, access. Every developer in this area of Lower Town, and there aren't a lot of chances left, will beg off retail because it is notoriously hard to pull off retail anywhere in the city, as many of you know.  Apartments, even expensive apartments like Beekman, are apparently gold mines. The university provides developers with a hard-to-resist market of either rich students or those willing to go into debt by constantly increasing its enrollment. It is irresistible all over town to service this market and ignore our real needs for affordable housing,  And we all know that the paltry requirements the developers are often forced to make by having a small percentage of lower rent units is just that, paltry. The developer of Beekman will tell you that this third building is neither the best spot for retail nor is it the right time. I've already debunked both of those arguments in my letter to you. Mr. Mucher argues that this area historically can't support retail.  But Kroger's was one of the most popular and successful stores in the city, and it failed, as I pointed out to you. It didn't fail, but it was judged by the corporate people that there should be bigger Kroger's, and so they were moved.  It wasn't true back when Kroger's was there that retail couldn't be supported by the neighborhood, and it surely isn't with at least 800 new apartments in the area, along with new hospital facilities and two U of M parking structures right across the street.  He will point to the north side grill block as a better place for retail, but the old party store that's there just sold for a whopping amount, I forget, something millions, and whoever bought it will no doubt give you the same argument, that retail is too unreliable for investment. A bit of retail in this final morningside building, and I'm only asking you for a bit,  Instead of a few apartments on the ground floor would be good for everyone It will make Morningside's apartments more attractive and serve the neighborhood is serve a bad word.

I live on Division Street just over the bridge from this development. And I've been here before. And I'm here again to continue my support for this project and to sort of provide maybe a different angle. There have been discussions so far on sustainability and green initiatives and with fires in Canada and a number of other things and heat waves. It's never been clearer that we have to be concerned about these things.  What I'd like to sort of bring back up is 20 years ago, we were thinking about this. There was a Green Belt Initiative that we passed in 2003, and the idea that was part and parcel of that was to close off sprawl and development going outward away from the center, which would necessitate more driving and more commuting and more greenhouse gases.  but which would necessarily require denser development in core areas that are closer to major attractions in our city, the hospital being an obvious one. This building does just that. And in the time since the Greenbelt Initiative, the last 20 years, and my numbers are vague because I don't know exact numbers and I apologize, but universities enrollment was somewhere in the mid-30s, 30,000, 34,000.  And now we're coming up on 54. So we've gone up by about 20,000 enrolled students in the last 20 years. It took about five years after the Green Belt Initiative for the momentum of development in town to start responding to that initiative. And by about, I think, 2008, we were seeing the first buildings, 411 Lofts on the corner of Division, Washington, Zaragon on the corner of South U and East U, where I think some of the early  early buildings of this type and in the 15-year sense all of them added together if you count the bedrooms is 11,000 bedrooms. So we've created housing for 11,000 more students where the demand has gone almost two to one up because of enrollment. The 800 pound gorilla in this room is the university. It's why most of us live here. It's why this city exists.  And that fact necessitates everything else. We can argue that there's greed or developers do it because they like it or it's irresistible.  Before you get to that point, it's necessary. Everything we worry about in terms of affordability and price points of housing is being driven by that fact first and foremost. And how we respond to it and how aggressively we respond to it in this area and in other areas will determine how much leeway we have to really address the problems of pricing after that. But first, we have to stop falling behind. We're two to one behind. We have to fix that problem first and then  get to things like how we find places to build subsidized housing so that we can get multiple price points. Is that it? That's it.

The city council should vote no on the rezoning, both because the developer is offering so little mixed use that the site will scarcely resemble the mixed use urban village that has long been recommended by the comprehensive plan.  and because this development will not move us toward one of our current planning initiatives, the 15-minute walkable neighborhood. Neither can it boast bringing us closer to our sustainability goals by significant electrification, as was suggested to the developer by the City Planning Commission. Ann Arbor residents are paying a millage for both climate action  and affordable housing. In my view, developers should be part of the equation too. The Ann Arbor public should not be fooled. The current conditional zoning absolutely gives city council the option to ask for more from this development. In other words, city council has a choice. You can vote yes on the rezoning and likely add to Morningside's profits  or you can vote no on the rezoning, thereby giving the developer the opportunity to propose something better, something that is more in line with Ann Arbor's clearly stated goals of making our city more sustainable, more affordable, and more walkable.

I've written to you talking at length about the discretion that City Council has in this vote. And about what some of that means, in terms of being able to achieve sustainability. I am in favor of  a dense resident, primarily residential building at this location. For those who've been around long enough, you recall that the neighborhood back 2016, 2017 was in favor of a primarily residential, very dense development at this location, and we were hopeful that it would include a mixed-use urban village and some affordable housing. We all supported that, and I do continue to support  additional density, residential density on this third base. Got no problem with that. So I want to ask you if you all understand what this means. If you get rid of the conditions on zoning, you get rid of the discretion you have to ask this developer to build more sustainably, to include more affordable housing, to include more retail instead of a pool, for example. It then becomes more of a buy right as a condition on the height limit.  and the developer can build whatever he wants to go. You can approve the site plan that he's got in front of you right now, but then once you walk away with a yes vote on both of these, tomorrow the developer probably isn't going to, but could, go belly up and sell the property and somebody could build something else that meets C1AR and have that height restriction, but maybe they build all office, no residential whatsoever.  Maybe you want to ask staff if that's a possibility. That's up to you if you want to ask. But I want you to understand, when you take away the conditional zoning, you're not locking in the site plan that you approve afterwards. You're giving an approval to it. But the developer can build anything that meets the CUNAR with the remaining conditions. I don't think you are ready for this. At a minimum, postponement is in order to understand full complexity of what this means.  I prefer an outright rejection because of the arrogance of this developer and not meeting our sustainability requirements that other developers are willing to make. 721 South Forest wants to build all electric except for gas-fired backup generators. I believe Valhalla is offering something similar like that. Other developers are doing even better in terms of full electrification. This developer didn't want to put in electric stoves.

Now, to be fair, the developer requested that because that is the only way that you can do a conditional zoning, but the developer did this only because of what they perceived the political reality to be.  One of the previous commenters also already brought up the stark numbers of just what university enrollment growth is doing to us in our housing market. And that's not the only thing. I've had similar numbers of staff growth, and there's other drivers of increased demand for housing in Ann Arbor, even besides the university. So fighting over every single site like this will never get us to where we need to be.  to resolve this housing crisis. We need to allow a lot more development by right.

Density.  is the key to providing the 15-minute neighborhoods we want to see. Unfortunately, historical development practices, including the infrastructure we've built that encourages more driving, works against that. The city simply doesn't have the power to magic up more demand for retail in the space. But you know what the city does have the power to do? Approve more density so more people can live in walking distance, and we can create the conditions  that will allow a 15-minute urban village to thrive in lower town. That's upzone Broadway, that's upzone Pontiac Trail and Travel Road and Swift Street. That's allowed 24 apartment complexes by right in this whole area. And you know what'll happen then?

Awesome, thank you. Hi, so I'm new to these meetings, never been to one before, but been born and raised in this town, 25, and went to University of Michigan as well. And I guess I'm not really familiar with the zoning principles. I'll come to the next meeting more prepared. This is a little bit more impersonal, I'll come in person. But I guess,  The main thing with these zoning concepts that I think I'm a little bit concerned about is just as perceived person who's been in this town for a long time, it seems like everything seems to be going in a very specific direction. And if these zoning principles or whatever, I don't really, frankly, care about developer rights. That's not an important part of this dynamic. I'm seeing dozens of more homeless people on the street every day, and they come up to me regularly asking me for money and having conversations with me.  And it's becoming more and more concerning to me to think about these developments happening when I just don't really understand why. Like I see luxury housing coming up across from my neighborhood, more values of house that are 800,000 to 1.2 million, whereas the housing that's under $1,000 a month. I'm just, I understand there's a lot of folks coming from the East Coast, West Coast who go to school here. I went to school with many of them, but I don't think that that should be where we put the value.  if I'm what I'm hearing is 100 150 units of housing that doesn't sound like quite a lot. I might just be negligent on what the actual zoning policy is here. But it seems like you need to be creating a lot more housing for a specific population and be more creative about how you can get the money for low income housing. I don't know how that works exactly. But my appeal to you all in the city council meeting is if you are to choose to make such an approval or decline  really think about whether this is actually impacting the people actually need it most. I don't, I don't have the answer because I have not even read the policy yet. But that seems integral to this more than is about development. We have enough development here. It's a lovely city, lived here all my whole life. I've been very privileged here my whole life. And I'm concerned about the fact that it's not an actually diversity and that incorporates class.

I hope somebody would do the math and say, for this brand new building, if it's all gas-fired for heat, gas-fired water heaters, gas stoves, and all the other climate costs, just how long will it take to make up for that? How are we going to hit our A20 goal? How are we going to hit carbon neutrality by 2030 if we keep digging these holes  that are very difficult to dig up. And here we have the opportunity to not dig such a deep hole. The millage money that we are all paying is what's going to be needed. But it's not enough. We can't keep compensating for these kinds of projects where there is discretion to get better climate action, better sustainable building from this.  So thinking about the site plan, if you vote no on the first part on conditional zoning, the site plan doesn't matter because you can't do it. If you vote yes, now we have a site plan.

I sympathize with very much that I have heard. So we are asked to amend the conditions of a C1AR zoning district in order to create more than twice the housing units where a less dense project had originally been envisioned.  When you hear amending or lifting the condition, it might sound like we're freeing the developer to do more of what they want. In this case, we're freeing the developer to do more of what we want. Instead of an 80 condo project for sale, we will get 196 units of rental housing.  at a site that is ideally situated to promote walking and biking. It sits less than a 10 minutes walk from a major employer, the hospital, 15 to 20 minutes from Carytown, from Main Street, and from Central Campus. Now, as one of the callers mentioned, a change like this would normally require no more than a new site plan, which would normally not involve a zoning decision.  It would in fact not even come to Council at all, but would have received final approval at Planning Commission. Council is seeing this only because a condition of the original zoning specified that this project must execute the 1140 Broadway condo project site plan. Because the two are linked, we have to amend the zoning in order for the site plan to change.  Now, I really sympathize with desire for mixed use or more peas with our carrots, as it was so delightfully put. We can affirm it. We can have plans that state a desire for mixed use. And we can zone for it. That's how you translate plans into action. And we've done all of that.  But for mixed use to materialize, financiers, being the people who funded developers, not the developers themselves, have to be willing to invest in it. And many other cities give them the opportunity to make a better return on their dollar than Ann Arbor does. So we have no way of requiring mixed use. We can welcome it, and we can make it possible. But we can't require it.  Folks have mentioned electrification. I wish every project that came before the city were fully electric, but as a city, we have no way of requiring that. And even if we did, in this instance, fossil gas heating infrastructure is already in the ground. It was installed when the first phase of this project was constructed.  But that does not mean that this project is not sustainable. Considerable contaminated groundwater was remediated when this got going. The developer installed EV chargers in the parking deck before the city was requiring them and will install additional ones now. This phase of the project will have electric dryers, and the developer has said he is investigating electric stoves.  And really a great benefit of this project is that it provides one protected bike space per unit Which is well beyond what our code requires and these will be located at the ground level with easy egress to the street councilmember Okay, when we come back for the site plan, I'll tell you more councilmember song", "start": 5158.739, "end": 5360.988, "Transition": "\"\"", "Meeting Section": "Other", "Speaker Role": "Other", "is_public_comment": 0, "is_public_hearing": 0, "is_comment_start_trigger": 0, "is_comment_end_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_start_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_end_trigger": 0}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_28", "text": "I was really moved when I heard from folks who remembered the retail that was there at the site before. I mean, I share this memories of Manna, the Korean grocery store there. I celebrated my children's 100-day birthday, first year birthday with mandu, bulgogi. They had fresh tteok, which is rice cakes.  It was very difficult 50 to 20 years ago to find that kind of grocery. Now we have several more Korean grocery stores in town. And it really relied on small family businesses to support this. So in my enthusiasm in responding to some folks who had emailed and I called,  Our commenter tonight I also talked about how we had approved liquor license not too far from this site to just last year and My eagerness in seeing the DTE site being developed but in in talking a little bit more with council members I think another question came up which is financing and  So, who actually pays for these retail spaces and how do we actually occupy these retail spaces? There are reasons why we see new businesses coming in like Taco Bell, Dunkin Donuts, Chick-fil-A coming in. It's because they're financed to come in and they have the funds to do this. To talk about retail in new developments and engage with developers on this end and asking for  the Retail spaces. There's no guarantee that they'll be occupied And the the financial burden is on the developer themselves. So where do And as well as renters, so how do we support? You know Will this be an increase in rent? I mean, it's hard to it's difficult to see it's like a chicken before the egg But I think it's really like the banks  What are the banks willing to finance when it comes to our wishes and dreams and what we see in our community? And it's also a struggle that we see with our own public parcels. As you remember, Jennifer Hall, just a couple meetings ago, said that we're at a point where each unit is at $400,000 in costs, and that's with 11 streams of financing, right? We don't exist out of market conditions.  I'm sorry that we can't somehow capture the good memories and experiences of Ann Arbor from 15 20 years ago where we had small businesses that could thrive and Perhaps this is a question where we can talk about more about small business support and economic development. I'm really happy to hear Councilmember canal speak to this earlier and how we're trying to do that work as well as councilmember Ayers on that particular Commission and  But when it comes to development and planning, it's a different beast And I do hope with the developer here You can understand that sentimental reasons why people would like to welcome mixed use in retail Because it's not just supporting walkable a walkable community But a diverse community with diverse needs and that would rather not see large box retail in our in our downtown corridor  We have a lot of donut shops actually in our city supported by former refugees.

I think councilmember dish spoke to why? That's it's not appropriate for us to be Requiring that in this development at this point and  But I do think that we have opportunities. Council Member Song spoke to the fact that we need to be thinking about small business development, and we obviously are to some degree, but there is work for us to be doing on that. I brought that up during the TC1 discussions as well.  It's something that we actively need to be thinking about as we move forward. But we're also embarking on the update to our comprehensive plan. And it's important to remember that 70% of the land in Ann Arbor resident land is zoned single family only.  And so right now, in our neighborhoods, we don't permit the neighborhood grocery store that used to exist in places like the Old West Side. We've had places like the Knights Market and Jefferson Market, and those are historically areas where we didn't have, it's not a large Kroger, but it's that small little market that existed within neighborhoods that neighbors were able to turn to. We've made that illegal. We have the opportunity to change that in the future, and I hope that folks, when they engage  Planning process will be asking for mixed use in their neighborhoods because I think that is the opportunity for us to bring back affordable retail in To our neighborhoods and across our city. So in terms of this particular project I'm supportive of the zoning changes. I will say for the  Residents that move into this location They are in a 15-minute neighborhood.

The bottom line is that we have a housing crisis in the city of Ann Arbor and that housing prices are too high. They're too high because of  simply put, supply and demand. We are not in the position to depress demand, and so if the housing crisis, if the affordability crisis is unacceptable to us, we have a number of alternatives. We can build housing. We're in the process of doing that with great rigor. We can  permit housing, which we're doing through rezonings, and when we are offered the opportunity for a requested rezoning that meets our goals, that does expand housing in a way, in a place where it is beneficial, we can approve it.

So we just voted to rezone. And in doing so, have we just passed up an opportunity to negotiate with the developer? You heard that a lot in the comments. And the answer to that question is no. By law, in a conditional zoning, conditions are offered by the developer.  And the developer looks for things that they think align with city priorities. Conditional zoning is not an opportunity to impose conditions and exact concessions from a developer. And even if we were inclined to do that, doing it at the council table would be unseemly.  if not worse. So I want to, since we are now talking, I know it feels like we're having the same discussion again, but I want to talk about a couple of features of the side plan that we didn't get a chance to mention earlier. The developer for this project originally agreed to set aside a percentage of units for affordable housing.  That agreement resulted in 15 units that are being rented out at max 60% AMI across the first two buildings of the project. The developer has voluntarily committed to extending those same terms, did not have to do this at all, to 999 Maiden Lane. This will increase the count of affordable housing units by approximately six units at max 60% AMI.  And at the pace that we're moving, constructing affordable housing on our city-owned sites, and we are moving, it's just that this pace is slow. 18 units is not a bad deal. The project, in terms of parking, also satisfies the city's current preference to devote more space to housing people than to storing cars.  The developer proposes to add just 15 additional surface parking spaces, which raises the total of spaces at this project overall to 579 spaces, 30 outside surface, 549 in the parking structure.  What is really cool about this project is it was a social science experiment for our lifting mandatory parking minimums. The project was approved under our old rules, which required minimums. The developer would have been required to provide one parking space per dwelling unit. The project received a variance in 2017 to provide 0.9 spaces per dwelling unit.  The rental housing at 1200 Broadway has been in operation for two years and demand for parking has been 0.6 spaces per dwelling unit. Now, I am not saying that that is the magic number for everywhere, but I'm saying that in a site that is located where this one is, close to the hospital, close to Carytown, close to Main Street, close to Central Campus, 0.6 looks really good and there is no evidence of spillover into the surrounding neighborhood.", "start": 5867.357, "end": 6051.09, "Transition": "\"\"", "Meeting Section": "Other", "Speaker Role": "Other", "is_public_comment": 0, "is_public_hearing": 0, "is_comment_start_trigger": 0, "is_comment_end_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_start_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_end_trigger": 0}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_24", "text": "So councilmember yay for that Councilman Breyer Thank you, I I just want to I thought it was interesting that the word humanitarian was used earlier and That's not one that we often hear here in in chambers and I appreciate the the  the focus on humanitarianism, which of course is the promotion of human welfare. I think there are a number of ways to look at this, and I certainly don't discount the way that the resident was using it. I think another way, and certainly one way that I look at  The promotion of human welfare in our city when it comes to density is Allowing more people to live in our community people who are going to school here people who are working here Giving them a place to live when I see buildings  Do I sometimes lament the architecture? Yeah. But I see them in terms of the people that they house much more so than I see the structure itself. And I think it further helps our current residents when we allow increased density because we  folks are going to end up somewhere. And if they don't end up in new housing, particularly people who are going to the university or who are working at the hospital, that's more existing residential housing units that will be converted into rentals.

A2 STEAM is pretty close by. Ann Arbor Public Schools did a major investment in updating that to a K-8 school, expanding it from a K-6 school. And that is a school that has attracted, has really re-enlivened the neighborhood, brought investment, brought back families who had left the Ann Arbor Public Schools for private and charter schools.  My son finished middle school there, and I feel maybe what we can think about this development is maybe perhaps it's closer to what we see at Valhalla which is across from Pioneer High School at 454 units so this is a fraction of what we see across town, close to public schools, close to employer.  So I think there's a lot of potential to come. Talking about retail is just one part of what we expect in our communities to see in our communities. And perhaps retail will come later on. I feel bad about mentioning donuts. Perhaps that was unseemly. Refugee donuts are actually very delicious. So sorry about that.  I'm not on planning. I am clearly not on planning commission. But I do feel some sort of a level of excitement to think that we'll be addressing the housing crisis. And then Council Member Dish is telling me we'll have 700 units across all three buildings. So I guess we are beating Valhalla across town and looking at density in this area close to University Hospital and Campus Employer.  I'd like to see if we vote in a favor of this work tonight, invite business owners and and potential retail down the road. But first, we have to house folks. That's that's the higher priority here.

We were actually unanimous in this recommendation of rezoning these 11 parcels to R1D. So these parcels come to us through the long path that has been annexation.  And the original recommendation for the parcels was R1A, which is what the context is.  And, I should say and, Planning Commission had an extensive discussion of why should we zone more things R1A when we want, as I just said and we just talked about, greater density. And so we considered whether to align the rezoning of these 11 annexed parcels more closely to A20 goals by assigning a multifamily zoning designation. And we came to the conclusion that  You don't want to fight a four-alarm fire with a garden hose, and so rezoning 11 parcels isn't really a good strategy. And we are about to have a comp plan, and we can talk systematically about what we want to do with single-family zoning. But there was something that we could do.  And that was changed from R1A, which has a minimum lot size of 20,000 square feet, to R1D.  The minimum lot size is 5,000 square feet, and its front and rear setbacks are roughly half, its minimum front and rear setbacks are roughly half that of R1A. So R1D, the front setback is 25 square feet, and the rear is, or rather 25 feet, and the rear is 20 feet.  So that's why it comes to you as R1D and not bigger. In addition, going to R4C, for example, would require different utility specifications, fire hydrant requirements, and other things. So the infrastructure in that area is not in place for that. This is something that we need to think systematically and holistically about as we think through the details of the comp plan of how we achieve densification.  given that it's going to, in places, clash with what we have for utility. And that doesn't mean that the utilities should be a limit. But it means that's a question that we need to think systematically about. So that was why it shifted from R1A to R1D.
