But as you know, of all the city commissions, we are the only commission with the word community in our name. And so we're inviting the community out. We hope to have members of council, members of the police department and others to come out. That forum is going to be September 27th. Now, our normal meeting is on the last Tuesday of the month.  But because of where we wanted to have this meeting in the community, we're moving it from the Tuesday to the last Wednesday, which will be the 27th of September, Wednesday the 27th. And that will be at the Peace Neighborhood facility on Maple Road. So again, we are inviting the public.  We'll be sending out emails to various community organizations, and we certainly invite council and the public to come. We're also looking forward to meeting the police chief finalists in that study.

C1AR zoning seems entirely appropriate for this area. It's right across the street from the athletic campus, near a bunch of other student housing and stuff. And the plan here will provide much needed housing while being way less carbon intensive than most of our other structures in the city. The site plan also provides a free public plaza that's about the size of the library lane surface parking lot, and it provides it at no expense to the city.  So please support C1. Also, while I can't speak to the details of C3, I'm generally supportive of regulations that allow people to make informed decisions. I happen to luck out by purchasing a relatively well-insulated house that isn't incredibly expensive and wasteful to heat and cool, but much of our housing stock is older and poorly insulated. A purchaser may not know they're in for thousands of dollars of insulation work or thousands of dollars of extra energy bills.  It seems perfectly reasonable to require disclosures around energy consumption during a real estate transaction so that new home buyers know what to expect and also to encourage sellers to make energy efficiency improvements prior to sale.

Lower Burns Park, close to Stadium Boulevard, the  the east part of Stadium Boulevard, but that's a handy commute to the west part of Stadium Boulevard, which is part of the proposed TC zoning, TC1 zoning. And I want to speak to TC1 in opposition to two of the changes that have been proposed to making it easier for car dealerships and car rental agencies to set up shop.  Car dealerships and car rental agencies are densely car-centered businesses. They're businesses that exist because of the car, in order to get you to drive a car, and are completely car-brained. A typical additional new car on the road will rack up thousands, if not tens of thousands of miles. Having any kind of  improvement to the ability for businesses in the city to sell and rent cars is at odds with our stated goals. It's at odds with our goals to reduce vehicle miles traveled because what can you do with the car? You can travel some vehicle miles.  It's at odds with our complete streets because these businesses are very car-dense uses. And it's at odds with pedestrian bicycle safety because the sorts of roads that you get when you have lots of car dealerships are roads effectively known as stroads or street roads.  And some people have wittily referred to them as car sewers because they're wide and they're deep and they're nearly impossible to cross on foot or on bicycle. They're dangerous. And things that we can do to reduce the vehicle intensity of our city are all good. So I'm opposed to the proposed changes to TC1 that would  Allow car dealerships and car rental agencies as Even except even special exception uses. I don't see any particular reason. We should yield an inch to those I know that the Members of Council have said nice things about the car repair facilities in their area I can also say nice things about the fellows who fix our cars, but The dealerships and rental agencies.

I will be talking tonight about two items on the consent agenda that total to about a million dollars that are basically for the public right of way, sort of for pedestrian safety. But what I want to say is that  there's a complete lack of any feedback or focus on operations within the pedestrian safety area. And as a council member, I was frequently accused of being negative to staff or negative to my council members. I've given this a lot of thought. The problem is that we have a local political machine  that is focused on more shiny new things. Staff realizes that they will be roadkill if they don't go along with this amorphous political machine in our community.  That said, the city is liable, so the political machine can go over there and do whatever they want, but the city is liable if we have dangerous situations in our community that are not being addressed by the city. Situations that have been identified in writing time after time, and one includes a letter where the city committed to taking actions back in 1998  to keep the vegetation cleared from the right away in the King School neighborhood. That is not being done. It is extremely dangerous and now we will have many vehicles cutting through there because they cannot go southbound on Earhart and they will be using these neighborhood roads to drop their kids off, especially at Saint Paul School. We also have issues of signage. What I call the  A, backwards crosswalk signs, crosswalk signs that are backwards, they're still backwards.

My name is Tom Renkert. I'm the CEO for the Ann Arbor Area Board of Realtors. We represent 1,100 real estate professionals in the Ann Arbor area. On behalf of our membership, I'm here today to speak in opposition to the Home Energy Rating Disclosure Ordinance.  Although we applaud the city's efforts, this ordinance does little to help the city to achieve the 8 to 0 goals. It targets a small group of owners selling their homes, which is given by the owner to the buyer, who typically does not have the financial resources to act on the recommendations that are presented through the ordinance.  We have worked openly with the city staff and the Energy Commission to thoroughly understand the proposed ordinance and are aware of the city's plans to hire one home energy assessor, even though the ordinance does not include the cost of the assessment for the city to bear this expense.  Keeping in mind that the city staff has also pointed out that they have met with additional firms to help with assessments. Staff is clearly aware that one assessor will not be able to meet the demands in a timely fashion, potentially stalling home sales and or adding additional cost to the transaction.  If you would please, consider our rental housing inspection process as a framework for energy assessment. With as many as five inspectors on staff, it can take several weeks and sometimes several months to have a rental property inspected. Most importantly, and as pointed out in our August 3rd letter to city council, sellers will not be able to meet the advertisement requirements of the ordinance.  Additionally, it's clear from the 30-month report to the Portland City Council that most buyers are not in a financial position to make this kind of improvement needed to increase their score significantly. If by chance they are, realtors locally point out that buyers will prioritize the need to improve their home, such as making updates to kitchens or baths over adding installation to their homes.  Either way, after making one of the largest investments of their lifetime, the facts from the Portland study show that new buyers simply do not choose to make energy-based improvements to their homes. Lastly, let's keep in mind that this is a very basic checklist. It's not a blow-door test. It estimates the cost to heat, cool, and light the property. Rather than an estimate, please remember that buyers can contact DTE and obtain an actual cost for recent years.  Honorable council members, we respectfully ask that you empower city staff to design an incentive based energy assessment program, a model that others will follow a program that will empower all Ann Arbor homeowners to actively participate in achieving the 8 to 0 goals rather than a forced program for sellers who will only face punishment after leaving our great city.

I'm here to encourage you to vote yes in support of Carytown Concert House's club liquor license application with the city of Ann Arbor.  Carytown Concert House is proud to be entering its 39th year as a non-profit arts venue, a cultural gem in our community that offers a unique opportunity to enjoy exceptional artists in an intimate historical setting that is unlike any other concert experience in Ann Arbor.  This coming 23-24 season, we have plans to present 90 concerts with a culturally diverse and eclectic combination of local, national, and international world-class artists. As the Artistic and Executive Director, I believe this club license is instrumental to the future growth of the organization and would greatly enhance our ability to serve the community and attract folks to the Carytown Farmers Market in Carytown area.  For the past few decades, KCH has routinely applied for and used all 12 allowable special license from the state each year for special events. KCH founders, a club of supporters who give $300 or more annually, have expressed a desire to have more than 12 opportunities to enjoy wine or beer at KCH in a given year.  After decades of going through the arduous process of obtaining the special license, the KCH Board of Trustees now supports a club liquor license for the organization, as it would allow us to more easily build community among its founders club by routinely offering concert afterglows and other events especially for them, such as artists meet and greets, including wine and beer.  It will also help us generate additional revenue for KCH through increased concession sales. And it would allow us to thoughtfully target concerts and special events that would lend themselves well to the inclusion of alcohol concessions, such as concerts held on New Year's Eve or Valentine's Day, our Dance Hall Night Series, our Wine Women and Song Concert Series, or concerts that occur in conjunction with other area events, such as Kindle Fest or Ann Arbor Pride.  It would also offer us the opportunity to give a similar scenario as happens at other iconic venues here in Ann Arbor, such as the Arc and the Michigan Theater. On behalf of the KCH staff and board of trustees, I want to thank you for your favorable consideration of our application and assure you that we will use the license with appropriate care and responsibility. We look forward to your support and also to seeing you at the house for a concert soon.

I'd like to speak to you on three topics tonight. First, CA10, the purchase of a new wood chipper, combined with CA11, the rental of street sweepers.  While I'm in favor of both of these and don't believe they should be at all controversial, the fact that as a city we're willing to purchase or rent new fossil fuel powered devices for these purposes that have spent years delaying the purchase of similar equipment size for bike lanes shows a sort of double think with respect to our environmental goals.  For bike lanes, we're reducing the effectiveness of these energy-saving, emissions-reducing bike lanes by demanding a very high bar for the maintenance equipment that we buy, a bar that we simply are not applying to other purchases by the city. If studied, I would reasonably expect  that purchasing even a diesel-powered street sweeper for the bike lanes that would allow us to make them properly separated and protected would have net negative emissions due to the car trips that would be turned into bike trips. The same cannot be said for either of the items on these orders tonight. If we truly want to meet our 80-0 goals,  we should be willing to do the potentially unpalatable but still very effective things to help achieve these goals, especially if we're willing and able to do those same unpalatable things for goals unrelated to H2O. Second, I'd like to speak on the TC1 amendment, C2. I'm  deeply concerned about the addition of automobile-related uses, even with a special exception as primary uses. There's no indication that these exceptions will be within the spirit of TC1, and the addition of automobile-related uses as a valid primary use runs a strong risk of entirely defeating the purpose of the TC1 district.  Please reconsider this. Finally, I'd like to request that the city make a bike lane gap dashboard similar to the very useful sidewalk gap dashboard we have. This dashboard should not simply be bike lane or no bike lane, but rather include a level of service. 30 seconds. And abilities. No bike lane is obviously a gap, but painted bicycle gutters or even buffered bike lanes that have a whole  Two strips of paint a car would have to cross to kill a bicyclist are woefully insufficient.

Good evening. This is Tom Stalberg calling from Lower Town in Ann Arbor. And I'm calling with regards to C1, which is a rezoning with conditions for the block bounded by State, Stimson, Henry, and White Streets, commonly known as South Town. The conditional zoning request should be denied for the following reasons. It is the kind of conditional zoning that the courts have  very clearly ruled against. And it would create significant possible repercussions to property owners and tenants from many blocks nearby in the area commonly known as Lower Burns Park. And there is a legal remedy. The same exact site plan could be approved in a different manner that would be legal. The way it's applied for is not, I suggest you speak with your city attorney about that for a more formal opinion, but this is very similar  So what happened with the Garnet, which was voted down because the conditional zoning there was not legal, but it was later approved with the exact same plan with the PUD. So let me focus on some of the ramifications of doing it this way. Right now, the city has decided that short-term rentals that are not owner-occupied should not be allowed, not permitted.  in areas that are residentially zoned. That would include dislocation, but it would also include everything along State Street between State and White as you go up north from here, Stadium, Granger, McKinley, Dewey was in there, all the way up to Arch where north of Arch it's already zoned for something that would permit short-term rentals. So you take all these areas that are not intended for short-term rentals per our law,  And if you approve this one with the condition, in this case, they're going to allow short-term rentals, but they're going to cap it to a certain amount. Conditional zoning for the next person that applies in one of these places up and down State Street, across from University of Michigan's athletic facilities, you can't say no to the next person because conditional zoning has to be voluntary by the developer. And you can't turn them down for not volunteering what the last one did.  30 seconds. You're backing into a situation where you're going to be forced to approve potentially downtown height buildings or a conversion of those houses, as is, into short-term rental situations, removing from our long-term rental stock in an area that, right now, it's mostly student rental, but there's also a lot of families that live there. So whether you're an owner-occupant or a tenant, we risk  losing long-term housing stock in favor of short-term housing by accident. If we did this deliberately as part of the comprehensive plan revisions, so be it. I'm not backing into it.

I moved to Ann Arbor about a year ago from Evanston.  where my partner was a graduate student at Northwestern. It's a very similar kind of college town. And there, we rented a one-bedroom apartment about 550 square feet for $1,200 a month. We anticipated moving here that we'd be able to find similar rentals because the cost of living comparisons suggest that Ann Arbor is only 1.5% to 2% more expensive than Evanston. We were shocked then to discover  that a comparable apartment here is $1,600 a month, which is 33% more expensive than what we were paying. It is particularly egregious because salaries here are about the same as they are in Evanston. So this represents a large percentage of our income. I rent from McKinley Properties at Traver Crossing now, which we have found to be less than desirable. We've had issues with mold.  a hot water heater that is constantly in and out of service, as well as struggling to get any kind of maintenance for things as simple as a light switch repair. Public spaces, for example, the laundry room is consistently covered in mold, has standing water, and roof ceiling tiles that disintegrate and are not repaired despite repeated requests for maintenance.  We've had five property managers since I've been here, which is only a year. So there's been no continuity in management for tenants. And just a very small example of the lack of respect for tenants, the washing machines changed from being coin-operated to being app-operated recently. The app itself is buggy, and in its privacy policy, it says that  Not only does it collect all of your data, your demographics, your location, your employment, your name, your birthday, your email, your phone number, it can and will sell it to third parties and other vendors that they can use in their marketing materials. And I don't know about you, but I don't really like it when my washing machine is selling my data. So I tried to use a wash card where you pre-fill it. But the pre-filling card station is located in the property management office.  which has been closed all summer because our property manager is managing four other properties and has been unable to be on the property at all. This is not what I signed up for. This is not what we pay for. And I'm really hoping that Ann Arbor City Council will continue its work for tenants' rights to make these situations better.

But last year, after management increased my rent by $125 per month, and then, as I was deciding whether or not to remove my lease, retracted this offer and raised my rent an additional $50 per month, I tried to find a new apartment. I soon learned that McKinley Properties owns 60% of the workforce housing in Washtenaw County, making it nearly impossible to leave a McKinley property.  When I did find some alternatives, each property had a waitlist for new tenants and a waitlist fee, usually around $350. Even though these fees are refundable, a spot on a waitlist did not guarantee a unit, and I would need to make multiple deposits or run the risk of not getting an apartment. I could not afford to pay hundreds of dollars in waitlist fees, essentially interest-free loans to landlords, but also could not risk finding myself without an apartment. So I was forced to stay in my McKinney apartment.  Again, this spring, when it came time for my renewal, the new lease came along with a $220 per month increase and an increase to late fees and pet fees. Last time I spoke at a city council meeting, it was in support of the right to renew ordinance, which passed last fall. This, along with the early leasing ordinance and creation of the renter commission, marked important steps the council has taken toward giving security to tenants and holding landlords accountable. But there is much more that can and needs to be done. First, eliminating both refundable and non-refundable fees that prohibit many renters  from finding, moving from, or staying in an apartment. Second, ensuring that existing ordinances and building codes are enforced, and proactively addressing tenant issues by working with the Renters Commission to expand renter protection. And finally, endorsing the effort to repeal the statewide rent stabilization preemption and refer local government power to make laws about equitable rent.  She used the words of McKinley CEO Albert Barrett, who spoke on a Claims Detroit podcast last year. 30 seconds. 100% of Washtenaw County, if not just 60%. If city council does not take action to protect renters, the city will soon be owned by its landlord.

Sometimes it doesn't take a revisionist to enlighten us about the exaggerations we find in the Holocaust narrative. Often the enlightenment comes at the hands of the Holocaust traditionalists themselves. Recommended reading from the Anna Republic School's Holocaust curriculum is the well-known novel Night by the famous Elie Wiesel, page 32.  Not far from us, huge flames were rising from a ditch. Something was being burned there. A truck drew close and unloaded its hold. Small children, babies. Yes, I did see this with my own eyes. Children thrown into the flames. Is it any wonder that ever since then, sleep tends to elude me?  And in another book by the same author, The Jews of Silence, he writes about the alleged massacre of 33,000 Jews in Babi Yar in the Ukraine.  From page 48, we read, eyewitnesses say that for months after the killings, the ground continued to spurt geysers of blood. Without supporting evidence, Wiesel wants us to believe that blood spurted out of the ground in geyser-like fashion for months, when no one has ever seen such an occurrence. But in a third book, Legends of Our Time, Wiesel comes clean.  In the introduction, he writes about a conversation with the local rabbi. What are you writing, the rabbi asked, stories. I said he wanted to know what kind of stories, true stories. About people you knew? Yes, about people I might have known. About things that happened? Yes, about things that happened or could have happened. But they did not? No, not all of them did.  In fact, some were invented from almost the beginning to almost the end. The rabbi leaned forward as if to measure me up and said with more sorrow than anger, that means you are writing lies. I did not answer immediately. The scolded child within me had nothing to say in his defense, yet I had to justify myself. Things are not that simple, rabbi. Some events do take place but are not true.  Others are, although they never occurred. What will the reaction of Ann Arbor students be when they read of such an admission?

So I have been a renter in the Ann Arbor area since I moved here in 2016. And I've spent most of that time in McKinley properties. My partner and I currently live at Evergreen. But for some background, my partner lived with roommates in The Villas, which is over on Gulfside, before I joined them here. And in that apartment with McKinley,  The ceiling collapsed twice. Once before I moved in and again after in two different rooms. Still have a plush toy that's got some damage. So you can see why my partner got anxious when we discovered a cabinet door in our current kitchen would no longer open all the way because it was scraping against a drooping ceiling.  We had to report the ceiling three times. At first, we reported just that it was drooping, then that there were cracks that had begun to spread. And finally, after almost two full months with no response, we submitted a report that let them know the ceiling now sagged several feet across. Along with those reports, I had to call at least twice.  In the end, they got a contractor to come out, ignore our instructions to contact us before entering, and get drywall all over our kitchen. They had neglected to put down a tarp or any other potential reasonable protections, so our appliances, countertop, and the floor were coated in debris. And because we weren't informed that they were coming, our cats were exposed to the dust while we were away.  And while the work was being done, we had no easy access to our kitchen to prepare food in our home. We didn't know what to do at the time or who to talk to for help as McKinley had proved unreliable. And that's just one example of sort of what we've dealt with there.  Just providing housing comes with significant responsibilities. It involves management and maintenance. It requires varying costs of insurance. And I'm sure there's so many other concerns I don't know about yet. But as tenants, we pay McKinley to cover these costs and fulfill these responsibilities.

Okay. Sorry about that technical issue.  Yes, my name is Justin Yuan, and I've been a McKinney property tenant for three years. I am calling in on the issue of non-refundable fees and tenant applications. Even as they raise their rent year after year, landlords charge fees for applying to wait lists, to applying to rental properties, and everything in between. They want to make money, not just on the people who are having to sign leases, but everyone who's even looking for housing in the area, right? Something that we all need in this age of human rights.  Even when these fees are ostensibly refundable, it's extremely difficult and nigh impossible to actually get refunded. I urge City Council to eliminate non-refundable fees and heavily restrict even refundable fees in order to remove the burden from tenants who can't bear this cause as much as a landlord who might lose out on 50 bucks. This is a necessary step in addressing the larger issue at hand of landlord greed and overreach.  The result of recent reforms, like the early leasing ordinance and right to renew, show that landlords themselves, whether they're huge corporate monstrosities like McKinley or even so-called office-top landlords, can't be trusted to obey these things on their own. They can't be trusted to follow new reforms that get passed and can't be trusted to follow standards, regulations, and guidelines that already exist.  We need to fully fund the departments, offices, and relevant mechanisms to enforce everything that we have on the board already and go further in strengthening that infrastructure and building up the capacity to fully hold landlords to account and make sure that we have housing that we can live in, that we can not just live in and keep the rain on us, but live dignified lives, where we don't have to deal with mold, respiratory issues. We don't have to deal with structural issues that put our compartments away.  where we can live like human beings. I highly urge city council to take tenants' rights seriously. In my day job, I'm a union organizer. And we all know, as many of you do on city council, that workers are on the back foot. But when I started doing this housing stuff, when I started having housing issues of my own, I found that tenants, the rights for tenants and the fight that we have makes the fight that we're waging on the worker organizing side seem like a cakewalk.  It's absolutely brutal, and we have little to no recourse on a wide, wide range of issues. No, we're all workers, whether we're in the workplace or out of the workplace. And I know many of you on this council make a big deal out of your co-worker credentials. I highly urge you to take this seriously, and realize you can't be a pro-worker while also neglecting the crisis and taking these things like they're not serious.

I think it's great that it's there.  But if you're heading west on Catherine and making a left-hand turn, heading south on 5th Ave, I've noticed some real close calls with a couple people riding down, because you're kind of coming down a hill on Catherine.

I have worked for Washtenaw County Community Mental Health as a support coordinator before my present position as a care coordinator for Michigan Primary Care Association, where I work with 40 fairly qualified health centers, including Packard Health. I'm also a member of the Washtenaw County Social Services Board and the Fund Review Board, to name a few. Since moving to Ann Arbor in June 2016, I have lived in seven different apartment complexes, including my present home at Park Place, owned by McKinsey Properties,  and one privately owned condo as some of you condominiums. The reason for moving often has to do with the cost of housing in Ann Arbor. I have learned that housing doesn't accommodate middle class single parent households or lower income individuals. Housing in Ann Arbor is geared mainly towards higher income families and college students. In addition to this, private landlords or property management companies are not the best landlord. I have lived in private property as some of you only to have a landlord who is more interested in receiving regular monthly income instead of providing safe housing.  Upon moving out, my DTE bill had increased significantly due to faulty window treatment. My current place of residence is worse because my mailbox hasn't broken since moving in, and the washer and dryer downstairs need purchase and debit cards. I had signed a lease to pay $1,399 in rent in April 2023, only to receive a monthly billing statement showing regular rental increases. I paid $1,457.95 for May,  $1,492.30 for June and $1,497.04 for July. I believe cooperative housing is a great idea, and I did suggest this during the funding review team meeting. Cooperatives are affordable and are created to accommodate multiple income levels in addition to having tenants serving on the board to address community concerns. When concerns are raised with property management or private landlords, the issues are not addressed immediately.  In addition to this, some income-based units that are available at some apartment complex are still relatively high in cost. Plus, as thought to be wrong, some subsidized housing complexes are horrible due to negative connotations associated with the word subsidized in poor individuals. We must remember that safe, affordable, livable, and equitable housing is a human right. In fact, one of the social determinants of health includes safe housing.  When individuals are unable to afford or do not receive safe housing, it can affect their mental health, well-being, and quality of life.

The reason I'm there is strictly because of the location. The location is great. Everything else is terrible. It's right across the street from my daughter's school. She's able to walk to her dad's house and to her friend's house. So that's super important. Our two-bedroom is $1,623. With fees and utilities, it's over $1,700 a month.

If you're a renter, there's really no cheaper place than McKinley.  It's not a healthy place to live. We have black mold. And the main problem is the plumbing is from like the 60s. It all needs to be replaced, but that's not... McKinley's never gonna do that because it's way too expensive. So the plumbing continuously leaks and we continually have mold and bad air quality.

Now, over the course of the season, you will still be able to put out all the bags that you fill. I don't think even at 10 bags a week, you're going to  exceed the limit. If you put, you know, even if you did 10 every week from September to whenever it is, December, you wouldn't run out. You just can't put them out all at once. And I want to just explain that the main motivation for this change is safety for the city employees who collect our compost.  They have to load each bag by hand onto a truck, and those trucks are not low to the ground. This council has been an advocate for worker health and safety when evaluating contractor contracts, and this workflow management aims to protect our in-house workers. So we are not, this is not a change that we vote on, but it is a change that I personally support.  And if you're worried about how to adapt to it talk to your neighbors We don't all clean our yards up in the same week And so and I'll just let anybody know that if you you know, I'll do it once that's all I ever do I'm very lazy You are welcome to drop 10 of your bags off in my front yard anytime My bags aren't out there and I bet you can can reach similar agreements with your own neighbors Thank You councilmember song", "start": 3231.929, "end": 3336.167, "Transition": "\"\"", "Meeting Section": "Other", "Speaker Role": "Other", "is_public_comment": 0, "is_public_hearing": 0, "is_comment_start_trigger": 0, "is_comment_end_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_start_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_end_trigger": 0}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_24", "text": "I don't know if I can make the same offer. I'm sorry to see that Mr. Kaku has left. Actually, I was really delighted and surprised to hear from him. So I wrote a little note. Hopefully, he's still watching and will return and watch online. I actually know that Kaku is from when I did my MSW field placement at International Families Outreach Project on North Campus Housing back in 2003. So that's 20 years ago.  And at the time, the housing struggles were, for international students, quite complicated, since spouses, because of their visa status, were not allowed to work here in the States. So the housing crisis continues two decades later. I really appreciated the comments, because I think we forget that we assume the housing crisis impacts mostly students. Clearly, it impacts families.  And for the Kakus, I think I want to remind folks that this is a family that raised two children in Ann Arbor Public Schools. Lydia is an active artist. You've seen her work. Oh, Mr. Kaku. I've been to Lydia's art exhibitions. Her work has been featured in Sweetwaters. Beloved community members that we know and see and witness struggle.

I think I spoke a couple of meetings ago about upgrades to the Almendinger Park playground. I went past the park today and noticed that the work started this week. It looks like the existing playground minus the merry-go-round is fenced off while they do the upgrades, but it's supposed to be a four-week timeline. So I wanted to mention that, Ward 4 news. I also wanted to draw people's attention to the work of Dr. Fred Fang, who's an assistant professor at U of M Dearborn.  who's been doing a bike counter project on North Division near Catherine over the last year or so. I saw him Friday night at Ann Arbor's monthly bike party. This is an all ages, all abilities slow roll through Ann Arbor. I encourage you all to attend sometime. It's really a lot of fun and very accessible.  Anyway, he let me know that record numbers were coming in. He had the July numbers, and his team observed an all-time high monthly count of 10,502 bike trips. Average daily trips were 339. The peak day count was 508, which is also the all-time high. That's over 10,000 rides that were not in a car, helping us not only with our climate action goals, but also with congestion for those who are driving.  And we're seeing the number of rides, this is consistent with an increase that we're seeing in bike riding as we build out buffered, separated bike lanes. Division in particular was just recently extended all the way down to Hoover. And so I think this just highlights the importance of creating a safe, complete network for people to get where they need to go.  You can visit the dashboard. If you just Google bike counter in Ann Arbor, it will come up. His team uses a cable on the ground, much like you see for automobile traffic counts. And just as a warning, they haven't been collecting winter data because the cable is susceptible to snow plowing. So if you go there and you see no rides for the months, I think, of like November until May, it's not because there were no riders. It's because they weren't counting during that time.", "start": 3598.963, "end": 3715.952, "Transition": "\"\"", "Meeting Section": "Other", "Speaker Role": "Other", "is_public_comment": 0, "is_public_hearing": 0, "is_comment_start_trigger": 0, "is_comment_end_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_start_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_end_trigger": 0}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_31", "text": "So that's it.

I know that this is something as a liaison to the Renters Commission along with Councilmember Harrison that we're working on quite regularly. I do want to just reiterate, you know, I think many of us have spoken with our legislative leaders about the need for state action in order to enable rent control to allow our local government to even do anything  that looks like a restriction on rent. And so it's something that I certainly support. It's something that I know many of my colleagues support. Council Member Harrison and I are also working with staff right now on legislation to address the non-refundable fees and waitlist fees. We know that it's a problem. We have recommendations from the Renters Commission. And so we've actually met with legal staff and are beginning to work on an ordinance to hopefully address that. And so hopefully we'll have more action soon.  And then I also just want, I know that we have a closed session this evening or a plan for a closed session this evening. And so if anyone who is still on this list is not able to stay till the end of our meeting and you want to send us your comments, we will also of course read them that way and make sure that they get into the record. But I just want to make sure that everybody has an opportunity to be heard even if you can't stay to the conclusion of the meeting.  Finally, I will announce that Council Member Ghazi Edwin and I have our next office hours, our coffee hour on August 19th at 11 a.m. It will be at the Bryant Community Center, and so we are doing it in coordination with Derek Miller, the Executive Director of CAN, to talk about the work on sustainability in the Bryant neighborhood.

In line with the federal emphasis on seniors aging in place, our commitment to inclusivity demands that every voice in our community is given a platform. I've discerned a gap in the ordinance which establishes the Transportation Commission. While it maintains the participation of seven public members, there is a potential oversight. There's no designated seat for someone 55 years or older.  Given that the ride provides passes for those age 60 and above, and in light of AAATA's cutback on same-day prayer transit services, efficiently hindering them from social engagements, unexpected medical visits, and contributing to car emission reductions, it's paramount to acknowledge that, akin to individuals with disabilities, seniors possess distinct transportation demands.  These include adaptive and easily accessible active mobility services, especially as the city moves forward toward more active mobility initiatives. Additionally, the City of Ann Arbor's proactive engagement in drawing seniors to settle here accentuates this oversight. Their contribution can offer invaluable insights paving the way for a public transit system that is more user-friendly for all age brackets.  Ensuring the representation can help us gain a deeper understanding of their needs and lead to improvements in our transportation framework. I propose that we revise the bylaws to reserve at least one seat for a community member who is 55 years or older. This step will ensure the incorporation of the unique perspective and requirements of our senior community in our transportation policies and services.

So we are asked to rezone 10 lots that total 1.66 acres, which are located south of East Stadium Boulevard between South State Street and South Industrial Boulevard in the central part of the city proximate to campus.  We're asked to make the rezoning from the current zoning designation of R4C to C1AR with conditions. This will allow considerably greater density on these parcels, which are currently multi-family residential, and it will allow construction of two multi-story towers for a mixed-use building totaling 220 square feet,  that will provide approximately 215 apartments and include ground floor, retail, office, and childcare space. I would like to make it clear that the city's approval of South Town would not obligate us to approve future applications for C1AR zoning in that area, and it would not open the door for a flood of STRs in that area. Zoning is considered on a site-by-site basis. If all things were equal on a future zoning petition,  If our approval of this decision would make a compelling argument for approval in a future case, but it would not force our hand.  Even in similar geographies, the attributes of a rezoning are rarely identical from petition to petition. So, when this petition came before Planning Commission, we heard strong support, and we heard some strong support earlier tonight, because there is considerable excitement for the proposed project. It is an innovative, all-electric project with rooftop solar to reduce its carbon footprint and geothermal heating and cooling.  If all goes well, it will be the first tall mass timber construction in the state of Michigan. There are some state guidelines that I think still need to be worked through around that. This is a building structure that continuously stores carbon and will store approximately 1,740 metric tons of carbon, which, if you were wondering, is equivalent to over four  million miles driven by gas-powered cars, so that's a lot. This project does not come to us as a PUD because that would not be correct. There is an appropriate zoning category for it in our code, and that is C1AR. The developer offered four conditions.  The maximum height for these buildings will be 100 feet. C1AR has no height limit, so that's a significant restriction that is being offered. The maximum number of vehicle parking spaces for residential use on the property will be .25 per dwelling unit, which is low, and we like that, or we have expressed a liking for that.  The principal use of the property shall be multiple family residential and no more than 30% of the dwelling units may be short-term rentals. Finally, the property shall have no natural gas connections except for emergency backup power. All but the third of these, the one about 30% only for commercial use, or rather short-term rentals, all but that one were part of the site plan that the developers brought to the planning commission  so they were willing to offer these conditions and the conditions will be binding on any project that's built on this site.", "start": 4809.595, "end": 5020.874, "Transition": "\"\"", "Meeting Section": "Other", "Speaker Role": "Other", "is_public_comment": 0, "is_public_hearing": 0, "is_comment_start_trigger": 0, "is_comment_end_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_start_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_end_trigger": 0}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_20", "text": "Thank you.

So these modifications to TC1 are a first installment on a request that Council made of Planning Commission. They permit two new uses with special exception permission or special exception use approval.  and that is automobile, motorcycle, recreation vehicle, equipment, sales, and rental, and automobile, truck, and construction equipment repair. Council had asked for particular attention to repair. It comes back to us, including sales, in recognition that auto repair is often, even typically, attached to retail.  And it comes back with retail as well as repair in the confidence that the form-based standards of TC1 make it safe to permit limited automobile-related uses. So our setbacks, other pedestrian-friendly features, and especially the limitations on surface parking.  But Planning Commission voted to make it a special exception use because it will give us an opportunity to have a good look at any site plan that comes forward for a facility such as this one. In addition, the storage and repair of automobiles, trucks, and construction equipment has to be located in an enclosed building.  Now, I understand the objections that were raised, and I think it is certainly worth deliberating them, and I know that we can start that tonight and do it again, but I want to say that without making this change, existing auto-related uses on the corridors become non-conforming, and that means that they will  kind of be frozen in amber. They will not be significantly updated until they simply become obsolete and pass out of service. This change gives existing auto-related uses conforming status, which opens the possibility that they can apply for updates that are better aligned with TC1 forms.  than their current form is. Most of the other changes are for clarity and to reduce confusion, so I'm not going to talk about those.

And just as a little bit of background for those who may not be familiar with what TC1 is, it was a relatively new zoning category that we've developed in the city that's transit corridor planning, which is  aimed at increasing the density along our major transit corridors. This is one of the pieces that we recognize that we need vastly much more housing in the city of Ann Arbor, and it is one of the tools. We need many tools, but in increasing supply, hopefully we can  at least stabilize prices in terms of cost in our community. So that was one of the pieces of really trying to reimagine some of our commercial corridors. Staten Eisenhower was the first corridor that we rezoned. Stadium-Maple area is the second, and that was done last fall. When that was done,  Stadium maples in the fifth Ward one of the things that came out and that is that that is already a very successful mixed-use commercial corridor and One of the the pieces that we heard during that and one of the reasons that council had unanimously recommended that planning Commission come back and  make a few tweaks to the ordinance was because we recognize that while we are looking to enhance have a much less car centric community in the future we recognize the needs for that. There are times that we might want to have  We essentially still want mixed-use neighborhoods. That's a goal in our A20 plan strategy for action six is to develop mixed-use neighborhoods. And so on that piece, the car rental sale, I think it makes sense that we're having it as a special exception use.  Obviously, I don't really want to see any more car dealerships there, but as we're asking folks to live car-light lifestyles, having access to car rentals in close proximity to where they live in the future would be helpful for allowing them to live car-light lifestyles. Secondarily, on the car repair piece of things,  You know, it is not necessarily, if we limit these from our neighborhoods, what we're asking is basically for them to move to the townships, and that then folks are driving their cars out to the townships and not able to walk home to their homes. So there are some additional benefits there. Also, if we're trying to build more homes for folks, maybe we shouldn't ask them to drive out of the city to get to a job.  So that was some of the rationale behind it. I did have one question for staff in terms of the changes that were made, and that was a question around the enclosure for car repairs.

Good evening. My name is Zach Wasmith. I'm a manager in the Office of Sustainability and Innovations. I'm pleased to present to you the H.E.R.D. ordinance tonight or to represent it.  Briefly, the herd ordinance would, in short, require that homes in Ann Arbor acquire a home energy score prior to being listed for sale. The goals of this requirement are to enhance consumer protections by providing information about the full costs of operating a home prior to purchase and to provide a clear pathway to safer, healthier, more comfortable, and more efficient homes.  In addition to some of the responses that we've already provided to your questions, I will respond to some council questions directly asked as a part of this staff introduction.  So question one, how might this ordinance negatively impact homeowners who are lower income or don't have discretionary income, what mitigation measures are in place to ensure that further displacement of black and other ethnic minorities within the city do not occur as a result of this ordinance.  A few things to note in response to this. First, as I mentioned, one of the primary goals of the HERD ordinance is to help protect homebuyers from unexpected energy costs associated with inefficient homes. Families who face energy burden spend more than 6% of their income on energy. And in Michigan, low-income residents spend on average 15% of their income on energy bills.  These households are disproportionately low-income families with children, Black, Indigenous, or people of color, and seniors. So by requiring home sellers to disclose the energy efficiency of their homes, it can protect home buyers from purchasing a home that they would otherwise be beyond their means to heat and cool.  Secondly, the herd ordinance does not require a certain score to be achieved. This ordinance is not a performance standard, but instead it requires that a score be obtained. Even so, information gathered from the home energy score can be used to apply for city programs to help make strategic home improvements.  Third, the program will offer free home energy scores via a full-time OSI staff member and the hiring of additional capacity in the private sector as needed. This means there are no required financial costs to the home seller for getting the home energy score.  And lastly, the herd ordinance as presented tonight contains section 8606, which is a waiver program which could be used if an unexpected burden or event occurred, which prevented somebody from getting their home energy score.  Question two, when the feasibility study for this ordinance was performed, was there an investigation into the experiences of BIPOC, lower income, disabled, and older homeowners and renters in the cities where similar ordinances are already in place? If such an investigation was conducted, how did the ordinance impact the buying, selling, and renting experiences of these homeowners and renters?  Did the implementation of similar ordinances in other cities impact the availability of affordable housing stock? Can documentation be provided to support the answers to these questions?  The U.S. Department of Energy report that analyzed communities where homeowners were required to secure home energy score assessments before selling their homes found that final home prices were half a percent higher for every one-point increase in the DOE's 10-point home energy score scale.  Similarly, they found that final home sale prices were 0.4% higher for every $100 of decrease in the home energy scores estimated utility bills. The OSI staff did not find any reports that specifically investigated the impacts of the home energy scores on BIPOC, lower income, disabled, or older adults.  We did, however, meet with multiple peers in other communities to discuss how they created safety valves in their program to ensure they weren't placing an unintentional burden on especially low-income and BIPOC households. And this is how we landed on, first, the waiver program in the ordinance, second, hiring a full-time staff member to offer the assessments for free,  And third, aligning our energy rebate programs to be offered through the Community Climate Action Millage with the various categories of improvement identified in the Home Energy Score reports. So question three, how does this help Ann Arbor homeowners, landlords, and developers participate in the Attainable Housing Facilities Act, the Residential Housing Facilities Act, and or the Neighborhood Enterprise Zone  OSI staff were not involved in these programs. And given the last minute nature of this question, we were not able to coordinate with other departments to get a response. If council desires, we can follow up with colleagues in the community services and others as needed to get a response. For now, though, these are not programs that OSI administers and therefore we're unable to provide detail about the city's involvement.  Question four. How exactly is this different from DTE's Energy Audit Program? Can a chart that includes what's included in each audit and the certification process to become an auditor be provided? Are there any Ann Arbor or Washtenaw County-based auditors or program partner organizations that train the auditors for this program? The DOE  develops the home energy score. And the home energy score requires very specific data points to be gathered during an assessment. The score is based on things like the home's envelope, which is in basic terms, the separation between the inside and the outside. It's like the foundation, the roof, the walls, the windows. It also includes HVAC systems and water heating.  Basically, the higher the score, the more efficient the home, but beyond the score the home energy score report includes specific recommendations on how to improve the score with projects that have an expected payback of 10 years or less.  The energy consultations offered by DTE are quite basic in comparison to the home energy score. While the DTE consultation may provide some simple energy efficiency products, it lacks the depth of information that can provide a homeowner insights on any major changes to the home.  And yes, there are existing auditors trained to conduct home energy score assessments in our community beyond the one being hired by the OSI. And the OSI is planning to offer free training for other energy assessors that are interested in becoming certified assessors. Question five.  Why is this program instead of helping owners become zero energy homes, why this program instead of helping owners become zero energy homes through grants and no interest or low interest loans based on income. There's also the Home Improvement Expert Program and Clean Energy to Communities Program. In  In addition to the herd ordinance, we are developing programs that will help residents make improvements in their homes and businesses. These include rebates, rebate programs that are currently being designed in the OSI. However, a homeowner or a business needs to know what improvements are needed in order to make a strategic decision about their next upgrade.  Having the home energy score provides that information and can simultaneously help OSI ensure that we are directing the limited taxpayer dollars that we have to the highest impact investments. So to put it another way, the OSI is strongly considering having residents get a home energy assessment before they can apply for rebates. In this way, we'll be able to ensure that residents are getting matched with the right incentive to make the biggest impact on their bills, their health, their safety and the climate.  We're also working on a home energy advisor service to help people make more strategic decisions and to connect folks with additional rebates and incentives to make improvements. And those recommendations will be based on a home or a business's assessment. And finally, we wanted to note that Ann Arbor did win a Clean Energy to Communities program award, which is a technical assistance grant that we are currently working on in collaboration with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.  Question six. Though the DOE is sunsetting their Energy Star program due to the BIL and IRA provisions, the EPA lists six upgrade categories that could be incentivized that would cover most of the previous question. Why place an extra financial burden on homeowners after passing the 20-year $6.8 million a year millage, which is $120 million in total, that they are already paying?  Why not use an incentive-based energy assessment that provides property tax credits for homeowners who voluntarily perform a certified assessment and ongoing credits for those who make improvements?  This is a good question. As to the requirement versus an incentive discussion, the OSI is taking the yes and approach. We're doing both. We are offering incentives. And we are seeking a requirement. And that is because according to research published by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory,  and incentive-based programs have little to no effect on the desired outcomes of HERD here locally. LBNL examined over 26,000 home sales that occurred after receiving a home energy score.  And among the many findings was that only in the cities where the home energy assessment was required to be disclosed at the time of listing, did they experience a positive market impact. Places with voluntary home energy score activities showed no statistical market benefit.  And we are using the community action millage, the climate action millage to fund the energy assessor and the additional market capacity to offer these assessments for no cost to the homeowner. So in essence, we are using the climate action millage to support this program.  Question seven, as real estate associations contract out with third party for their MLS have you spoken with rapid Tony the company that maintains the listings to find out the logistics and timeframe of adding this extra category.  No, the OSI did not speak with Rapitone directly, but instead we used the National Association of Realtors Guide, known as the Green MLS Implementation Guide. This guide was designed to help MLS staff implement certain fields in the MLS that are dedicated to information about a home's efficiency. This guide offers technical guidance, best practices, and a whole lot more to make the process as smooth and as easy as possible.  Thanks for hanging in there. Just a couple more here. Question eight. Was Laura Orta, Director of Organizational Equity, consulted about the ordinance? If so, what were their recommendations and concerns and how was that addressed? Director Orta was not at the city when this ordinance was created. However, we have shared the ordinance with Director Orta and await their feedback.  Question nine, which realtor companies were consulted during the decision making process for implementing this program and how are these conversations initiated and conducted?  In the drafting and reviewing process of this ordinance, OSI staff met with the Ann Arbor Area Board of Realtors, Reinhart Realtors, I'm going to Howard Hannah tomorrow, as well as a number of individual realtors, many of whom, but not all, are either an eco-broker or hold an NAR Green designation, for instance.  Because these individuals met with me on their own time, I won't mention which agencies they were with, because I don't want to inadvertently misrepresent their agencies. But these, all of these conversations were in large part initiated either by myself or other OSI staff. Some of them were at the request of agencies who heard about, heard, and wanted to learn more. Some were in person, some were virtual.  But the goal was always to gather information about the real estate sale process and to better understand the relationship shared between Ann Arbor real estate agents and their clients. We use these conversations and other publicly available information published by the Ann Arbor Area Board of Realtors and the National Association of Realtors, as well as others, to contextualize the information that was shared with us by other communities with similar ordinances in place  to make this herd ordinance make the most sense for Ann Arbor. These were the additional questions that came in today, so thank you for your time.", "start": 6130.452, "end": 6971.932, "Transition": "\"\"", "Meeting Section": "Other", "Speaker Role": "Other", "is_public_comment": 0, "is_public_hearing": 0, "is_comment_start_trigger": 0, "is_comment_end_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_start_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_end_trigger": 0}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_20", "text": "Thank you.

Thanks for that introduction too. Covered a lot of ground. So I serve as liaison to the Energy Commission, so I just wanted to say, respond to kind of a couple of things that I felt had come up during public comment. Obviously this was something that, this is an ordinance that has been recommended by the Energy Commission. One of the critiques that I,  think that we've heard both in public comment and some of our communications is that Homebuyers are not going to make these improvements and obviously, you know, we have some data about what comes what happens in other communities But I do think that we need to note That this is a priority for our community We know that from our a to zero plan that from the 2018 inventory 23% of our emissions come from residential buildings We have a carbon neutrality goal  to be carbon neutral by 2030. That is an ambitious goal and it is going to take a lot of work for us to get there. We have residents who have supported a climate action millage demonstrating that this is a priority for them. They base that, we have our carbon neutrality plan that had  The engagement of 68 public meetings, 66 partnership organizations, and in that, the goal of reducing our emissions in our residential buildings is clearly stated as a goal. We know that up to 80% of energy consumed in buildings at times is wasted.  So, it's going to take a lot of different strategies for us to get there. This is not the one action that's going to help solve that, but it is part of the puzzle. The reality is that when folks move into a home, if they are armed with information about  with an energy assessment about how they can make improvements. They go out and want to make an improvement to their kitchen while they're beautifying it as well and bringing it up. They can also address the fact that there actually isn't insulation in that wall. I know that when I had an energy assessment on one of my homes, a place that I moved from previously, I learned that there was  Zero insulation on one of the walls. They just forgot Apparently so, you know It's it's really important information for people to have walking into a home And we are going to be there every step of the way to help make it easier for them to make those improvements So I hope folks will support this tonight Councilmember Harrison Councilmember Watson", "start": 6979.248, "end": 7140.109, "Transition": "\"\"", "Meeting Section": "Other", "Speaker Role": "Other", "is_public_comment": 0, "is_public_hearing": 0, "is_comment_start_trigger": 0, "is_comment_end_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_start_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_end_trigger": 0}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_06", "text": "I have a couple questions, I believe for Dr. Stoltz.

So the home energy score is, it's a regulated score by the U.S. Department of Energy. So what that means is we actually have standardization in both the training of assessors and in the information that's collected in these reports. And so that's different than going out and having someone do kind of this broad energy assessment. There's actually requirements for what has to be included and adherence to that home energy score. That gives us more rigor in the information that's coming back  We also anticipate doing spot checks of the scores for sure to see what's coming into the marketplace. And I'd add one other thing that you didn't ask about, but I think it's important to note. While today we're talking about the requirement for these scores to happen at time of listing,  We are actually working to have the entire marketplace get one of these assessments, because the ideal is when someone calls their realtor to say, hey, I want to list my house. The realtor's first question is, have you gotten your home energy score yet? Go do that. And if they say, yeah, I got it a year ago, that's still good. Check. You've hit that marker.

This is funding that would come back to residents to make improvements in their home. This was promised in the Inflation Reduction Act.

So in a dream world, what would happen is the local rebates that we're going to be administering through the Community Climate Action Millage would be stacked with the state's rebates to go further to help people make improvements in their homes and in their businesses.  We are a little ahead of the state and the timeline for that. So we are working really, really closely. We're helping the state put in their application, but chances are very high. This is slightly parallel to the conversation, but chances are very high that we will be rolling out our rebate program first locally until the state is ready, and then we will sort of stack on.

So there's kind of a few different prompts to that, and I'll go quick. One is the Home Energy Advisor service that we're piloting right now in 14 homes, that's also offering this assessment. And so that's another kind of track. The intent there is a lesson learned from Denver, who has a similar climate tax, it happens to be a sales tax, is that when they offered rebates, they found that people went for the biggest rebate they could possibly get, whether or not that's what they needed.  So an example would be heat pumps. People were applying for heat pumps when actually what they needed was air sealing. And so this allows us to be really surgical and making sure we're getting people the right improvement to improve health, safety, greenhouse gas emissions, etc. So the Home Energy Advisor is another track that's going to be working in the marketplace.  The second kind of piece, and this is not holistic, but a piece of it, is our AmeriCorps members, which will be coming to council for approval. That grant, which we did win, should be at your next meeting. The idea there is that's a ground game.

I also want to thank staff for all of the work that they put into  keeping residents safe, trying to respond to the emergencies that come in after these storms. But I also just think it's really important for us to have this data in terms of being able to make necessary improvements. I think we always should be looking for data to find out where there may be more efficiencies that we can have or other focuses that we can take to make sure that we're responding.  I also want to just call special attention to the final bullet point in the resolve clause because it also requests an estimate of the total emergency costs incurred by the city. And I think that's important because we know that as each of these storms, these storm events occur, that there is considerable cost to the city.  Not all of that is just an emergency response because there was a storm. A lot of it is an emergency response because we have prolonged power outages at a time when we need to keep people warm, when we need to keep people cool, when we need to respond to sparking wires. And so I think it's really important to know we know that every one of these prolonged power outages comes at a cost to our city. We know that deferred maintenance costs by DTE are  are exacerbating those costs. And so I think it's really important for us to have an idea of what those costs truly are. And I will also note again that there is a federal FEMA report that indicates that two major storm events, the cost incurred by those ultimately would pay for burying power lines. We are at three major storm events this year alone. So I will once again call on DTE to  to seriously start looking at burying power lines and improving their infrastructure in our community. Yes, when there are major storms and there are high winds, we know that trees can impact power lines. That doesn't happen when they are not in the trees. So I would call on DTE to continue to make investments in infrastructure improvements because it has been sorely lacking. Any further discussion? All those in favor? Opposed?  It passes.

I tried to work with Gulfside Lake Apartments. They granted a judgment, which on the 17th, I will be evicted from my home, me and my son. So I've lived in Ypsilanti, Ann Arbor area since 2005. I do not want to have to move. I do not want to be homeless.  I've worked with all different facilities and everything, and basically the cost of living has gone up, but the cost of, you know, the income limits has not. So it's showed everyone that I make too much money to get help.  So basically, I've never seen since 2005, I've never seen the rent be as much as it now. It's $1,600 a month, which Section 8 does help me with a little bit of it. But I'm left, like I said, I'm just one hospitalization or car breaking down away from being homeless.  So I come to you guys today just in hopes of not only Ann Arbor, but Ypsilanti, help us. Our income, we're not making enough to make ends meet anymore.

And I appreciate all the work that you guys have already done with the right to renew legislation and the openness you have already expressed tonight for tenants' rights. But I want to make sure that everyone here, and watching later even perhaps, understands that this is not sustainable. The price increases year over year are far outstripping inflation.  And it's making it harder and harder to make a life here in Ann Arbor.  Beyond even that, the price portion of things, there is the sheer lack of respect that landlords show their tenants. I know several people already tonight have come up to talk about things such as mold in their apartments. I can confirm that that is also true for my housing in the Traver Crossing complex. Things such as standing water. You run the dishwasher and  Sometimes things work out fine you watch you run the washing machine and you just know. Oh, yeah that puddle right there Yeah, it'll go away eventually And so it's just we need to make sure that tenants feel not only safe in their homes Which isn't always the case but that they feel respected and that they know that this is a place where they are welcome Thank you for your time.", "start": 13736.541, "end": 13845.693, "Transition": "\"\"", "Meeting Section": "Public Comment", "Speaker Role": "Commenter", "is_public_comment": 1, "is_public_hearing": 0, "is_comment_start_trigger": 0, "is_comment_end_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_start_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_end_trigger": 0}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_20", "text": "Thank you  That concludes our public comment overflow.

We want to know what our residents think about everything that we're doing in the course of our community. And over the many years that I've been on council, and surely before, and almost certainly after, we are going to continue with those community engagement efforts. But what we also know is that it's a privilege to engage with  engage with local government, that it's difficult sometimes to engage in local government, and that it is incumbent upon us to ensure that the great multiplicity of voices that are in and latent in our community have the same opportunity to come and engage and influence local government than had been previously the case. We want to make sure that our efforts are broad, that they're deep, and that they are truly and always welcoming.  And so we have asked a long-standing group to work together deeply and hard to effect an equitable engagement initiative and to issue our final report so that we may receive the benefit of it. And well, shoot, that's what's happened, exactly. And so I have this proclamation to this effect.  Whereas the city of Ann Arbor wishes to advance equity by developing a shared understanding of what equity means for city policies, guidelines, and practices to help Ann Arbor be a more inclusive city. And whereas demographic data collection of the past years has shown that community engagement attendees are not representative of the city's diverse population.  And whereas a 30-person steering committee was formed to represent new perspectives and to discuss how to implement a more equitable engagement strategy. These recommendations were formalized in the report, achieving equitable engagement in Ann Arbor. And whereas a multi-department team researched other communities' best practices, inventoried our current resources and practices, and facilitated with this steering committee for 18 months.  And whereas a presentation of the committee's recommendations was shared with the Planning Commission, Renters Commission, Human Rights Commission, Environmental Commission, Commission on Disability Issues, and to the Energy Commission for feedback. And whereas community engagement specialists, some of whom are attendee here, have already used the steering committee's recommendations to make budget requests and have received funding for a digital engagement hub and pilot liaison program.

I'm excited to be with you tonight to represent some of the work that's happening. I'm gonna share some screens. Just a moment. Just a quick...  Visual cue. Can you see this? Yes. Excellent. Fabulous. All right. Well, as a recap, there has been a lot that is going on, and this resolution can contain a lot of different outreach mechanisms, engagement techniques, and approaches. So this is pretty text heavy. I do apologize, but I wanted to make sure to cover where we stand.  Once again, thanks for the opportunity. The way I'm going to go through this presentation is first, I'm not going to read this. Do not worry, do not get stressed. This is broken down by each of the resolved clauses. So the first slide will be the resolved clauses that Council passed. The following slide that will demonstrate what we've done to address  of the points that have been identified. So I'll just note here, this particular action was about City Council asking us to work with the Michigan legislature to let them know our concerns, what we hope to see around energy equity broadly throughout the city. There's policy, there's education, there's some special working sessions. So in terms of where we are, and I should have said at the very beginning, I'd like to thank Assistant City Administrator John Fornier for helping me pull this together, our Fire Chief, Chief Kennedy for his assistance,  and our Director of Organizational Equity as well. You'll see lots of fingers all over our responses.  So in response to this particular one calling on us to work with the Michigan legislature, we have discussed this resolution with members of our delegation and other leaders in the legislature. And actually this fall, as we prep for fall lobbying efforts and looking at what different pieces of legislation are going to be brought forward or that we hope are brought forward, we have a special meeting. And this bill or this resolution will be centered in those discussions, especially as we focus on bills  related to sustainability and energy policy which I am actually delighted to say it looks like there will be many. So we will keep council posted as this progresses just noting that in the spring we were in budget cycle so there really wasn't a lot of movement on these kinds of topics it was very focused on budget.  In addition, staff are supporting a number of bills right now in the development and also in seeing them be brought to the floor. Those include many of the items that are addressed in this particular resolved clause. This is the advancement of community solar, expanding the authority of the Michigan Public Service Commission, which folks may not realize is actually heavily constrained by what the legislature grants them authority to do. So we are working to expand that authority.  There are bills around energy storage requirements and incentives. We're working on an increased outage credit. We're working on bills related to allowing microgrids, especially at critical facilities, but also more broadly. And there's even a bill to expand our statewide renewable portfolio standard, which we're excited to see.  and dare I even say there are bills that tie greenhouse gas emissions to actual performance in the utilities. So there's a lot of work that's happening here and hopefully we're going to see quite a bit of movement on some of these bills, if not all of them, a girl can dream, by end of this year.  The second resolve clause focused on working with the Michigan Public Service Commission. In particular, this is the regulatory body that helps set the rates and that our investor-owned utilities are accountable to. So these were the resolve clause here. A lot of this is about daylighting the concerns that we have, pushing our utilities to work significantly on reliability concerns, which I know we all feel pretty deeply every day, and then working on transparency.  which is critical for operations. So some of the things we've been working on here, we certainly have shared this resolution with our colleagues at the Michigan Public Service Commission, ensuring they were aware  of where council's pain points were, what you wanted to see as strategic opportunities. We also are formal intervenors in many cases, but I want to take a minute and point out we are intervenors in the rate case, which is the current rate case. Last Tuesday, our closing briefs were filed. Many city witnesses have had their testimony cited in public, including in the media. We see cross-referencing to the Public Service Commission staff pulling our testimony about the lived experience of Ann Arborites,  and the pain points that we have, many of which identified in this resolution in their own testimony and with other petitioners who've intervened in the case. So we'll be coming back to you as we know more. Right now, things are moving before the administrative law judge in that rape case. But we continue to intervene in cases, rape cases, integrated resource planning efforts,  voluntary programs, et cetera, to make sure that we're pushing as hard as we can in the regulatory space for greater reliability and more offerings for our residents. OSI staff also regularly participate in what are known as technical conferences with the Public Service Commission staff and utility staff. These are things that come forward either after a rate case or before where sort of the industry is thinking about big questions. So we make sure we have a seat at that table, and right now we're talking about things like  How should we be increasing reliability? Data access is a real problem right now. So what can we do while protecting individuals' data, but also making sure we have the information we need to be really strategic and surgical with the work that we're trying to do? What's the future of battery storage in Michigan? How do we get more people to adopt  energy efficiency practices, or how do we incentivize more distributed energy resources such as wind or small-scale solar, and many more things. So we spend quite a lot of time early in the process working with the Public Service Commission staff to make sure our constituents' concerns are heard and that we're representing all local governments throughout the state in this work.  We also submitted testimony explicitly arguing that reliability must be a factor considered in rate making and pushing for what's known as performance-based rate making. Excited to see that move forward. We've seen it go all ways in different states, but generally the concept here is that we believe our utilities should be compensated when they perform, not for subpar performance.  We've also submitted testimony on the outage map, which was explicitly called out as being confusing and hard to navigate in our testimony, but also in council's resolution. And then we are exploring some other pathways, including, as you know, things like the sustainable energy utility, the rebate program, direct installations to help improve reliability and resilience outside of work with the Michigan Public Service Commission.  The third resolve clause was about our own operations as a city and making sure that we're doing everything we can to include and enhance resilience and equity in our work around energy issues. So some of the things going on here, our office of organizational equity is currently looking to hire a customer service survey vendor who's gonna look at internal equity across the board, which would certainly include thinking about our energy system and the work that we're doing across emergency management or an OSI.  We continue to make investments, significant investments, in enhancing the resilience of municipal operations. That's including things like solar and storage installed on key assets and community centers. But here the idea, we can't go down. The city has to always be able to operate and provide the critical life-saving services that we provide day in and day out without disruption, especially during a disaster. So we're going to continue to make those investments. We have a lot of priority. We're doing a lot of work around this. And I'm really excited to see the transformations that are taking place.  We also are coordinating with other communities in the county and leveraging our mutual aid agreements to ensure that the support resources we need are available when we need them, and that we're also available to provide those support resources to others when they need them. And we do have monthly meetings with DTA liaisons across the organization to discuss our opportunities, our pain points, areas for work or greater collaboration. And that spans the entire organization, depending on what the topic is. Sometimes that's in the electric side. Sometimes that's distribution. Sometimes that's generation.  Sometimes that's in the regulatory space. Sometimes that's the gas system. So we make sure to cover the issues and the opportunities that are presented before us in those conversations. And we carry the agenda. The fourth resolve clause was about making sure that DT had space or inviting them into spaces to hear from the public about their pain points and what they're hoping to see broadly in terms of greater energy justice and decarbonization.  In terms of what's happened here, we are continuing. I'm sorry, I don't think I even responded. The actions are underneath here. Apologies, this is out of format for the others. We did have a GTA liaison present on August  2023 at the Energy Commission meeting. They presented on reliability, recent outages, and their plans going forward. In fact, if you're at MLive today, you probably saw reporting on that particular presentation. We also have invited staff from DT to present more frequently at the Energy Commission meetings so that both commissioners and the public have a channel to directly engage with and share their thoughts with DT liaisons as well as with our own Energy Commissioners as we're thinking about how best to advise City Council on work in this space.  And then lastly, this is sort of another category where it just authorizes the administrator to take actions to implement. But I'm using this as an opportunity to tell you some of the other things that are going on that weren't explicitly called out but are relevant to advancing energy justice, equity, and resilience. Here, of course, OSI is working on a number of new programs that you know about and some existing programs, such as our Solarize program. But we also have a commercial solar program.  We've been looking at the sustainable energy utility and there's more like the home energy rebates and the energy advisor service that are going to be coming soon. Those are really important ways that we can help the public get the resources, the tools, and the support system they need.  We do meet, as I mentioned previously, with DT, but we also have ad hoc meetings as necessary. And right now we're having meetings on upgrading our 4.8 kV system to a 13.2 system, upgrading transformers and substations so that we have more electrical capacity throughout the city, but also on key circuits where we anticipate growth happening. We have been pushing for undergrounding of wires, in particular in coordination with street projects. If we're already opening up a street, let's look at what's possible when we're doing that construction. And trying to co-design pilots for things  that to me make a lot of sense in our world, which are things like bring your own battery pilots. We have high battery adoption in our city and so we're a great marketplace to be testing kind of innovation and how those programs can be built and expanded throughout the marketplace.  We also work with the state's climate office quite a lot on statewide efforts to equitably address the climate crisis, especially around energy issues, and I didn't want that to be lost here because they're not the regulatory body, they're not the legislature, but they are sort of similarly staffed to our office and we want to make sure we're coordinating where we can.  And the last few things, there is one more slide. I do apologize after this, but we do have OSI staff that participated in an energy equity project community of practice, really making sure that we continue to think about and find ways to center equity and grow our own work in this space. We also chair our professional network, the Urban Sustainability Directors Network Energy Equity Learning Group.  And then just some other things I'd point out that may not always come in front of mind. Our 10,000 Tree Program runs a community tree planting initiative where we actually plant much larger trees in underserved, under-canopied areas. And that has significant energy savings potential, not to mention a whole bunch of other stormwater benefits, health benefits, air quality benefits, et cetera. And then we've got our Home Energy Advisor Program that just finished its pilot. We're going to be releasing an RFP hopefully later this week or next week for a third-party administrator so we can scale that.  We're looking at thermal energy networks as an opportunity to reduce energy burden, increase comfort, and enhance safety. We've also got an RFP that'll go out in the next two weeks or so for a rebate administrator so we can get those rebates from the Community Climate Action Lodge out the door. We're working on the Home Energy Rating Disclosure and the Green Rental Housing Ordinance to help protect residents from energy burden. Then of course, OSI, EM, Emergency Management, and the Ann Arbor Housing Commission work really closely on expanding resilience hubs. That includes a grant that we're exploring right now.  to add solar storage and other decarbonization techniques to almost every single housing commission community center. And then I'll just end, I don't think most people know because we haven't done a good job in OSI saying this, we just released a toolkit for multi-unit developments on how they can enhance solar and EV access because there's different challenges that they face than a single family residential homeowner.  And then we always fundraise to try to support people with making these these improvements because we know that it's not equally accessible to everyone. So thank you for your time. I know that was a lot. But the point is, there's a lot going on on this.

This is Tom Stolver calling from Lower Town in Ann Arbor. And I'm calling about CA9, the repayment of the bonds for the old Y lot. I'd ask that you pull it from the consent agenda and discuss it. The millage, you know, governmental accounting is a little bit different than regular corporate accounting. I'm a treasurer for a nonprofit, so I have to deal with some of the aspects of that.  When citizens vote for a millage, there's specific items in that language on what the money is to be used for. And there's certain expectations that come along with that. So I think it would be helpful for the citizens to hear the complexities of this issue and to understand and be satisfied or not with how this matter is being handled, how our millage money is being spent. This is nearly one year's  one full year's amount of the affordable housing knowledge that we voted in. And one of the things that was said and that our expectations were based on is the idea that we could actually get affordable housing built if we did it on city-owned lots because we already own the land. Well, if we're having to pay for that land, that starts to make that a little bit more complex. And one of the other things we talked about was  not having the units sunset, revert to market rate, because it's a city owned lot. We can control that. But there's a possibility here of building about half market rate units and about half affordable housing units. And the possibility that some of the lot could be sold. So it'd be sure nice to know, you know, if we pay now that affordable housing knowledge,  or to pay down the debt here. And then market rate housing is built with half the money come back to the affordable housing note. If the land is going to be sold, how do we know that the units are going to be there forever as opposed to some setting? You know, maybe it's all worked out, but it'd be great for the public to hear you discuss that. So I've asked you to pull from that consent agenda so we can have that conversation. Um,  I'd also like to talk about the affordable housing in general. One of the ways we get affordable housing money and affordable housing units, besides our millage, is through PUDs. And there have been PUDs that provide actual units, and a lot of them provide payment in lieu. We are in jeopardy, very shortly, of approving a development that is approved as a PUD. 30 seconds.  would provide 33 units of affordable housing. Now, I sure hope it doesn't go away that Lower Town did, where we lost 93 units of affordable housing to nothing but corporate profit. In this case, I've heard some arguments why South Town should not be approved as a PUD, but I've not heard a single argument that legally holds any water whatsoever. And it will cost us 33 units of affordable housing and great legal exposure to the city.

These photos I'm going to show you  are of a school crosswalk, a school crosswalk that's used, a school crosswalk that has been in discussion since 1996 when the city hosted a community hearing. Why do we still have a sign here that you can hardly see, and this right here shows what the crosswalk sign looks like  for the opposing traffic, and the other crosswalk sign is over here and not even legible. Now, this is not a complex problem. This is not like sustainability. This is not like all of the issues we're facing with A20. It's just a very basic process. But Ann Arbor doesn't seem to like basics. So anyway,  Got ahead of myself. I have talked to the mayor. I have talked to council members one-on-one I've entered a to fix it tickets and it's obvious that the city simply lacks the political will and operational capacity to maintain safe school crosswalks For this reason I plan to use the same model  that community members used in 2016 following the death of a student in an unlit crosswalk. Concerned citizens formed A2 Safe Transport and effectively advocated for improvements in the school walk zones. The city responded by adopting A2 Safe Transport's plan and allocating millions of dollars for crosswalk improvements, lighting, RRFBs, consistent signage, et cetera, to improve the school walk zone.  Today, I encourage community members to join together and apply for a SAC grant as a chapter of Families for Safe Streets, an established nonprofit to address obstructions in the public right of way. There are three goals. One, to create a community education program.  because most people don't understand the public right of way. In fact, some people on the planning commission don't understand the public right of way. Two, to develop a roadmap for the city, what we need to do going forward.  And I think we need to be very prescriptive because the city is still having trouble flipping crosswalk signs.

Now at 4.3.4%.  And it keeps going up, all right? Why is it going up? Because the market's pushing it up. Why is the market pushing it up? Because of inflation expectations, all right? A currency crisis is when the currency that we use loses its purchasing power. This is municipal because this applies to society, okay? This is our community that we need to step in and help. Loses purchasing power. It stops functioning. It doesn't work like it used to. And this manifests in rising prices.  And this added cost of living essentially makes everyone poor. Everything we used to take for granted is now more expensive, mainly the things we really need like food and shelter. As the currency continues to erode, life gets harder, resources get stretched, the cost of everything keeps going up. Inflation precipitates societal decline.  59% of people with student loan debt have said that when student loan payments resume next month, that they will need to make a choice between making their debt payment or buying groceries. Credit card debt is now over 1 trillion and rates keep rising. People are at the brink. This is an emergency and we need to step in and do whatever we can to help our community.  We need to reduce the cost of living for our residents. Yes, we need to reduce taxes greatly. Reduce the size of government, I'm sorry. Reduce the city's debt burden, reallocate expenditures and human resources into providing essential safety nets to help keep our people productive, happy, and healthy. We need to empower people to keep their homes.  We need to develop a self-sustainable economy based on conservation, rural production, and agriculture. We need to make sure our people are fed. So, I study this a lot, and I'm fairly convinced this is what's happening, and it's pretty scary. So I want the city to  at least consider these words and what this could mean for our future. Because I think everything is going to have to be rethought. All our expenditures, what we're doing with the money and where it's going, it all needs to be rethought before it's too late.

I'm here for two reasons tonight. One is to express my appreciation to the council for continuing to pursue reparations for blacks in Ann Arbor who have been disenfranchised over the years. And I think that you're headed in the right direction when you're talking about putting together a task force to address this particular issue. I just hope that it doesn't become an unending task force that goes on and on and on.  And eventually it dies out because people lose interest in it. So I would hope that the council would move at a quick speed to put together a task force to address this particular issue because it's a very, very important issue, at least to me.  From my perspective, it's a very important issue that blacks be reimbursed for efforts that they put into this community but have not been rewarded over the years. The other thing that I'm concerned about is reading the papers yesterday, there was a comment about maybe Native Americans should be included in this initiative as well. Well, let me be clear. I'm not opposed to any group seeking reparations for their community.  But I am opposed to including other groups into this reparation initiative for blacks, because there's been initiatives that have been stimulated by blacks in the past, and we've been the least to benefit from those. Other groups have benefited from the efforts that we put forth to bring about change for our community, but it's only benefited other communities as well. So I would be opposed to any, I would like to dip in the butter right now,  You know, any effort to include any other group in this initiative that is designed to produce reparations for the African-American community in Ann Arbor, Michigan.

My name is Ed Vilmetti. I'm here to speak on CA12, the payment in lieu of taxes proposal for a development on Stadium Boulevard on an old car dealership lot. I'm happy to see the progress to our new TC1 zoning. We'll have its first residential  option, an option that was not available before that was done. So that's a real sign of progress. I will note the challenges of building housing on what is almost certainly a brownfield site. Car dealerships are not known for, I guess,  Car-centered businesses in general are known for their pollution of groundwater and other things. There's a whole bunch of concrete on the site. There's going to be a lot of work to clear it and prepare it. And I would not be at all surprised if the Brownfield Commission or the body as a whole will have to deal with that at some point in the future. I don't have any special knowledge, but that just seems to be likely.  I'm looking forward to more neighbors on that site. It's been bleak for quite a while. Most of it was cleared. There was a building, a five-sided car dealership building, which I'm sure someone thought of as historic at some point in time. But now it's just bare and vacant. And I'm looking forward to the efforts, which I'm sure will be complicated and involve details of public finance that are beyond me to make it all work.  I will say that the city does have a history of successful transition of car dealerships to other uses, just like we have a history of transition of gas stations to other uses. And I'll point as an example to the Whole Foods site on Washtenaw that if you have a long memory, or if you don't have a long memory but have looked it up somewhere, used to be a car dealership there.  So it's entirely possible to take a site that was acres of parking and turn it into something that's a dense use. I just warn you that you may actually have to spend a little more municipal money to bring the site up to a level where you'd want kids to play on the grass.

Some questions came up regarding CA6 that were, I guess, a little kind of tangential to it, not necessarily direct with the  agreement itself with Dearborn was my understanding. The two questions, one of which kind of related to longer term fire service planning, and the other related to the relationship of fire services between the city and the University of Michigan. As with most tow and gown relationships with the university, it's a little complex. The first part is from a direct funding perspective, the city does not receive any direct payment from the university for fire services.  what the state of Michigan has, and by default with U of M being a public institution, the state of Michigan has a program where they fund money to local governments for fire protection, and it's based on a  basically an SEV of what the property is worth. Now the challenge there is what is the taxable value of Michigan Stadium? What is the taxable value of University Hospital? So the basis of the funding mechanism itself is I think challenging at best because  U of M creates that number for us. We don't create that number. So that number is done outside the assessor's office. So that's the initial challenge. For the last several years, what that equals to is about 10 per the state reimburses the city, or reimburse might not be the correct term, provides funding to the city, which is about 10%. So for fiscal 23, it was 1.9 million.  And again, that is a state of Michigan program, not a direct U of M program. And there is a formula that's used is how that is generated. The second part that is more informal, and we've tried extensively to find a formal contract with this, and one does not appear to exist, is the relationship of the city and Fire Station 5. Fire Station 5 up on North Campus, that is a U of M owned building. It's on U of M property.  Since the late 60s, the city has operated a fire station out of there. They provide utilities, we provide the truck and staffing. So the station is desperately need to be renovated. It was at a time where women firefighters didn't exist and it is the oldest station that we have city employees currently operating out of. So that's the  I guess the fiduciary between the city and university. In terms of fire staffing with density and development, both in the downtown and with the university, some of those issues were covered in the fiscal 24 planning. One of the biggest issues we're dealing with is the density and the vertical growth in the downtown.  the need to add what we're kind of terming as a high-rise unit, basically a second unit downtown that can help address some of the vertical challenges. Fighting a fire on a one-story, 1,500-square-foot house is a lot different than the 10th story of a student high-rise. And so that's an upcoming challenge. There's initial vehicle costs with that. And then to staff that with 24-7 coverage, that would be a 12-FTE.  Request in and we're estimating that probably north of 1.1 million for a recurring cost We're also seeing an expansion of our ambulance transport unit, which was authorized by council earlier this year We're continuing to monitor that that's also a Definitely a horizon challenge and then a lot of the facility challenges that have been addressed mainly the replacement of station for on here on Parkway, so those are a couple of the  horizon issues that we expect with fire services.", "start": 2999.048, "end": 3251.976, "Transition": "\"\"", "Meeting Section": "Other", "Speaker Role": "Other", "is_public_comment": 0, "is_public_hearing": 0, "is_comment_start_trigger": 0, "is_comment_end_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_start_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_end_trigger": 0}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_12", "text": "Thank you.", "start": 3251.976, "end": 3252.537, "Transition": "\"\"", "Meeting Section": "Other", "Speaker Role": "Other", "is_public_comment": 0, "is_public_hearing": 0, "is_comment_start_trigger": 0, "is_comment_end_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_start_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_end_trigger": 0}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_29", "text": "Thank you.

So we're not really a department of the city, but we're a city created entity that was created specifically for the development management of affordable housing. So even though we're a separate public body corporate, we are a component entity of the city. And so it would be similar to asking a different department besides engineering to do engineering work. So we are that part of the city that is tasked with doing this work.  As far as the city keeping ownership versus selling the property. This particular site and other sites, this particular site has a long history of city acquisition, RFPs, developers, failed developments, RFPs that went south. And so it is a  I think for the city to maintain ownership as the developer, just because of our history of having a hard time getting sites developed, working with the private sector, projects tend to take a very long time. They can take five to seven years, and there's constant change in the political feelings of council members, of the community,  And so if we actually really want to get a project developed, it should be put into the hands of an entity that's not the city.

That's just the reality and what we're hearing from the private sector on the risk of doing development in general in the city of Ann Arbor, particularly when the city maintains ownership.

In all these activities and others, including the latest Ann Arbor Planning Commission publicized notice, recommended R1A.

I consider a Blanket R1D zoning an inappropriate and would like City Council to respectfully consider Properties 2775 and 2737 Newport Road be changed to the original staff recommendation of R1A with the following reasons.  It's consistent with the present land use element of the comprehensive plan and R1 zoning. It's consistent with the surrounding zoning of R1A in the city, but also R2 in the township. It's a smooth transition from township to city density, as these are the first two properties coming into the city.  These properties on Newport Road are on or very near a dangerous curve. Accidents have occurred. To have that small corner be built out to 12 dwellings on a 1.7 acre lot would increase the likelihood of an accident with limited sight lines and it's irresponsible. Council might also consider parkland for the Rudolph Steiner property.  as there is already a 1986 memorandum of land contract which includes an easement in favor of the public for the use of existing and future exterior playground and nature areas on the premises.  R1D will drastically increase the impermeable surfaces on the hilly terrain from the present percentages. Existing rain gardens on the school property help control water quality, retention, and detention. The township and the city have a water sewer agreement.  There is a water T valve on the west side of the Steiner property to be used in the case of emergencies to provide water to the adjacent township properties without being annexed into the city.

I live on Newport Road in Ann Arbor. I work in commercial real estate, so I've been before councils like this, usually asking for a zoning change or a variance. But when in those positions, I've worked with city officials to ensure that our goals are aligned and that changes are in keeping with the surrounding areas.  Never have I witnessed municipal spot zoning indiscriminately like we're seeing today, especially against the will of the actual parcel owners. While I understand the directive to increase density, there's a right way and a wrong way to do things. And I feel that this is clearly a wrong way to do it. My family and I moved to this area  about six years ago because of the lack of density. The larger lots that make up the area, land around us had already been developed in a thoughtful, consistent manner. There was nothing to indicate or feel that our area would change. You know,  The extreme zoning change that we're talking about here today will negatively impact the quality of life for the people in the surrounding area. As alluded to previously, Rudolph Steiner is the largest parcel that's up for spot zoning today, and they signed a petition against that zoning change.  When these, and again, while it was mentioned previously, when these properties were annexed, the point was to join with a R1 zoning designation, not an R1D zoning designation. By changing it to R1D, it completely contradicts the essence of that approval and of that recommendation.  The anticipated zoning change from R2 to R1A is already increasing the zoning density from one house per acre to one house per 20,000. So it's already doubling it. Now we're talking about going to almost nine homes per acre. It's completely out of touch with surrounding areas.  Additionally, not to my knowledge, again alluded to before, there haven't been any traffic impact studies done. There's been no watershed, no environmental impact studies done, which would be required if a developer brought this to you, right? You would say, show me all these reports showing that someone's not going to get run over, that environmentally it's sound.  You know, but none of that has been done, not to mention the fact that there's easement rights on the property. The biggest property that you're trying to include density on, you can't even do it because there's easements already on the property. I think in general, it just shows a lack of forethought that was done in this. It's sort of a system wide, just increased density. And again, sort of not what we're looking for in this area.

I came tonight to ask you to zone 2775 and 2737 Newport Road as R1A for several reasons. The people, the wildlife, and the heart and soul of the city itself.  Ann Arbor is a place that has the benefits of a city while being in nature. Since the pandemic, cities such as San Francisco have been extremely threatened, existentially threatened, with work from home workers leaving and moving out to places that are less expensive and more rural. In San Francisco, property values and tax revenues have plummeted.  Apartments lie vacant, businesses such as local coffee shops, hair salons, clothing stores, and grocery stores have closed, and everyone from business owners to landlords to janitors who once cleaned these now-closed businesses to the city itself that is now collecting far fewer taxes has suffered. It is widely believed that that city will never fully recover. So far, this hasn't happened in Ann Arbor, because Ann Arbor is lucky enough to be surrounded by trees.  to be a city that feels like it's in the country. If the city starts zoning properties to have higher density of housing, it will lose this appeal and people will flee. They will work remotely somewhere else, buy coffee somewhere else, buy books and groceries somewhere else, and the city will cease to exist as we know it.  In the short term, schools will be overcrowded. Taxes will go up to pay for the extra services, for the extra citizens, and there will be congestion on the roads. In the long term, the schools will be empty, property values will go down, and we will likely never recover.  As for the wildlife, I'm sure that you are aware that there is an overpopulation of deer in Ann Arbor, and they are sick due to a lack of food and natural predators. Human development caused this problem. The denser the human population, the worse it will get. Not just the deer, but other animals and native species will be killed off, and those sorts of changes tend to have disastrous effects on the environment as a whole.  Currently, there's an informal wildlife and conservation corridor coming down the hill, starting at Skyline and going to the river. This runs through these properties. A zoning of R1D would stop this daily animal movement with the potential of causing irreparable damage to the ecosystem.  If properties like 2775 and 2737 Newport Road are rezoned for a higher density of housing, the essence of Ann Arbor, what makes the city desirable to live in, what makes it a place that draws people here and encourages them to stay will disappear. Wildlife will get sick and die and people will abandon the city. Those who will ultimately pay the price will be the lowest income workers who won't have businesses to work in and the city itself.

I'm the owner of 2737 Newport Road. I think the last time I was at City Council, Jerry DeGreek and Kathy Kosashenko were on council. So it's been a while.  Anyway, I'm new to the neighborhood. My property is on the very north edge of this district. I love the rural feel of Newport Road. I've been taking care of neglected property there for the last couple of years, cleaning up the woods, and appreciating all the wildlife that currently live there. And they're allowing me to be there on occasion.  I agree that R1D is not appropriate for my lot or the school next door. Increasing density to some extent might make some sense. I could see R1A or maybe R1B.  That kind of density is just not in keeping with the neighborhood where all the lots are about half an acre. This would just increase density beyond what makes any sense from an aesthetic or safety standpoint.  I would say that it's in my financial interest to just go along with R1D, but I don't think that my financial interest is the most important consideration in this situation. So I respect my neighbor's concern for  increasing density beyond anything that makes any sense. So I just want to say that even as it is, I'm fairly new to this area. It's a major biking route. And people, you can't  There's no room on the side of the road even for bikes to get off the road when cars are coming. People can't walk there either because there's just no sidewalk. So increasing traffic in this area is really something you've got to think carefully about. The speed limit on Newport is 25 miles an hour. I was driving 28 miles an hour recently when a car pulled around me crossing the double yellow line going about 45 miles an hour on a hill.  and just passed me, and I've seen people speeding there all the time. It turns out this particular car was a delivery driver taking groceries to Barton Hills for Costco. So we already have a traffic and safety problem, so I don't really think we should make it any worse.  Also, I think the school is a beautiful property. By zoning this in a way that gives the school an incentive to sell out to a developer and move further outside of town because they could get millions of dollars for their property, it just doesn't make any sense. So I'd like to see the, at the very least, planning reconsidered.

Hi, this is Alex Lowe calling in from Southeast Ann Arbor. I must say I'm mildly disappointed with this ordinance, as I've already expressed to Planning Commission, but intend to express here again.

Single-family homes on half-acre lots in the city, forcing people who don't have half a million dollars to drop on a two-bedroom house further from the city are exactly the sort of out-of-touch flaunting of wealth that led to the US being the largest contributor in the world to climate change. If someone has the money for that,  That's one thing. When we say, no, you're not allowed to do anything else, that's a problem. Why are we bringing in things where we're not allowed to build duplexes or triplexes? Why do we continue to create new property that we zone to only allow single family houses  on enormous lots. It's ridiculous. All of these should be allowed to have quadplexes by right at minimum. And if nobody on that street wants to do that, well, then nobody on the street has to do that.

And again, I do want to thank staff and council for listening to our concerns and really going through the ordinance itself and making some changes to it that do make it practical.  But I also want to point something else out that two weeks ago when staff was reporting, they brought up a really interesting point that was based from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory study. And as I researched into that, I found a couple of other studies. There's a lot of information on this topic. I'd like to read from one particular quote. This is from the Behavioral Perspectives on Home Energy Audit Study, also by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.  And it reads, despite success stories, the results of home energy audit programs overall have often been considered disappointing. Relatively few households undertake audits, and when they do, upgrade recommendations are often not acted upon. And though there is clearly remaining technology potential, little has been proven about the overall energy savings that results from audits and resulting upgrades.  nor the extent to which actual social behavior can reach technical potential. And I think the point is that this reinforces what the Portland 30-month report showed, and that was that buyers simply don't make upgrades and changes based on having an audit in hand. They're tapped out. Here in Ann Arbor, our average selling price year-to-date is $630,000.  up $30,000 from a year ago. Prices are climbing. When someone buys a house, they're all in. They've spent it. They really don't have dollars to put into it. And then also, the way that we're looking to implement this really has a tremendous cost. We're hiring a staff assessor. When we look at the expense of that staff, all in with  their benefits and such. When we look at contracting out for peak times, which probably will be at least half of them would be the assumption during those peak months, they're just simply not going to be able to do it. You look at administrative costs, technology costs, going back out in the end and really the enforcement side of it. This is well more than a $200,000 a year  venture into doing these 1,300, 1,400, 1,500 homes a year. So I would really just simply say that there's got to be a better way to do this.

My name is Patrick McVeigh. I'm a real estate broker and a manager of the Reinhardt Realtors office located at 2452 East Stadium Boulevard. I'm here to speak in opposition to the Heard Ordinance. I certainly do applaud the city's efforts to advance environmentally conscious and sustainable housing. I fear that the ordinance as currently envisioned sacrifices that goal in exchange for what is going to possibly create an unequal playing ground for the residents of the city of Ann Arbor.  In order for the ordinance to achieve its stated purpose, I believe that there are two assumptions which we need to take as true. One, that the purchaser of a piece of real estate is willing to pay a premium for a higher energy score home. And two, that that premium outweighs, is greater than the cost of pursuing those improvements that are going to be required to get that higher home energy score.  What homes are going to be able to take advantage of that playing field? Well, it's going to be the homes with higher earning income family members inside of that home. And as envisioned, the city ordinance would have a city employee operating within a city framework.  come and inspect a premises, not to give a pass-fail, as we might see on a building inspection or a building permit type inspection, but instead a valuation, a sliding scale number that is going to ostensibly add value or detract value from a particular piece of real estate.  So I have that baseline concern. Beyond that, I would call the council's attention to section 8604 of the ordinance which discusses several types of real estate which would not be subject to the ordinance, namely 8604.1. It's difficult for me to understand what this section is talking about. I cannot tell if it is related to the sale of one building  containing multiple units, or if it is related to the sale of a single unit, which is in a building configuration that would be stacked vertically. If it is that latter situation, it would create some incongruous results in certain neighborhoods. Take the Ashley Mews condominium development, for example. That's a condominium development that contains units which are both stacked vertically and adjoining laterally in a townhome configuration.  Under the current ordinance, to me, it would seem that some of those unit owners would be obligated to comply, whereas others wouldn't, despite their same relative voice in that condominium association and ownership rights within their units. Also, with respect to 8604-4, it broadly accepts commercial buildings. I don't see commercial buildings defined anywhere.  within the ordinance or elsewhere in the city code that is being pointed to. And then 86045 broadly exempts the same categories of real estate that would be exempt from the Michigan Sellers Disclosure Act. I'm not sure why that would exist. If we're going to have an independent third party come in and assess the property, the Michigan Sellers Disclosure Act relates to disclosures that would be required based on the personal knowledge of a seller. If we're not involving the seller in making this disclosure, I'm not sure why that's in there.

So we are asked to rezone 11 city-initiated annexed properties on Newport Road, Bird Road, and Victoria Circle from TWP Township to R1D. I want to thank everyone who participated and came for the public hearing. We've heard some very thoughtful comments about R1D. Many of them have focused on concerns about things that you feel could be lost.  It is very important to say that nothing will change on any of these properties unless they are sold and developed. Zoning itself does not change anything. It doesn't force any change. Now, it is true that planning staff recommended R1A, which is consistent with the surrounding properties. Planning Commission and City Council have discretion to reconsider staff recommendations in light of policy priorities.  Both R1A and R1D restrict development to freestanding single-family homes. As you have heard, the most significant difference between them is that R1A prevents you from building a home on anything less than a 20,000 square foot lot. That's roughly half an acre.  And R1D lets you build a single family home on a 5,000 square foot lot. To require half an acre as a minimum lot size for a single family home is a barrier to entry into this community.  Many people who live in Ann Arbor see this half acre minimum as a relic of a past that they no longer endorse. The resounding support for the affordable housing millage suggests that R1D is more in line with residents' values, priorities, and aspirations today.  Again, that does not mean that this rezoning will change anything. It will not, unless people choose to sell or subdivide their properties. Now by far the largest of these occupied properties, 2775 Newport Road, is owned by the Rudolph Steiner School and houses their lower school campus, which is enrolled to capacity  by students from preschool through eighth grade, and they have wait lists. R1D zoning will have no impact on this property unless Steiner sells it and it's developed. I spoke with their director, Dr. Owen Cruz, and I quote her. We have absolutely no interest in moving at all. We plan to be there for many, many years. In other words, no plan to sell. Gerald Alkin, owner of 2737 Newport Road, was here and spoke for himself. He would not take advantage of the additional density this zoning provides.  So let's turn to the vacant properties. There are two vacant properties, and if they were developed, the community would see at most 13 new single family homes on 5,000 square foot lots. One of the parcels is a roughly one acre parcel that could accommodate a maximum of four homes. It would be max two if zoned R1A. The other is a parcel north of 2118 Victoria Circle.  Commonly owned with an adjacent property that has a home on it if housing were developed on this property Ten homes are possible, but eight to nine are more likely given the constraints of a pond on the property It would be maximum four or five if zoned r1a. So councilman zoning this Designation makes it possible to create just six or seven more homes than r1a Further discussion", "start": 5964.149, "end": 6161.602, "Transition": "\"\"", "Meeting Section": "Other", "Speaker Role": "Other", "is_public_comment": 0, "is_public_hearing": 0, "is_comment_start_trigger": 0, "is_comment_end_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_start_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_end_trigger": 0}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_29", "text": "All in favour?

Thank you so much for the opportunity tonight. We have, I believe, five questions that were submitted. So the first question, if a person owns five properties and sells all of them, but doesn't disclose the herd assessment for any of them, they will owe $4,500, correct? That is correct. Herd penalties are 500 for the first offense and an additional 1,000 for each subsequent offense. Question two,  Wouldn't a city-employed building inspector already have the first-level certification for a HERS auditor? Could they receive training to become the auditors, or could the city hire additional inspectors and pay for their training?  response. The HERD ordinance requires a U.S. Department of Energy or DOE home energy score, which is actually different from a HERS rating. The OSI, as we've shared before and you heard in public comment, is hiring a full-time energy assessor to offer free home energy score assessments. Additionally, the OSI is prepared to subsidize the cost of training for non-staff assessors, as well as for staff, if they were interested, to become home energy certified. And we're prepared to work with the private sector marketplace to bring more assessors on during periods by demand.  Question three. In the current ordinance, it looks like the only revenue is if someone doesn't complete a herd assessment or disclose. Is that correct? Response, that is correct.  Question four, if the city were to perform hers assessments as part of new construction and renovation inspection instead of during a real estate transaction, would it be possible to get any energy tests like lower door tests or help with upgrading low scored items donated for homeowners who make up 60% AMI, have disabilities or seniors through a public private partnership pilot or zero energy home upgrade fund run by the city or as part of the community benefits agreement response?  New construction must adhere to the state's building code, whereas existing buildings do not. The HERD ordinance before council is about disclosing a home energy score on existing buildings, so we just want to differentiate. To the question about new buildings, right now the state of Michigan is considering updates to both the Michigan Uniform Energy Code and the Michigan Energy Code. OSI staff and many collaborators are working hard to ensure that we have a statewide energy and building code that protects public health,  safety, general welfare, and of course, our climate. If adopted, these codes will ensure that new buildings are much more energy efficient than what we currently have on the marketplace. However, since the building code is not relevant to existing buildings, OSI staff believe the H.E.R.D. ordinance is an important element of our landscape to ensure people live in safe, healthy, and affordable homes regardless of if those are new homes or existing homes. Put another way, the H.E.R.D. ordinance is only one piece of the ecosystem of work to protect consumers and help improve the energy performance of our built environment.  In addition to HERD, we have our work on the State Building and Energy Codes I just mentioned before. We have the Energy and Water Benchmarking Ordinance, which already requires multifamily and commercial sites to disclose annually their energy and water usage. We have the Home Energy Advisor Service, and we have the soon-to-be-released Residential Rebates, as well as the Solarize Program and numerous educational activities that we work on. Additionally, OSI staff are and will continue to explore options to further support residents, especially those making 60 to 80 percent AMI or less,  One such resource is the Inflation Reduction Act, which provides unprecedented financial assistance to all U.S. homeowners for efficiency and electrification upgrades. The tiered benefit structure starts at 80% AMI. The local rebates coming through our local Community Climate Action Village will take these IRA benefits even further.  And additionally, the OSI has already piloted two programs to provide homeowners with technical assistance and guidance for improvements. Those include the Aging in Place Efficiently program, designed to support older adults, and Home Energy Advisor program, I know we've talked about recently. Additionally, the OSI is already preparing a resource hub to help residents access these incentives and assistance programs when they become available. So these will stack with the herd, not replace it.  And fifth question, what in the ordinance is written shows that we are a data-driven city? How will we track the number of HRSA assessments if they go through a private provider? Not all real estate transactions go through a realtor, but all new builds and non-minor renovations do go through the city. The response, the OSI will easily be able to track the free assessments because they will be provided either through the OSI's on-staff assessor,  or through a contract with one of the local firms that we employ. For any assessment that's done outside of those options, as well as those done through those two options above, the ordinance requires homeowners to submit proof of their home energy score to the OSI director prior to listing or during the listing process. This allows OSI to track all compliant assessments and relevant scores.

I know that for a lot of Energy Commission members, for a lot of community members who have been engaged in this from the very beginning, it's frustrating to continue to see this process slowed down, particularly when we have so much work that still lies ahead of us.  But I know that Dr. Stoltz and her team, you know, she's here with us tonight, but Zach Wasmith, who's been working on this considerably, have been putting a ton of effort into this.

So one, they didn't see it affecting housing prices yet, but two, they said we're going to have to keep watching this on the question of is it adversely impacting minority communities. But the other point that was made is  sometimes we're gonna need this information to figure out how to target our subsidies. So if we don't know that people's homes are rated a one in efficiency, we won't know that they need subsidies that they're eligible for.

Second, as we've mentioned a few times, this is not the only thing that we are doing. This is but a piece of the ecosystem and it's an important piece because it's data.

We don't have enough money to help every single household make improvements, but we really do want to center our  our frontline and fenceline populations, our low-income communities who've been disproportionately burdened by energy costs that are rising, or other sort of factors in their lives.

We're not just, I know we're talking about this because the ordinance itself is focused on time of sale, but we also are hoping to offer this and what we will be offering this.  in some way, shape or form, assessments for everyone in the marketplace to get their home energy score. Once they get a score, they're good for eight years or until they make major changes to their home.

It's about a finding in the study by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. And so this is their 2022 study based on over 26,000 home sales. Among their findings, as we have mentioned a few times, was that only in cities where the assessment was required to be disclosed at the time of listing was there an impact on the market.  And they found two impacts on the market. One was that a one-point increase in the home energy score in these locations was associated with a 0.5% increase in the sales price. So that's good for the seller.  but they also found that an increase in $100 of estimated annual energy bills was associated with a 0.4% decrease, which is not good for the seller.

While we have been proactive in addressing biases through our ordinances and resolutions, there exists a limitation with the Court Law Enforcement Management Information System, otherwise known as CLMIS.

This system currently only allows our officers to select one reason for contact and only one outcome from a list during a stop, leading to potential discrepancies in our data, which in turn can undercut the very intent of our past initiatives.

By allowing our officers to detail the multifaceted nature of each stop, we ensure that our data is as comprehensive and reflective of reality as possible.

I do note that on your agenda today, you have approval, second reading, for three new commissioners for ICPOC.  And we believe they will make excellent commissioners. We've gone out and grabbed people and said, the people that we thought would be helpful. We have another one coming probably at your next meeting. So hopefully we will be at a full complement very soon. We are still looking for a youth member. So if there's any one student, we're looking for a student, U of M, EMU, Washtenaw Community College, to fill that spot. We have a lot of work.  to begin doing this fall. I have spoken before, and I'm going to speak again about our public forum that is coming up. It's going to be Wednesday, September 27th. I've heard from a couple of you, and I hope that you will accept our invitation to attend. You know, our ordinance  charges that we are to create an environment which allows for better communication, understanding, and relations between the department and the community. So we're hoping that we have police officers come out. We have asked Dr. Karpiak to come and give a more extended presentation than he did here. And there will be a time for questions if anyone does have questions about that traffic study.  We've asked Councilwoman Harrison to come and give a few words about the driving ordinance, driving disparity ordinance.  Equality Ordinance. And again, there'll be time for questions and answers and discussion. And we're gonna ask the community, we may get five community members, we may get 55. We don't know, we haven't tried this before. But it is an opportunity for folks to come out, talk with us, not just ask questions, but tell us what they want. As I've said before, we are your only commission with the word community in our title. And so we do intend to try and involve the community.  That is basically all that I have. I hope to see some of you on the 27th. We're going to be at the Peace Neighborhood Center. And we are grateful to Commissioner Billups for allowing us to meet at that venue.

And it is time for us to take a stand for fairness and equality and the rights of all individuals, including those with disabilities. You see, sub-minimum wage is often referred to  as the practice of paying individuals with disabilities less than the federal minimum wage. And it is not discriminatory, but perpetuates a system of inequality. And it undermines the dignity and worth of those individuals working hard with a disability and denying them the opportunity to fully participate in the workforce and contribute to their communities.

It's such a pleasure to be here. My name is Jessica asthma. I am both the wheelchair user and the founding director of an organization called Detroit disability power and I want to thank the clerk and the city council for inviting me today.  It is a great honor to be in the company of folks like Zach Damon and Councilwoman Aisha Ghazi-Edwin to support the Disability Voting Rights Week proclamation. This is something that is important for raising awareness and I want to give you a real brief story about why that is. I mentioned I'm a wheelchair user and that I started the Disability Justice Organization.  And a lot of that has to do with my experience as a regular, excited, enthusiastic voter. Many times when I have gone to vote in my wheelchair, I have struggled to do so. I actually live in Detroit, not in Ann Arbor. But what I have learned over the years is that the challenges around accessible voting are not in a singular place, but very common throughout the country.  So back in 2018, I went to vote in my wheelchair. I was very pleased to get into the building to get my ballot. And then I turned around to figure out where I would go fill it out. And there was absolutely nowhere that I could reach from my wheelchair. All of the booths were standing height, and there was nowhere for me to vote. And when I turned around to ask the woman who had signed me in where I should go, she didn't have an answer. And while she was very kind,  She clearly, no one there, had clearly thought about, oh, what do we do if a wheelchair-using voter comes in today? How do we accommodate someone who moves through this world differently? And so after a few minutes of consulting each other, they cleared off the table in the back. I was able to vote privately and independently. That night, I happened to have an advisory meeting of my organization, all of whom were other people with various disabilities.  And as I shared the story of what happened, each of them shared similar stories. These are blind people, people with cognitive disabilities, other people with mobility disabilities. But every single one of us had a story of a challenge voting. Fast forward, very important election of 2020. I showed up to vote. I wanted to use the accessible voting machine. I apparently was the first person that day to ask to do it.  No one there at the precinct knew how to turn it on or what the code was. I waited about 45 minutes while they played phone tag with the others in the headquarters of the clerk's office. And at the end of the day, I was able to vote on the voting machine, but they couldn't tabulate my vote because the paper was a different size than what normally goes in the tabulator from a paper ballot. So I actually left that election not knowing if my vote counted.  And again, it just reinforced that there are lots of different ways that problems can come up on election day, but none of them are unpreventable. Both stories I just told you could easily be solved with a little more training and preparation. And so in 2022, my organization, Detroit Disability Power, worked with the Carter Center down in Atlanta to do a massive audit of Metro Detroit polling sites.  to determine where the accessibility problems were. And while we didn't come to Ann Arbor, we focused on 15 jurisdictions in Southeast Michigan, and the results that came back were very troubling, although not surprising. Of those 261 polling sites that we audited on election day in November of 2022, only 16% were fully accessible.  And so when we look at this data, we know that that means that voter turnout of disabled residents is lower than it should be. We know that people aren't able to vote like they should and are entitled to, and that we have some work to do. And so we are working with very cooperative clerks like yours to ensure that we're  fixing the problems, especially the low hanging fruit problems. There's many of these problems that don't cost money to fix, but also tackling the harder problems like the infrastructure that needs to be altered to make sure that people can get in the building and vote.  So this report is available. It's also, we have lots of briefings and workshops to learn how to make these polling places accessible. There's a lot more I could say about that, but what I'm really here to say today is that I'm very excited for this proclamation. Disability Voting Rights Week is a great way to raise awareness about these things, and I appreciate the time and attention that you're putting towards it.", "start": 815.212, "end": 1106.402, "Transition": "\"\"", "Meeting Section": "Public Comment", "Speaker Role": "Commenter", "is_public_comment": 1, "is_public_hearing": 0, "is_comment_start_trigger": 0, "is_comment_end_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_start_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_end_trigger": 0}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_28", "text": "Thank you, Ms. Cosma.

My name is Elliot Carter. I am a limited license social worker who graduated with my MSW from University of Michigan 2020. I work for disability network Washington member Livingston and I and my organization  Support the passing of Resolution 23-14-69, directing the city administrators to advocate for the Michigan legislature to end the use of 14C certificates in the state of Michigan. Disability Network originally formed as the Ann Arbor Center for Independent Living almost 50 years ago, making us the fourth oldest center for independent living in the country. So much has changed for people with disabilities since 1976.  For starters, lifelong institutionalization is no longer the ever-present threat to people with disabilities that it was, and Americans are much more accustomed to the idea of people with disabilities living full, independent, fulfilling lives, including working the same jobs that non-disabled folks do. Employment opportunities for people with disabilities have increased exponentially with the help of technology and state, federal, and workplace policies.  but an 85-year-old policy is still holding people with disabilities back from full inclusion in the workplace. And this is Section 14C of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. I'm sure it's becoming increasingly clear to the honorable members of this council that the state minimum wage of $10.10 an hour is not enough to get by in the city of Ann Arbor anymore, but it is still legal for some people to be paid less than $1 an hour in Michigan thanks to this policy.  A business, community vocational organization, or educational institution can apply for a federal waiver which allows them to use a convoluted formula with virtually no oversight to pay people with disabilities based on their observed productivity on the job. People without disabilities do not need to have their productivity measured to determine their wages, so why is this still the case for people with disabilities?  The arguments for keeping sub-minimum wage are often effervescent of the shortcomings of other government policies designed to keep people with disabilities out of poverty. And it is true that these policies often require people with disabilities to monitor and report their earnings and assets in order to keep receiving assistance.

I'm calling in support of D.C. 's three resolutions to improve data transparency and performance management. I want to thank the authors and sponsors and make honorable mention to John Murphy, who would never want credit for it, but has been years championing city goals that are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound, otherwise known as SMART goals. I appreciate that this resolution highlights the importance of transparency and performance management,  and direct federal implementation process begins. And for people following along as home performance management, according to the Society for Human Resource Management, it's defined as the process of maintaining or improving employee job performance through the use of performance assessment tools, coaching, and counseling, as well as providing continuous feedback.  The last time I addressed Council in person was exactly a year and a half ago on the night that the City Administrator was hired. At that time, I encouraged you to start working on your most important job, evaluating the City Administrator. I recommended doing so intramurally on a quarterly basis with perhaps a more formal evaluation on an annual basis. To my knowledge, in the intervening time, not one Administrator or City Attorney evaluation has been done.  I hope that adopting this resolution sets Council and staff on a path toward accountability and achievement. In order to be effective, though, I believe this resolution must be expanded. I have three suggestions. One is to agree on goals. The resolution makes reference to key performance indicators, but lacks the suggestion of what the key ones are or how to determine them. This should not be left up to staff. Only Council can answer this question, and you should begin a process to determine which ones you really care about. What success looks like  and a time frame that's achievable. For example, are there any outcomes that you care about so much that you would give the city administrator a poor performance review if he didn't achieve it? I hope each of you can think of at least some, and then you can come to consensus on many of them. I want to know what those are, and I'm sure many of the people in the community do too. I hope that in the next budget cycle, it will be clear where money and staffing should be allocated. Number two, start basic evaluations now.  Performance management is critical and it's something that shouldn't wait until this process is complete. Please begin evaluating the administrator or at least the general criteria that have been used in the past. Direct the administrator to begin quarterly reviews of senior staff and reboot council working sessions to get updates from senior staff and give you and the public the opportunity to ask questions. Three, finally set a timeline. I find it ironic that this resolution repeatedly emphasizes accountability but itself fails to mention any timeline.  Please give staff a deadline to pull together a one-pager on current versus best practices in performance management and data transparency, and work out a rough timeline for achieving the rest of the steps in your resolution. Please start the accountability now. I want to add that putting the prioritization and dashboard process in place, which will take several months, is not an excuse for continuing the lack of progress on critical issues like zoning and housing, and the backsliding on loan safety.

I'm calling in today with mixed feelings about DC2, the traffic calming program. On the one hand, this is a good start. And I really appreciate that it really is a good start. But on the other hand, it reads to me as quite timid and honestly insufficient.  First, I'd like to see the inclusion of an explicit mention of life-saving pedestrian and bicycle safety devices followed in the list of speed control elements. As despite being a part of NACTO guidelines, the city appears entirely unwilling to do the trade-off of  some potential damage to a car that has left the roadway in return for the enormous benefit of not killing someone. Frankly, I don't see how this is a hard decision. Bullets are all over the rest of the world, and within the US alone, I have personally seen them in Los Angeles, San Diego, Chicago, Nashville,  and even in our own backyard in Detroit. In fact, I looked on Google Maps and double-checked with some articles, and as it turns out, our city's number one rival, Columbus, Ohio, has real bollards, not just flex posts, at their OSU sports complex. We're really gonna let Columbus beat us? One such location, where bollards, especially removable ones, would be a huge improvement  is the new State Street. If we aren't willing to make this area the permanent pedestrian plaza that it really should be for the safety of everyone, we should be, at minimum, be willing to protect people, be they on foot, in wheelchairs, on bikes, on roller skates, from multi-thousand pound metal devices hurtling  Additionally, this resolution should be a bit more authoritative when removing the requirements of Council approval for traffic calming projects. That's a great start, but any street maintenance that includes vertical elements or resurfacing should be required to include traffic calming and safety measures. 30 seconds. And not to include elements  like sidewalk level crosswalks, pedestrian-protecting by-laws, and protected by-cans should require staff to report why they have chosen not to include them.

I was dreading coming out today. I just returned from 10 days in Incline Village, Nevada, but  I found the speakers both entertaining, informative, and I agreed with most of what they said. So this is great. It seems like young people are starting to agree with me or I'm starting to agree with them. Anyway, the theme of my talk tonight is unintended consequences. Sometimes unintended consequences are just inconvenient. But as a prior speaker mentioned, sometimes they result in death in a roadway.  Regarding traffic calming, I think it's absolutely critical that we look at the unintended consequences. If we are putting traffic calming on one street, we need to look at the parallel streets. And that is something that Sam Schwartz recommends, Sam Schwartz, a consultant who did Vision Zero,  There's an excellent example of what they did with the busway on 14th Street in New York City. So we need to be more methodical in our implementation and consider those unintended consequences. Next, we need to look at school crosswalks. I brought this forward at the last meeting, and I was really concerned about overgrown vegetation, because that's one of my pet peeves. But the first three people I showed it to said  Why isn't the crosswalk marked? It's like, I don't know. And then I checked and the crosswalk design guidelines, which we spent considerable time on, definitely specifies that it should be marked. And so, again,  and unintended consequences, we overlook this. And when I went down there today, I counted over 50 cars that were parked along this area, including right through the crosswalks, because I don't think parents even knew it was a crosswalk because it wasn't marked. My last area is that we are wrongly charging people and endangering pedestrians. And one example is the corner of Beaks  Kingsley and Main Street. There was a greyhound bus driver who hit a pedestrian. I've gone down there, I've looked at it, other engineers have looked at it also. It is humanly impossible to see a pedestrian in that crosswalk because there is inadequate lighting at the crosswalk and there are bright globes that the DDA put in just beyond that. So you're looking at a glare  and you can't even see a pedestrian there. So I hope that you will implement safer crosswalks.

This is Tom Stolberg calling from Lower Town in Ann Arbor. Calling about CA11. And like other people, I'll pick a theme. My theme will be expectations. And I talked about this last time this was a council, that the citizens when they  voted for the affordable housing millage had certain expectations. And some of that expectation was based on the language of the millage. Some of that expectation was based on things like putting affordable housing units on the old Y lot, which has been talked about for a long time. One of the key reasons that we were gonna have city-owned lots that we already own made available for affordable housing  to keep the cost down. So the expectations were not necessarily met when we had to find out how much money had to be spent to buy the lot that we already own. This is all covered the last time. So I understand where we're at with that now. And there may be good uses for the rest of the money. But again, expectations. Citizens should have a discussion of why the rest of the money is going where it's going, even if it's a good reason.  Because we voted on a village, we have certain expectations of that. While we're talking about affordable housing, we have certain expectations. There's 93 people that we are not housing because our citizens had our expectations broken when the city improperly, illegally approved the lower town plan. 93 units or $9 million of affordable housing that was lost.  And a PUD in disguise, the exact same plan. It's built as a PUD, and there's no reason it wasn't built as a PUD except to avoid 93 units of affordable housing. There's 93 people or more, because it could be more than one person per unit, that are not going to get that affordable housing. Later on tonight, we're going to talk about 33 people, 33 units of affordable housing that you're ready to give away, benefiting private interests,  and not following the law, yet again. When we vote the affordable housing bill, we also had discussion about 415 West Washington and not using Miller's money there because that site didn't qualify well for affordable housing in terms of tax credit and other federal reasons, because slugs laying next to the tracks, et cetera. 30 seconds. We've broken those expectations. And we're going to use a PUD there  It's kind of inconsistent when we say PUD to pay when it's not okay. We'll use a PUD there to put money into a payment in lieu, and then that payment in lieu is just going to get taken off the top, and we're going to get net zero money for affordable housing at 415 West Washington, in part because we didn't follow the expectations that were set.

This is Brandon Dimchuk from West Larrytown and Fourth Ward. I'm calling tonight to thank the sponsors of DC2 and to request that you approve this resolution. Our neighborhood has been frustrated by speeding drivers for years, and while some of our streets have received traffic calming, the existing process for having your road calmed is incredibly cumbersome. Streamlining this process and making it automatic during major road work is a great improvement. Furthermore, this model of choosing safety by default should be applied to other road work as well.  I noticed, for example, the recent Packard resurfacing left the lanes excessively wide, didn't buffer the bike lanes, and actually decreased safety by removing the gateway treatments at crosswalks and the green paint in bike conflict zones. It would have been nearly free to make safety improvements during this project simply by painting slightly different lines on the road. We should not leave opportunities like this on the table. DC2 will help fix this in neighborhood streets, but we definitely need some better defaults elsewhere too.  So, once again, please approve DC2 and consider expanding this to the safety by default concept to major roads in a future resolution.

Also wanted to use my time here tonight to say a few words about minimum lot sizes and its role in land use reform This is on my mind for two key reasons, you know at our last meeting we approved zoning annex township parcels to a single-family zoning category with a minimum lot size of 5,000 square feet and Then last week councilmember iron I had the chance to meet with the team the consultants that are helping us with the comprehensive land use plan  So I think land use reform is one of the most impactful tools that a city government has to influence housing availability, housing prices, as well as the livability and sustainability of our communities. And minimum lot sizes as a regulatory tool  sets a floor for land costs. So large minimum lot sizes of 5,000 feet became pretty standard in post-war suburbs. They've resulted in driving up housing prices and mandating a spread out development and sprawl, because fewer homes can literally be built in a space. Not to mention excluding residents that cannot afford the amount of square footage that is required.  This might make sense in rural township environment, because there's an argument made that you need a large lot to accommodate septic fields and wells for drinking water. But for Ann Arbor, where housing prices continue to skyrocket and we can't meet our housing needs, I think we really need to apply a critical eye to mandates that basically force lot sizes much higher than 5,000 square feet.  So the recent annexing decision, you know that provided a small opportunity to look critically at this regulation and I hope that we continue to look at this as You know, we'll embark on the comprehensive land-use process.", "start": 2659.319, "end": 2802.923, "Transition": "\"\"", "Meeting Section": "Other", "Speaker Role": "Other", "is_public_comment": 0, "is_public_hearing": 0, "is_comment_start_trigger": 0, "is_comment_end_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_start_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_end_trigger": 0}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_28", "text": "Thank you Councilman", "start": 2802.923, "end": 2806.266, "Transition": "\"\"", "Meeting Section": "Other", "Speaker Role": "Other", "is_public_comment": 0, "is_public_hearing": 0, "is_comment_start_trigger": 0, "is_comment_end_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_start_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_end_trigger": 0}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_05", "text": "Thank you, Mayor.

This Sunday, there is a GFS Walk a Mile in My Shoes event in support of refugees. We are expecting 18 additional families coming to Ann Arbor by the end of this month.  They'll be the Sunday at Burns Park Elementary from 9 to 1. I will be there as a board member. A note about the Black Asian Solidarity Picnic. This came out of a tragedy three years ago where a Vietnamese American man had shot a young black child in Ypsilanti. I'm really heartened to see that the conversation has moved  From what is safety to what is community and reflection on our shared civil rights work? With community leaders and community organizers and our children. So we bring our children and we have good food And it's it's a tradition.

I think Pittsfield Township outpaces everyone else in Washington County when it comes to housing units. September 6th, tomorrow, there's an important meeting.

There's a meeting for with the county the county urban executive Committee is meeting at 2 p.m. Virtually and this is allocating four point five six million from the home investment partnership  our American Rescue Plan funding allocation. So previously, a draft plan had gone out zeroing out the dollars for affordable housing, and now there's, it looks like there is an allocation of 40% of that going towards affordable housing. Please voice your support to ensure that that actually comes through. The facial recognition ban work continues.

My name is Tom Renker, and I'm representing the Ann Arbor Area Board of Realtors. And I'd like to just kind of start out and thank you for letting me speak and kind of voice our concerns. We talked a couple of weeks ago, we talked a lot about the time that's been spent on this, that the Energy Commission has spent many years working on this. We shouldn't be doing this for the Energy Commission. We should be doing this because it's the right thing to do. Realtors have been working on this for a long time.  Our first meeting with the Energy Commission was in June 2018, more than five years ago. And out of that, two members, two realtors became members of the subcommittee of the Energy Commission, Jack Brown of Howard Hanna and Chrissy George of Trillium Real Estate.  They worked with the subcommittee many times. They did research work. They contacted other municipalities. They contacted other association of realtors. And the findings of that subcommittee were that, yes, great things come out of this. There's some wonderful statistics and data that comes out of these reports that are very valuable to the city itself. But in the end, there was truly no measurable results.  that the buyers, after they received these reports, did nothing with them simply because they couldn't afford it. Like here in Ann Arbor, we talked about this last time, average sales price year-to-date, $630,000. Buyers are tapped out. They've spent it. And true, there are incentives available. They can get $1,000, $2,000, $3,000, $4,000, but to get those incentives, what do they have to spend? Buyers are not going to go further into debt to actually make this happen.  So we're sitting here today saying that we're going to force sellers to do something they don't need and will never use by doing the audit. And we're going to have the sellers give it to the buyer. And true, the buyer will have some use for it up front. They'll see another estimate of what it might cost. They may be able to use that number to say, you know, is this good or bad? If I'm looking at a house that's a one and one that's a five, it gives me some negotiation power. Maybe I choose the five. Who knows where that five's going to be.  But the point is, is that we're forcing someone to do something that they don't really need to do, giving it to someone that won't use it. It just seems like a real waste of some considerable funds that we're going to spend $200,000 to $300,000 a year with the way that this is currently structured. We look at staffing, all in expenses. This is a big expense.  Let's find someone that will actually use these reports. You have thousands of people every year that are putting together building permits, they're hiring contractors, they're a perfect source for an audience for whether it be a forced or whether it be an offering to actually use this type of an ordinance or use this type of report for some real value.  So I would ask you to really think about this, that, you know, what we're planning to do is not going to help us reach our 820 goals. I mean, Jack and Chrissy, ultimately, they were never asked to come back. They were told they would. They weren't because they basically were told that what they were saying wasn't really in their best interest.

One of the hats that I wear in the real estate business as a buyer's broker, I do not ever represent sellers, only buyers. So my clients would not be paying for this report. They'd be the recipients of this report. My clients now get  a home inspection. The vast majority of the home inspections that I have had experience with would call out the low-hanging fruit, best thing for your buck, energy efficiency items when inspecting the home for my clients. If my clients are doing work after they've made the purchase, they're most likely to do  the most cost-effective, lowest-paying food, best bang for your buck improvements. They've already been told what those are. A comprehensive report might have some impact for the people who would be more aggressive about the improvements that they would make in their home after they buy it, and that would be a good thing indeed. But the vast majority  in my personal opinion, in my professional opinion, the vast majority of the items that would actually get done are already being identified. I would much rather see this amount of money from our climate action millage be spent in achieving reductions in carbon rather than producing reports that may not be adding any value.  or the value may be greater low compared to what value is already out there. I would like to see people who aren't necessarily selling their home, but who would be a good beneficiary of our climate action or energy improvements to their homes, get the money to actually make those improvements instead of  the money going to inspections and reports based solely on the sale of homes. I don't think we're identifying and targeting the best bang for our buck on our limited funds for our climate action millage. In terms of equity and the tax money. Again, expectation.

I am Margaret Posher. I'm the managing member of Prentice Partners of Ann Arbor LLC and South Town by Forum LLC. Based on the most recent campaign of misinformation that has found its way into the zoning proceeding, we find it necessary to clarify the ongoing use of 830 Henry Street and the issue of Airbnbs in our developments.  In a planning commission meeting held late in 2018, we described the planned use for 830 Henry as being for, quote, young professionals, graduate students, and recent grads. The motivation behind this use was simple, to create a place where this cohort could create a foothold in Ann Arbor as they launched a new job, a new enterprise, or the next stage of their professional education. A great deal of research supported this strategy.  830 Henry passed its certification of occupancy in early 2021. While COVID was the justification for many businesses to completely change their course of direction, especially those that required people to be in close quarters, this use plan was not abandoned. Having made the commitment at Planning Commission to house young professionals, graduate students, and recent grads, this continued to be the 830 Henry occupancy focus.  Sometimes these occupants stay for weeks and many times they stay for months. This commitment included digital tools to attract and invite individuals and startups that fit the use plan. At the end of the day, we realized because of consumer habits that the best method to attract occupants was through the Airbnb booking platform. Simply put, this platform is used for far more than vacation rentals.  and people are using it more and more for longer term rentals. 830 Henry still uses its own digital tools to book occupancy. The vast majority of occupants are U of M graduate students, professors, athletes, and coaches, as well as new startup teams. I don't believe that at the 2018 Planning Commission meeting, there was a great deal of concern about what technology would be used to fill the units.  I think the concern was, would this development support the housing needs of Ann Arborites? Per current regulation, this means people who live in Ann Arbor for 31 days or more. Some 830 Henry occupants stay for less than 31 days, and many stay for far longer. I would ask council members not to get caught up in hot button terminology, for example, Airbnb, used by people who are trying to run council from the outside.

My name's Heidi Posher. The South Town Sustainable Energy System will set a benchmark  for sustainable building construction and ongoing clean energy production at a state, regional, and national level. Sustainable benefits of the Southtown project relate to a built environment constructed to optimize energy efficiency and the activation of occupant participation in programs to reduce and preserve energy.  The project incorporates renewable on-site energy generation, as well as a microgrid designed to coordinate all of these components into a holistic, sustainable energy system. Southtown is designed with enhanced carbon lifecycle building materials that include mass timber, a building envelope that accounts for solar and heating patterns across four seasons, a geothermal system that exchanges heat between the building and the site to greatly diversify the impact of HVAC load,  and green rooftops to avoid the creation of heat islands. The bedrock of the sustainable energy system is Southtown's microgrid control system, which will manage and reduce campus load and optimize the integration of the sustainable energy resources to targeted objectives. This is so, so important because it provides a level of control that almost every building doesn't have.  These objectives, these targeted objectives include reliability, as in the ability to disconnect from the grid when necessary and allow the occupants to shelter in place, as well as net zero emissions. Under this design, it will actually be possible to run the entire development as a carbon negative footprint. I really want to emphasize that. The objective of the Southtown microgrid design is 100% uptime and carbon negative operation  completely eliminating the 3,600 pounds of CO2 emissions that pollute our environment with every megawatt hour of electricity that's delivered. We can do this while still preserving an all-electric campus. Ann Arbor's a clear leader in municipality-driven  sustainability in the United States. Southtown presents a unique opportunity for area residents to live their strong commitment to curbing climate change in the most meaningful way possible. I'd respectfully ask council to make sure that we're not distracted by other issues and we're focusing on what really matters here.

And particularly one aspect of the new zoning that I was concerned about is the offsets of zero, there's a zero.  No inches of offset is required under the new zoning. The home that I owned prior to moving to Ann Arbor that I owned, I lived in Boston before coming here, but I owned a property and lived in Manhattan before then in a neighborhood called Turtle Bay.

One of the reasons the developer is seeking rezoning is so that they can put short-term rentals on the site. I'm sorry if the developers object to us talking about those things, but it's true. Okay. As we know, our city is in dire need of affordable long-term rentals for our residents, not short-term rentals for visitors.  The current zoning would not allow these short-term rentals because the city has ruled that non-principal residence short-term rentals are not allowed in residential neighborhoods. The developer is trying to use rezoning to put in short-term rentals, of which they already own many in our city. They say they will limit the number of short-term rentals in South Town,  But this rezoning would open the gates to more short-term rentals in the area. Please do not approve this zoning, this rezoning. Speaking of zoning, the consultant for the comprehensive land use plan was to start on June 1st.

Hi. Yeah, I'm really excited about  more housing being built. I'm excited to see the energy efficiency be part of this.

It's easier to heat and cool them.  It's easier to provide water and power to them than it is to the single family homes per person on a per person basis.

My name is Kathy Borris. I live at 1726 Charlton in Ward 5. I am going to borrow some words from a former planning commissioner to say that in my opinion, rezoning the proposed South Town development from R4C to C1AR is exactly the opposite of what we want.  Why is this so? For a rather simple reason. R4C, the current zoning of Southtown, does not allow short-term rental non-principal residence as a primary use. I'll say that sentence again. R4C, the current zoning of Southtown, does not allow short-term rental non-principal residence as a primary use. But C1AR does.  In fact, as one of the conditions of rezoning, the developer has offered that Southtown will contain no more than 30% short-term rental. Furthermore, if Southtown is rezoned to C1AR, it is likely to set a precedent. That means that the city would risk a lawsuit if they were to deny the petitions of future developers seeking a C1AR rezoning in this area.  All of this could lead to the South Town areas becoming a sort of air bed and breakfast land. Is this what we want for our city? No, it isn't.

This is Tom Stolberg again. I have written you at length about some of the legal issues here. I want to echo what one of the gentlemen who spoke in person said, that the sustainability aspects of this project are laudable.  However, that really is not the zoning issue at hand here. C1AR is not appropriate. It was designed for the campus. It was this distance, not nearly anywhere near anything called campus. The words are getting butchered a little bit. But C1AR is designed as a downtown zero setback type of zoning. It's the most intense zoning at the D1.  We have what's before, I'm sorry, there's another development called Five Corners that's from State, Packard, and Art Street. That is in the Campus Business District. There's a map that shows what the Campus Business District is, and that's in it. And they're asking for a PUD. So now we have a few blocks of R4C south of there, down to South Town, which is asking not for a PUD, but for CBOE and AR. PUD would solve all the problems  that I identified in the legal issues here for Southtown without creating legal jeopardy for the city and creating a very hard, the city was very hard-pressed to turn down a C1AR application along State Street across from, not the campus business district, you know, where McKinley and Dewey are, but the athletic complex.  With all those athletic buildings, would that not be a natural place for short-term rentals to pop up? Well, the nature of conditional zoning is, if you approve it for one person down at South Town, it has to be voluntary. So the next person wants to see where they are, and they don't have to ask for the limits at 30%. They can stand mute on any limits of height or any limits on the number of short-term rental units.  It has to be voluntary. You can't make them add those on. So if their application is otherwise valid for CWIN AI,  If you turn them down, you're going to get sued, and you're going to lose. That's the real-world situation. So you know at this moment in time right now, you're opening yourself up to that legal jeopardy. Now, you said when it came to by-right developments that you didn't even want to hear them. You wanted the site plans to be heard at planning positions and not come to you because of a similar issue of you turned them down, and they were by-right, you'd get sued, and you'd lose.

First of all, I just want to echo what several other people said. I think the C1AR zoning is totally appropriate on the site and I think it's also worth noting that the staff report unequivocally said the same thing.  So I want to talk about short-term rentals for a second. I think this whole short-term rental versus long-term rental thing is a false dichotomy. We have demand for both in our community. There are a lot of people who come to Ann Arbor for very laudable reasons, and they need a place to stay while they're here. Sometimes they need a space to stay while they are searching for long-term housing because our housing market is so problematic. The truth is that  We actually need on the scale of tens of thousands of new housing units in our city to meet the demand that we have. While what we're talking about, last I heard we have maybe a few hundred short-term rentals. So short-term rentals aren't having a massive impact on our housing needs. But also, I've long been pretty frustrated by the city's habit of putting all of our hotels out on the periphery of town in extremely car-dependent areas. I think that people visiting our city should have the opportunity to properly experience our walkable community  And, you know, something that we're proud of, rather than feeling obligated to bring even more cars into it. Now, shifting gears a bit, I honestly, I sort of feel it's a little bit problematic that the developer felt obligated to offer all of these zoning conditions at all. I mean, maybe it's good that they did. Maybe that will make your job easier tonight. But  we seem to be in a habit of requiring every development to have a tailor-made and heavily restricted zoning district, either a PUD or by telegraphing that we want all of these voluntary conditions added, which is this really the definition of voluntary? I don't know. In any case, this is no way to achieve the scale of change that our city requires to solve its most urgent problems. Again, like I said, tens of thousands of housing units.  So I don't understand why see when they are is something that we're approaching with such reluctance here, it's a zoning district that could allow this project and could allow others like it to be constructed by right. A suggestion from some folks seems to be that we need more zoning districts that are more persnickety and restrictive about what 30 seconds.  I think that's dead wrong, and I hope that this is something that will get addressed in the future in the comprehensive planning exercise. But in the meantime, this conditional rezoning is what's before you. I think it's an excellent project, and I hope you'll approve it.

Remaining unaddressed from the conversation so far is the issue that the conditional zoning requested. It's clearly the type of conditional zoning that the courts rule against. And why they do is very important  to both the zoning and the site plan issues. Two of the conditions, one the height and the other the set short-term rental issue, they serve the applicant's private interests because the existing status quo, the current zoning, has a lower height limit than that condition and totally bars non-primary residence short-term rentals. So the comparison that's being done in the analysis here  is incorrect. You need to be comparing it to what the status quo is. No short-term rentals that are non-primary residence. And a height, I believe, what, 30 or 40 feet for R4C. Not comparing those limits to the proposed zoning district that's being requested. So they're actually getting more, not less. These are not limits beyond  what's currently allowed, the limits to what's currently allowed, they're actually more than what's currently allowed. So this is really being measured incorrectly. Now note, the conditional zoning say on electrification, that's high. So in evaluating both the zoning and the site plan, you need to relook. The planning reports are not correct. The comparison is not being done correctly.  And you have to reject this. Now, PUD would resolve those issues. You have a legal remedy available to you. We recall back to the Garnet, which came before council, again, with conditional zoning that was inappropriate. That was turned down.  and came back as a PUD and approved as a PUD with the exact same site plan. So this exact same site plan.

Despite what others may say, the site plan should not be developed as a PUD. Assertions of the contrary are simply incorrect. The proposed site plan conforms with C1AR entirely with the minor variance granted by the Zoning Board of Appeals. The variance was granted in order to allow the developers to provide a free public plaza about the size of the library lane surface parking lot.  without going over the allowable building size. A fully conforming site plan here would just be worse because we wouldn't get the plot in space. The conditional zoning from the previous hearing simply restricts the developer and any future developers from hooking the building up to natural gas, adding more parking, or using more than 30 percent of it for short-term rentals. Those conditions are  not bad and do not require an otherwise conforming site plan to be developed as a PUD. PUDs are for out of the ordinary developments that can't be built in an existing zone.

TC1 is a new transit corridor district that we are,  Applying the long existing transit corridors The goal of it is to facilitate encourage and support redevelopment and infill development to realize mixed-use projects and achieve affordable housing enable more housing choices more sustainable forms of development and reduced resource energy needs and Our first quarter to rezone was Stadium and Eisenhower then came Stadium which is  what precipitated these questions around amendments, and then next in line are Plymouth and Washtenaw, hopefully. So along Stadium, obviously we had these, this is a slightly different area where we've got more residents and a nice mix of locally owned businesses.  But one of the things that became clear during that process and one of the reasons we asked for these amendments is became clear that we cannot do things like TC1 currently prohibits car share. It prohibits car rental. So if we're trying to encourage folks to live car light lifestyles or car free lifestyles, it's nice if they choose to do that to be able to  in close proximity of their homes be able to walk over and go to a car share and Check out a car for the day, but currently that is not not permitted. So as folks have rightly noted from callers Unfortunately, the UDC combines car sales and rental in our uses and I think that's something we might want to address moving forward Because at the point of these amendments is not to encourage car dealerships fortunately, the amendments would be by special exception use so everything would go in front of  Planning Commission for review before it would move forward the other piece the other amendment that this brings forward is the ability to do Car repair which folks may say why would you? Want to have car repair and an area where we're trying to do less car centric Become less car centric  What we know is that services in close proximity to where people live allows them to walk and bike more. So even in the case of car repair, this is something that people can, if they own a car, they have the ability to go drop it off and then walk home, bike home. So I'll give the example, for the example of my father. He lives in apartments right behind Stadium. He has  chronic health issues, disability. And when he needs to go to get his car repaired, he's going to take it to a locally owned shop just down the street. And instead of calling one of his family members to then drive, go get him and then take him back home and then have us go back home, which you can imagine all those different car trips, what he's able to do is walk home. And so, you know, even in this situation, what we're doing is actually enabling less car usage.

And in addition to some of the points that Council Member Briggs has just made about people being able to live relatively independently and access services that they need for their automobiles,  during our transition to fewer and fewer automobiles, I would mention that the circular economy is pro-repair. And that does really need to include automobile repair. So this is partly, I think, what we're having is a philosophical discussion. And I think for some of us,  We would like TC1 to be leading the way without cars and with pedestrians and with bicycles. And I love that vision, but I think that we are actually in a transition. And so I think that we have to  recognize that people will be hopefully having one car per household, maybe giving up cars and having car shares, but I don't think that we can legislate cars out of existence next year. And so I am okay with the things that are here. I also think that it's important to say that the existing form-based standards in TC1  make it, I believe, safe to permit limited automobile-related uses there. So we have setbacks, we have other pedestrian-friendly features, we have limitations on surface parking, and surface parking can't be between the road and the storefront. I think those things mean that we may get car-related uses that are more palatable.  And finally, I want to say that without making this change, there are existing auto-related uses on these TC1 corridors. Of course there are, because they're at the periphery, and so that's where auto-related uses have been. If we do not make these amendments to TC1, the existing auto-related uses become non-conforming, which means that they are frozen the way they are, because they will not be significantly updated until they pass out of service.  So we would rather it is possible. I don't know how likely but it is possible that these places could be renovated before they pass out of service to be more aligned with our TC1 goals. We rule that out if we render them non-conforming.", "start": 7054.362, "end": 7215.364, "Transition": "\"\"", "Meeting Section": "Other", "Speaker Role": "Other", "is_public_comment": 0, "is_public_hearing": 0, "is_comment_start_trigger": 0, "is_comment_end_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_start_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_end_trigger": 0}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_07", "text": "Thank you, and thank you to my two colleagues who've already spoke about this. I, too, when I read this, it hurt my heart to read car sales as part of this because I think our minds immediately go to exactly what we don't want to see in this corridor. But I see this as very much reflective of growing pains. This is something we want to encourage, and we want to be a model for the city in terms of how these transit corridors work.  And I do think, you know, one, to underscore what Councilmember Briggs said, that currently the UDC doesn't distinguish between car sales, car share, you know, and we do want people who want to have a car light lifestyle to have access to a vehicle when they need it. There are times when you need to drive.  and making that easy for people to do and to wrap their head around and to remove the fear around being in an area where biking and walking is encouraged. I think that's an important part of our infrastructure and acknowledging what Council Member Dish said as well is we have to accept that as part of reality, but we also need to encourage the behavior that we want as well by building that infrastructure.  I think the second part of it around the circular economy is that allowing people to repair their cars and not have to hop into a car or take three different cars or get multiple cars to go and drop off their car, that just seems silly to me as well. And so the ability for people to maintain their vehicles for as long as possible I think is really important. And I think it's a financial consideration as well. If you can fix your car versus having to buy a new one.  I think that's an important thing for us to think about when we when we go through this Do I think that as this is stated right now is the end-all be-all?

As I said in the last meeting, I'm one of the people that co-sponsored the initial resolution that got this work going, so I wanted to acknowledge that and also say that I still support addressing the existing narrow rights of way, even though I won't be supporting the addition of auto sales and rental.  I saw a perfect example of the narrow rights-of-way today on Stadium that drive-through bank is going up and it is right up to the narrow sidewalk and it just was a reminder to me of once again of like how oppressive feeling that is especially as we want to allow  other modes of transportation in that corridor. But I digress. Like I said, I won't be supporting this. I think our primary aim in these corridors is increasing mixed uses, encouraging high density, encouraging alternative transportation like bus, walking, biking, et cetera, and discouraging auto-dependent and auto-oriented uses.  I understand the argument that's being made about having things in a walk's reach of where people live. I personally depend on my bike to get around. My husband has the car all day in East Lansing, so when I need a car, I have to rent one, and I do have to go to a distance to get a rental.  But I still think that number one, there's absolutely no reason that we need auto sales in these districts. And number two, if the aim is to encourage folks to travel by bus, which I didn't hear anybody say, bike or foot by building more density in these corridors. And I think we need to make way for those uses that are more consistent with the same. And that includes housing, grocery stores, cafes, workplaces.  I also noted the response that we got from staff in a memo in response to questions that they said that the form-based requirements and the parking maximums would be challenging for the construction of new automobile sales and rental facilities.  But the uses could be viable if granted a special exception use in an existing building or site. And we know that we have plenty of these sprawling sites. So if we don't want them, and I think that the transit corridor is a deliberate policy, move not to, then why are we allowing a special use exception? I also looked at other transit-oriented development policies in other cities and  It's pretty standard to exclude these uses.

Well, I did some reading into a number of studies that have been done in the cities that have had these for a while, cities like Austin and Portland and Minneapolis and others.  A 2021 study of Austin, which has had its energy score ordinance for 10 years, found that new home buyers are a motivated audience for these scores, and they typically spend an additional $4,000 on home improvement projects in the first year of ownership, compared to the annual spending of existing homeowners on energy, that is.  In Portland, Energy Trust recently conducted an analysis on homes which had received a score between 2017 and 2019 through its, you know, home sales disclosure program. And of these homes, over 2,000 applied for incentives for energy efficiency measures, and these upgrades resulted in almost 1 million kilowatt hours of electricity savings.  and over 60,000 therms in natural gas savings. The city of Ann Arbor, so our homeowners may well use these reports. The city of Ann Arbor will certainly use these reports just as the aforementioned cities have used them to identify the kinds of repairs they should be recommending that all residents undertake. Such recommendations are important for cities like ours where the housing stock is older.  The city will also use these reports, as these other cities do, to address and remedy energy inequities. The data we will gather through the home energy scores will help us determine which households have greater need and can benefit the most from city-sponsored grants to make energy improvements. Some of you may have also heard a suggestion that we link the home energy score to building permits pulled at the time of a renovation.  I see this as a both and because we are talking about different populations, people buying versus people renovating. I also agree that we do need to find a way to bring existing homeowners into this program. And I'm not a lawyer, but I worry that it may not be legal to do so via the building permits, given that the state of Michigan does not give cities autonomy over the building code.  possibly we could offer free home energy scores for people doing certain smaller scale renovations. As for those doing larger scale renovations, we expect and hope the state legislature will pass energy efficient updates to the building code, which will mean that larger scale renovations will make buildings significantly more energy efficient.

So, you know, as I previously shared, I am in full support of the intended goals I've heard. You know, I agree that we need to do everything that we possibly can in our fight against climate change. My concern with this ordinance has always been its potential to increase racial and economic disparities in the home buying market.  among those who are more likely to have low energy efficiency scores and who are less likely to have the money to make upgrades. These individuals are likely to be our neighbors who are low income, on a fixed income, people of color, people with disabilities, and those with other marginalized identities.  My concerns are supported by the A20 plan itself. On page 52 of our A20 plan, under equity impact, I've heard, I quote, lower income homeowners may suffer lower sales prices for their homes if they have inefficient homes. Rents may rise for highly efficient rental units, which may further exacerbate race and economic and income disparities in the community.  So I believe tracking data is essential in the implementation of HERD, as is prioritizing those with the highest need for funding assistance to make energy upgrades. I will be voting yes on this tonight, but I also will be working with OSI and my council colleagues to create a resolution  that I hope will address proactive targeting of residents who are low income now, before a herd goes into place, encouraging them to undergo a free assessment, and providing them with the financial assistance that is available to them. Prioritizing these type of homeowners in general once the program launches,  And that a plan be developed for comprehensive monitoring, evaluation, and tracking of low energy efficiency scores, where they are overrepresented, the demographics of these areas, and other criteria which will help us assess potential unintended consequences.

Having that information on things that are specifically related to the  to energy and to the savings that I could have if I made my home more energy efficient. As I looked at the list of things that could be updated in my existing inspection, I looked at the ways that over the next few years I could continue to implement some of those. I prioritized some of them as things that I knew would be coming. And knowing that there are things that could impact  how energy efficient my home is, how that may reduce my electric bill, how that may help to contribute to our goals of becoming carbon neutral would rank on my list of priorities.

There is no such thing as an application that is otherwise valid for a zoning change. Zoning changes are considered on a per-petition basis, and any decision we make tonight is not automatically precedent-setting for other parcels.  I am not a lawyer and neither is the caller who spoke to this point, but I do not believe that our vote opens the city to legal jeopardy, and I believe that I have been well advised on this point. We are not asking, we do not believe that a PUD would be appropriate for this project because PUDs should not be used.  when there is an appropriate zoning category. And in this case, there is one, C1AR. This project is across from the University of Michigan golf course, in the neighborhood of the stadium, and across from a business district. The developer offered four conditions. One, limiting the maximum height for the property to 100 feet. C1AR has no limit. The maximum number of vehicle parking spaces for residential use on the property will be one per dwelling unit.  The principal use of the property shall be multiple-family residential, and no more than 30% of the units may be short-term rentals. The property shall have no natural gas connection except for emergency backup power. All but the provision-limiting STRs were part of the site plan that the developers brought to the Planning Commission, so they were very happy to offer these conditions, and they were happy to offer the one about STRs as well. Now I am going to do some math, and this is a little dangerous, but  If the development maxes out the 30% ST STR's that will be 64 to 65 out of 218 units 218 minus 65 gives us total residential 153 I don't have total confidence in that number, but I think it's pretty close which is a net gain of roughly 115 units over what is currently on the site which is as I've said three times now 38 Councilmember I am done", "start": 8366.662, "end": 8558.91, "Transition": "\"\"", "Meeting Section": "Other", "Speaker Role": "Other", "is_public_comment": 0, "is_public_hearing": 0, "is_comment_start_trigger": 0, "is_comment_end_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_start_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_end_trigger": 0}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_28", "text": "Further discussion?

Thank you, Mayor. So this is in the fourth ward, and I wanted to thank everyone that spoke about this. Someone brought up us, you know, I guess I'll just speak for myself, running on affordable housing. And, you know, I ran on a platform of providing more housing of all types. People who work in affordable housing will be the first to tell you that we need more housing of all types to meet our affordability crisis.  And in fact, I recall several months ago when the topic of this development came up, I'm pretty sure that City Council got a letter of support from Avalon, who is the next door neighbor to this development. So all that is to say that I think this is in alignment with our desires to provide more housing. Councilmember Dish already went through the numbers, which I was prepared to speak. You know, this is a net gain in housing.  The needs that they plan to provide for in the shorter realm, and I think it's probably important to specify that short-term rental is defined as 30 days or less, but we do have a lot of people that come into our community that need a longer-term but shorter-than-a-year stay.  Personally, I housed a postdoc in my house at one point when I was a graduate student. We have visiting scholars. We have people that are making use of our hospital. We have people that are having extensive repairs done to their house that need a place to stay. Not to speak of all of the, you know, startup development people that I think that these developers are interested.  So I think, you know, this is a need that needs to be met. I think this development's exciting. You know, I'm a little dismayed at some of the comments about, I think that there's been a lot of fear mongering. And I think as a result, you're hearing people react to that about this being a slippery slope.  And I certainly understand that people don't want to be surrounded by transient residents in the neighborhood that they've put roots down in.

The difference is that many will be housed in hotels and a few rentals that could be found for families. Another difference is that American families are not welcoming them into their own homes during a pandemic.  So we know Southtown might not meet refugees immediate needs either unless say they employ refugees and other low-income residents. So what's the connection? The connection is that we cannot truly be a welcoming community without addressing housing supply, all types of housing. Our housing crisis has become a game of musical chairs. We do not have enough chairs. No one moves when the music plays.  Nonetheless, they are paid above market rate, and no one is giving up their chairs for below market rate or what they originally paid. And when the university snatches those chairs, we invite builders to build benches next to a stadium that nearly doubles our city's population with every football game, next to a stadium that has been in place in some form since 1927 or for the past 96 years.  Thankfully, that work will also bring additional taxes as investments to our affordable housing millage. Let me also add that I'm extremely grateful that this site will include child care. Federal pandemic child care funding expires on September 30th. By one projection, 70,000 child care centers will close around the country, but to know that a center will be opening here,  When schools still struggle to bring back pre-pandemic before and after care, that's community building in a state that is supposed to be growing our population.

It is awesome. The site plan proposes two multi-story towers on top of a single-story podium, creating a development with over 200,000 square feet, including ground floor commercial and resident amenity space.  So and as I mentioned before there will be one auto parking space for every four apartments which is a ratio we really like because it's not a high ratio, and one bicycle space for every apartment which is another ratio that is great.  One of the speakers at the public hearing raised a concern about setbacks. The building will have front setbacks along its four street sides, ranging from 5 to 10 feet at a minimum. The front setbacks are greater than that in many locations because of the variations in the building design.  The building will also meet Ann Arbor's downtown street design manual guidelines for destination streets. And if that sounds abstract to you, let me put it differently. We use this design to ensure a hospitable environment for pedestrians and cyclists and leave room for other things that make pedestrians cool and happy, such as street trees.  This building will provide at least 19 feet from the back of the curb and the building face. It also, as has been mentioned, has a public pedestrian plaza and green roofs. The site plan provides for sustainability in three major ways. It is an all-electric project, which, as we heard earlier, will be achieved by geothermal and solar.  It uses mass timber and cross-laminated timber sourced from sustainably managed forests. This is a building structure that continuously stores carbon and may remove approximately 1,700 metric tons of carbon from the air, which is equivalent to over 4 million miles driven by gas-powered cars.

So this comes to us from a resolution that was passed at the last Transportation Commission meeting in August. And this is one of the first things that I started to work on early in my term on council. I think it's work that began before.  I was on when Councilmember Briggs was the liaison on the Transportation Commission. So this is the work of a subcommittee that was tasked with looking at how we might improve the neighborhood traffic calming program. And it was kind of the perfect thing for me to get involved in because I ran, you know, on a commitment to prioritize safe roads for all.  So we have a long list of traffic calming projects and requests and I know that personally my inbox fills with a lot of complaints about speeding a neighborhood streets and other dangerous behaviors like not stopping at stop stop signs Using streets as cutthroughs to avoid traffic lights is a recent one that I heard about And so we know that the demand for this is high and  Also, community engagement around capital improvement projects indicates a high demand for slowing vehicle speeds and improving the comfort on our local streets. But where the problem exists is that the process as it exists now is pretty onerous, and it doesn't allow staff to incorporate well-established tools for traffic calming in road construction projects where calming is needed unless and until residents engage in a separate petition-led process.  So one example of this is the Greenview Project. Greenview is very close to my house. It's a street that runs between Sio Church and Stadium, so it's used as a cut-through. It's also extremely wide. It runs straight. It has no stops between one side and the other, and so speeding has long been a problem on that road.  So when they were engaging the neighborhood process of engagement, they came to the residents and said, we know that there's a speeding problem on here. We have these goals in our transportation plan to make the road safe. So we need to slow the traffic.  However, there's this whole set of tools that we cannot use, including speed humps, any vertical elements basically, raised crosswalks, speed tables, because that is exclusively the domain of the Neighborhood Traffic Calming Program, and that is a separate process led by petition. So this is an issue, you know, that doesn't make a lot of sense to residents that there's a whole set of tools that are basically effectively put off to the side and not available except through a separate process.  So the whole goal with this resolution is to simplify the approval of projects that are part of the petition process. So we're maintaining that process, but we're also empowering staff to include the full range of established calming elements that come from NACTO and other respected organizations. For any projects that significantly disturb the road service and paying particular attention to roads that are part of the All Ages All Abilities Network that are identified in the transportation plan,  Roads that are in a school walk zone roads where a record of crashes speeding or resident complaint exists or otherwise suggest a need for calming to enhance the comfort and safety of Folks in on the street regardless of petition status Sorry, I'll stop Further discussion Councilmember breaks", "start": 10326.878, "end": 10535.552, "Transition": "\"\"", "Meeting Section": "Other", "Speaker Role": "Other", "is_public_comment": 0, "is_public_hearing": 0, "is_comment_start_trigger": 0, "is_comment_end_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_start_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_end_trigger": 0}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "text": "Yeah, so I'm happy to answer any questions that may come up. This, as Council Member Ackman mentioned, has been a process that's been going on for quite some time. The Transportation Commission approved starting the subcommittee in August of 22, and the subcommittee started meeting in November.  and I think we anticipated that it might be a little bit of a quicker review than it turned out to be. I would really like to thank staff for engaging so thoughtfully with us on this and how many staff members actually participated in this process.  There was a lot of back and forth and a lot of making sure that we really understood kind of what the implications might be of making certain tweaks, making sure we're not overextending certain programs to  achieve other goals. So anyway, this is taking neighborhood traffic calming, putting it more as an administrative function as it should be. Traffic calming projects will still, of course, the contracts will still come to council for council approval, just like other contracts. But what we don't need to be doing is having staff have to come to us every time there's a tweak in the program that they want to make.  And we know that this is a highly popular program in our city of other things that I get calls on and request for more of it is traffic calming and I have to tell folks to wait in a long queue.

This resolution is aimed at making it easier for everyone to monitor Annapurna's progress towards adopted goals, compare ourselves to peer cities, and find relevant data and reports. Many city departments are clearly quite committed to sharing data, but it's often scattered across the website and hidden under project subpages or different city initiatives, and our approach to performance monitoring isn't consistent across the organization, and we're often missing critical information that helps us monitor progress towards adopted goals.  So since we're in the process of redoing our website right now, it's an ideal time to address this. We just received the equitable community engagement report. This resolution directs the administrator to do four things. One, review municipal best practices and performance management and open data. Evaluate the city's current approach to data access and performance management. Develop an exemplary centralized dashboard that provides residents with an easy access to key performance indicators, community indicators, and open data.  And then finally, develop an accessible and standardized approach to performance data reporting across all city departments to enhance the visibility, accessibility, and monitoring of policy goals and key performance metrics. Department websites should include standardized public dashboards as well as an access to open data, maps, and more detailed regularly published reports as relevant.

Elected in 1974 as a member of the Human Rights Party,  Kathy Kozichenko is a trailblazer in queer history, and more broadly, the history of our city and our nation. I have had the incredible privilege of connecting with Kathy several times now. And while she remains an incredibly humble person who has generally shied away from the spotlight since leaving council,  She acknowledged her historic accomplishment in her 1974 victory speech when she said, quote, this is the first time in the history of the US that someone has run openly as a gay person and been elected to public office. Gay liberation was not a major issue in the campaign. Both candidates in this ward said they supported gay rights. But 10 years ago, or even three years ago, lesbianism would have meant automatic defeat.  This year, we talked about rent control, we talked about the city's budget, we talked about police priorities, and we had a record of action to run on. Many people's attitudes about gayness are still far from healthy, but my campaign forced some people to at least re-examine their prejudices and their stereotypes.  Kathy's election helped pave the way for thousands of openly LGBTQ elected officials in the decades that followed her election, including my own and those of at least 1,185 LGBTQ plus out elected officials currently serving in the United States today. Until recently, with the help of increased visibility from national organizations like Victory Institute and the Human Rights Campaign, Kathy's story was not well known. And historically, we as a city have not done a very good job of telling it.  Next year is Ann Arbor's bicentennial, and because it conveniently coincides with the 50th anniversary of Kathy's election to this council, it is a perfect opportunity for us to rectify this. This resolution, to begin the process of erecting a statue of Kathy Kozyrchenko on City Hall grounds in partnership with Statues of Equality and seeking a complementary state historical marker, is, in my view, an exceptional and long overdue way for us to formally recognize Kathy's place in history,  and to celebrate the impact her election had on the broader LGBTQ civil rights movement.

She was the first openly gay candidate to be elected to office in the United States, elected by the people to represent the second ward on Ann Arbor City Council in 1974 as a member of the Human Rights Party. Her story is incredibly powerful and it is an instruction in courage.  Though her work remains unfinished, it is right that during our bicentennial, we honor her and we express our righteous civic pride in the fact that Ann Arbor is the home of her incredibly important accomplishment. In addition to that fact, the fact that we look to recognize an historic Ann Arborite, an historic individual, I'm delighted that we are poised to contribute to the increase of public statuary that honors women.  By some counts, less than 3% of public statues depict women. This condition denigrates the experience and contribution of women over the generations, and we as a culture need to remedy it. I look forward to working with Statues for Equality, a well-known organization of artists devoted to this purpose, to work with them to right this wrong here in Ann Arbor and to effect a glorious good, and that is to say to honor an accomplishment of a great Ann Arborite on our bicentennial.

So, you know, this is an appropriate resolution to bring right after Labor Day. For those of you who don't know, subminimum wage is basically an inhumane labor practice that was originally developed in the 1930s to give people with disabilities jobs to keep them out of institutions. It's the ability for employers to gain a waiver from the state through the Department of Labor called 14C waivers to legally pay employees with disabilities less than minimum wage.  It should be noted that it's not legal to pay underperforming employees under minimum wage. And it rests on the assumption that people with disabilities will perform inadequate work.  There is quite literally no limit to how little a 14C employer can pay an employee. As outlined in the resolution, more than 60% of 14C employees make less than $3 an hour, and 23% of those employees are paid less than $1 an hour. In Michigan, there are currently 16 employers with 14C certificates, and nearly 700 individuals being paid subminimum wage. Currently in Ann Arbor, there are no registered 14C certificate holders.  which is great, and this resolution is our statement that we strongly discourage employers from seeking these waivers in the future due to our city's commitment to fair labor practices and human rights. This practice also has real economic consequences for our state, considering people with disabilities have already experienced the highest rates of unemployment and poverty.  So this resolution is essentially seeking that our city administrator advocate to the state legislature to do what 22 other states in the nation, as well as dozens of others,  We're also beginning this process to phase out the use of 14C waivers by exploring and utilizing various programs called Competitive Integrative Employment Programs, also known as CIE.

The person who's probably best equipped to speak about it is our city clerk, Jackie Boudry. She has spent a great deal of time educating me, so I'll try to do her justice. With the adoption of reforms in the state of Michigan that allowed an expansion to ballot access to  absentee voting and to early voting. The logistical challenges of administering an election in a city like Ann Arbor and across the street have become extremely complex. The majority of our voters vote by absentee ballot now. Before the reforms of 2018, most, if not all certainly, but the vast majority of ballots were cast at a polling place on election day.  and the counting and sorting occurred in those individual precincts. Now, the majority of our ballots are cast as absentee ballots, which requires a, like I said, very complex logistical operation to keep voter registration forms, which can now be filled out up to and on election day.  absentee ballot request forms, absentee ballots themselves, voted absentee ballots, all of the workflows and physical processes to administer these forms have to be physically separated from each other to keep these flows from intermingling with each other and getting mixed up. And they have to be separated by ward and precinct as well. And so it creates,  There's a need for an immense amount of physical space to properly administer an election in the state of Michigan now. Before 2018, all of that administration happened right here, actually, the clerk's office behind you and in this council chamber.  And it was easily managed. Over the last several elections, we've had to commandeer space outside of City Hall. In 2020, when the public schools were closed, we used the Huron High School gym as an absentee ballot count board space, 4,500 square feet.  It was a wonderful place for us to hold an absentee ballot count board, but once the schools reopened, we don't have access to a space like that in City Hall. So we are constantly kind of bubble gumming space together to make sure that we have a secure facility to process these ballots.  We've also had to commandeer city facilities to create high security ballot storage, which is not something we've had to do in the past. Every election, we have to change where that location is, which means moving a lot of cameras and re-keying doors and things of that nature. It would be ideal if we could have that in one space. We also have high precision, very sensitive ballot counting equipment, which is meant to be stationary.  But with our current operation, it has to be moved into storage and out of storage to ballot counting locations every election. And so it's important for us to really solidify a space for our election administration. As our elections have changed, as, you know, threats to our elections have changed over the last eight years, it's become very important for us to  change how we interface with our election processes as well and kind of modernize how we do things and bring them up to a you know 2024 standard.", "start": 11749.735, "end": 11967.981, "Transition": "\"\"", "Meeting Section": "Other", "Speaker Role": "Other", "is_public_comment": 0, "is_public_hearing": 0, "is_comment_start_trigger": 0, "is_comment_end_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_start_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_end_trigger": 0}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_28", "text": "Councilor Song.", "start": 11967.981, "end": 11968.542, "Transition": "\"\"", "Meeting Section": "Other", "Speaker Role": "Other", "is_public_comment": 0, "is_public_hearing": 0, "is_comment_start_trigger": 0, "is_comment_end_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_start_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_end_trigger": 0}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_06", "text": "I was actually on the Executive Committee for Prop 3 back in 2018, so for folks who want to travel back in time a little bit, Prop 3 basically authorized automatic Election Day voter registration, no reason absentee voting, straight ticket voting.  and allow basically what our military and overseas voting folks experience when they vote here. And it was so timely given that the pandemic followed shortly after.  And just lowering those barriers to access to vote is supposed to ensure a stronger democracy.

So as we began identifying facilities for an election center, one of the physical attributes you need in a building is large open space. As I said, the absentee ballot count board we had in 2020 was a 4,500 square foot basketball court.  You know, in total, the space we need for the election center, I think we estimated it to be between 12,000 and 14,000 square feet, depending on the configuration. But it was difficult to find buildings of that size that also had large open spaces and didn't need a lot of structural work to open them up. And we realized that if we wanted a building with those open spaces, we need to think a little bigger.  and started thinking about other city operations that could potentially partner into this building, and CTN is a natural partner. You know, something the community may be aware of is a lot of people are cutting their cable cord, and our CTN, Community Television Network operation, is funded with PEG fees, which are fees that individual cable subscribers pay into our CTN fund.  As those revenues are declining, we need to find ways to operate CTN in a more economical way. Right now, we lease space. We believe that moving them into this building in a new studio that is purpose-built for maybe a different production future and different operational future for CTN also has the opportunity to save them operating expenses on their facility, potentially more than 50% savings in annual operating expenses.

No Mayor.  Thank you. We do have one introduction today that is a proclamation to celebrate September 2023 as Recovery Month. Mr. Stabenow, would you join me up? Well,  One of the things that sets Ann Arbor apart, one of the things that we appreciate and that give me such great pride with respect to Ann Arbor is our community values. Indeed, Ann Arbor truly is for everyone. And that is foundational to who we are. It's foundational to how we organize ourselves as a community. And one of the  constituent parts of our community is the members of the Ann Arbor community who are in recovery. And I am just so proud that Ann Arbor is a place that is recovery friendly, where the community members who are in recovery are welcomed and supported at each and every location within Ann Arbor.  They're ordinary folks living their day-to-day lives with extraordinary strength. And it is something that is incredibly, incredibly admirable. And I'm just so proud that the way that we work to integrate, we do integrate members of our recovery community in Ann Arbor. And so I'm delighted to read this proclamation in small part to express that. Proclamation celebrating September 2023 as Recovery Month.  Whereas September is National Recovery Month, and whereas addiction is a major national public health issue affecting those who suffer, their families, loved ones, and their communities. Whereas recovery is a reality for millions of resilient Americans whose life has been transformed, and as a result, so too have their families and their communities. Whereas recovery from addiction flourishes in supportive, recovery-friendly communities.  Whereas Ann Arbor is such a recovery-friendly community, home to a vibrant, diverse, and thriving recovery community, a model recovery-oriented system of care, recovery-friendly employers, collegiate recovery programs, and many recovery allies and dedicated professionals who help people initiate and maintain their recoveries.  And whereas proclaiming September 2023 as Recovery Month serves to applaud those who are in recovery, their families, loved ones, and the community that supports them, providing hope to those who still suffer and affirming our shared belief in redemption and second chances. Now, therefore, I, Christopher Taylor, Mayor of Ann Arbor, Michigan, do hereby proclaim the month of September 2023 as Recovery Month and invite residents of Ann Arbor to support those in recovery and the programs and services designed to help those in need.  Thank you. All right.", "start": 226.1, "end": 426.007, "Transition": "\"\"", "Meeting Section": "Other", "Speaker Role": "Other", "is_public_comment": 0, "is_public_hearing": 0, "is_comment_start_trigger": 0, "is_comment_end_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_start_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_end_trigger": 0}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_08", "text": "Hello, everyone. Thank you, Mayor and Council, for once again recognizing September as Recovery Month. My name is Matt Statman, and I've told my story here before, but I'm going to do it again. I grew up here in Ann Arbor. I developed a substance use disorder in Ann Arbor, and I broke the law in Ann Arbor. I went to jail in Ann Arbor. I went to prison as a result of things I did in Ann Arbor.  I also got publicly funded long-term treatment in Ann Arbor. I had access to entry-level jobs and affordable, supportive, structured housing that did not discriminate against me based on my legal history. And I've now been in abstinence-based recovery in Ann Arbor since 2002.  And in that time, I've attended Washtenaw Community College, Eastern Michigan University, and the University of Michigan. I now work at the University of Michigan managing the collegiate recovery program. I also teach in the School of Social Work at Eastern Michigan University, and I do work with the local courts to help people get adequate care for their substance use issues rather than punishment.  And my story is not unique. Ann Arbor is home to a diverse and strong recovery community. We are everywhere. It's likely that you interact with people in recovery all the time and you may not know it. Ann Arbor is a great place to be in recovery and we also have work to do. And I'm going to tell a story. The other day I was  doing an assessment of a guy who was court-involved and needed treatment, and we were talking about his history, and I asked him about his substance use, and he said, man, I'm from Ann Arbor. Like, I get high. And it was almost as if substance use was synonymous with growing up in Ann Arbor, and  Recovery should also be a place that is synonymous with growing up in Ann Arbor if you have a substance use issue. So we have work to do. Affordable housing, especially recovery safe affordable housing, is a barrier for people in early recovery living near their workplaces or finding homes in places with access to the social determinants of recovery.  Access to adequate treatment is still not equitable and certain populations have easier access to good care. The legal system still needs a lot of work and people with history of addiction still face discrimination in many workplaces. We've done a lot to address these issues. Ann Arbor has a Recovery is Good business initiative where local businesses hire people in recovery intentionally. And we have  work to do, as I said. So in order to make Ann Arbor, continue to make Ann Arbor an increasingly recovery-friendly community, we should continue to focus on these things and we need to celebrate the work we've done and the hundreds, if not thousands of people in recovery and their families in our community. So thanks again for recognizing this and I'm gonna turn it over to my friend John here.", "start": 431.442, "end": 623.249, "Transition": "\"\"", "Meeting Section": "Other", "Speaker Role": "Other", "is_public_comment": 0, "is_public_hearing": 0, "is_comment_start_trigger": 0, "is_comment_end_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_start_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_end_trigger": 0}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_22", "text": "Hi, my name is John. I'm a person in recovery. Going all the way back to just the story, there's too many stories to tell. I was young, full of angst. Around 10 or 11 years old, I began to recognize that I needed to change how I felt.  Fast forward to that, drugs and alcohol became something that I used in my life to change how I felt. And it worked for a little while until it doesn't work anymore. And then before you know it, I was overwhelmed in a culture of addiction, partying, and hanging out with the wrong environment.  Fast forward, there's a lot of consequences, a lot of missteps. And before you know it, you're 35, 40 years old, out of touch, and in denial.  I had to figure out, or what they would call radically, accept that I wasn't going to be able to change on my own. I needed help from other people. And so I went to programs that told me that I needed other people. I went to these programs, and I got a sponsor. And my sponsor said, go to meetings and shut up.  and just listen to what other people have to tell you. Find out what they did. So 15 years ago, I began  that journey, and today I can say that, you know, I have, I'm experiencing the best life I could imagine. I have a couple degrees. I met Matt at the Collegiate Recovery Program up at Michigan. I consider him a great friend. And I landed at Dawn Farms, which I'm currently the coordinator of outpatient services.  So along with my story, there's also a lot of people that have the same experience as I, that I work with on a daily basis. And I have a staff that works hard with people that are trying to make a decision to radically accept that they need help from others. This is very important.  It is very important for people to know that you can recover from substance abuse, opioid addiction. I learned a long time ago, was told a long time ago that I probably wouldn't have a chance to recover. People that use opiates or heroin, they don't recover. And that's not true. We just need the right guidance and the right help.  As soon as I got here in Ann Arbor for grad school, there was some anxiety around coming to a big university like this. And I told them what I needed.  They told me about the collegiate recovery program. I got into the master's program I met Matt and a lot of other people that have the same journey and here I am Ann Arbor is a great place to be a great place to recover and But we got a lot of work to do Thank you", "start": 629.584, "end": 874.522, "Transition": "\"\"", "Meeting Section": "Other", "Speaker Role": "Other", "is_public_comment": 0, "is_public_hearing": 0, "is_comment_start_trigger": 0, "is_comment_end_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_start_trigger": 0, "is_hearing_end_trigger": 0}, {"speaker": "SPEAKER_15", "text": "We now come to Public Comment Reserve Time.

Glad to be here. My name is Mary Thieples. I represent two creative companies, Treetown Murals and Brush Monkeys. We have been serving Washtenaw County and the southeastern Michigan for over 20 years, bringing public art and window art to different neighborhoods and cities. Today I'm here to talk about consent agenda number six for all of you. It's the murals that bridge project.  We are identifying two major gateways to our community, one being the Huron underpass over here and then North Main Street. North Main Street is actually where I got my start as a public artist. The painting there still exists. It's very much in need of repair. But we've used this foothold to bring this new project to the residents and visitors of Ann Arbor.  This project is not only going to restore the wing walls, but also the fascia beam. So this is the first time actually the metal overpass that goes over the roads will be identified for public art. And because of that, we need a right-of-way permit. We will be closing the lanes one at a time in order to access the fascia beam.  We have hired Northstar Painting to do the restoration of the overpass. And it wasn't until recently that MDOT told us that Treetown Murals, Watco, and Northstar are actually not eligible to file the road permit.  So we have had to lean on the city of Ann Arbor to represent this project for us. And thank you to those who have already cooperated immensely on city staff to get us even on this agenda today. This project was slated to start in July and here we are in September. So it goes without saying that we're kind of moving this as fast as possible, hopefully at least getting the restoration done and maybe the wing walls painted and hopefully the whole project before the end of 2023.  free.  Now this is a twofold project. So tying into the bicentennial of next year, we hope to do the restoration and new murals on the North Main. And again, creating welcoming messaging to people coming into our community is kind of the big overhaul here. So today with consent agenda number six, we're looking for approval from the city to kind of go through with this project that the city would file the row on our behalf.  And that we could just kind of get going with the MDOT approvals now. I also serve as a public art commissioner Here in Ann Arbor and we've never had to deal with this aesthetic enhancement criteria that MDOT is putting for us But it's also just a great kind of learning curve for future public art projects So this is probably not the first time you will see this on your agenda given that 2024 we want to do this again so we are looking to  have the city support us and moving forward with this project.

A quick note on CO2 and Bicentennial Park. This is absolutely fantastic.  But I'd love to see some city funding going to improving the park and its non-car connectivity too. Many people come to that park from the other side of I-94, meaning they either have to take the pedestrian bridge from Mary Beth Doyle Park and then walk along Ellsworth, or they have to use the Platt Road Bridge, which has five lanes of speeding traffic on it, narrow, unbuffeted, and unprotected bike lanes, and narrow sidewalks.  Even just a lane re-striping to remove the turning lane from the bridge itself and provide buffers for the bike lanes would improve it tremendously, and there is even more improvement that I'm sure our engineers could come up with at the same time. I'd also like to continue pointing out that as a city, we're still underperforming on our goals.  Our progress on an all-ages and abilities bike network has been poor. Fully a quarter of our total planned sidewalks in the city remain unbuilt, and at our current pace it will take us another century to build them. We continue to wait for years for traffic calming projects, with the petitions for both CA4 and CA5 having been submitted all the way back in 2020.  We continue to have empty lots where it's not even legal to build a duplex because of outdated zoning laws and setbacks. And we continue to allow new construction with even more space dedicated to cars than to human beings. We continue to subsidize parking with underpriced or free government-funded parking provided all over streets all across town.  All of this contributes to automobile emissions, which are one of the largest forms of greenhouse gas emissions, not just in the city where it's even larger than the portions set aside nationwide, but in fact in the country and the world. If we're going to be serious about climate, if we're going to be serious about safety, we really need to focus  on getting our transportation.

I'm almost certain that among the members of council and me, I'm the only one who actually knew Kathy and witnessed the political events that took place at that time. As far as I know, there are no statues of any person in public view anywhere in the city of Ann Arbor. This is not a good time to start and this is not the right person to start with.  Kathy is to be honored for being the first openly gay or lesbian candidate to be elected to public office in this country. Note, Kathy wasn't the first person to be out while in office. That distinction is believed to belong to two members of this council who preceded her, Jerry DeGreek and Nancy Wexler, who came out while on council. She also wasn't the first openly gay or lesbian candidate for public office. That distinction probably belongs to the legendary San Francisco gay activist Harvey Milk.  Milk was elected to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in 1977. He was assassinated by a conservative member of that body within a year of his election.  Milk had run also as an openly gay man in 1973, before Cathy ran, but lost. He had the disadvantage of having to run and win citywide, while Cathy had only to prevail in the predominantly student and decidedly gay-friendly Second Ward, which is already represented by Nancy Wexler.  The resolution describes Kathy as a beacon of courage, but she disagrees. She said, I don't think I was brave because I was in a college town and it was cool to be who I was.  Nancy Wexler agrees. She said, in Ann Arbor in 1974, we had pretty much gotten everything we wanted for gay people by then. There wasn't really a debate over gay rights in her ward. So what were Cathy's contributions to the city of Ann Arbor besides this historical footnote? The resolution doesn't cite anything else that Cathy did except that she was an activist student at the University of Michigan. That covers many tens of thousands of people.  There are many other Ann Arborites who actually made major and lasting contributions to the life and history of the city who would be more deserving of such an honor. But in its 200th year as a city, Ann Arbor doesn't really need to start erecting bronze monuments to people. And if it did, choosing Kathy Kosychenko to be the first one isn't sound governance.

I'd like to talk about conditional zoning. I've written you  And spoken, the conditional zoning is complicated and counterintuitive. And I really wish we would have addressed it more publicly when we spoke about Southtown, where there was a conditional zoning. Unfortunately, council members, not all of you, some of you, chose to make disparaging comments about your constituents rather than addressing the meat of the arguments and the issues that were raised by those speakers at that meeting about Southtown.  That was unseemly. Unseemly. Where have we heard that word recently? When we were talking about conditional zoning at Lowertown, Lisa Dish used that word. After making some comments that were completely incorrect about conditional zoning regarding the third phase of Lowertown, she criticized people who were  proposing things for that project that they were hoping the developer might deliver on as unseemly things to ask for. Things like, oh, affordable housing, or sustainability in the form of further electrification. Maybe retail instead of a second pool, only half mile from Fuller Pool. I don't think those things were unseemly. You may differ in your opinion about it. But certainly, you were incorrect, Lisa, in your statements about conditional zoning.  because it was not the case that this was somebody applying for a project with conditional zoning. It was a developer who had already had conditional zoning put upon their property, asking for it to be removed. Very different. Let's get back to Southtown. There were a lot of meaty issues that could have been discussed, and most of them were not discussed. For example, we could have debated, discussed at the council table,  the non-primary residence short-term rental issue. Not too long ago, the city passed an ordinance banning those in residential zoning. Recently, more recently than that, in crafting the TC1 zoning, they were banned in TC1 as well. So we have residential zoning being converted to non-residential zoning, and in this case, Southtown, giving them up to 60 units  Are we giving a monopoly to this particular developer, or are we opening the door for more? That would have been a good point for discussion, rather than spending your time disparaging your constituents. I hope we have a better discussion next time.

I want to talk about an outstanding issue and then some positive action that's happened over the last week. But first, this is the crosswalk that I have been talking about.  Why hasn't staff addressed the concerns? And in one case, and I outlined this in the memo, the crosswalk sign is more than six feet in front of the actual crosswalk. So trimming was done around the crosswalk sign and then there is a wall of vegetation before you get to the crosswalk. Defies logic.  And you may say, why am I addressing this to council? Council sets budgets and council passes policies. That's absolutely right. But council passes budgets and sets policies for new programs, new programs. That's what we do in Ann Arbor. We don't evaluate our programs, even though that's very important with Vision Zero. We don't have feedback loops. We just go on to the next project.  And it's extremely frustrating as someone who's been to Vision Zero training to see us cherry pick aspects of it. We are not reducing our pedestrian crashes. We are not meeting our safety goals as we heard earlier. Now for the good news. I went to many of the house party events this week.  And it exceeded all of my expectations. It was so wonderful talking to people who I didn't necessarily agree with, but.  They listened to me, I listened to them, and I learned so much. It was wonderful. And one of the things that came out of it is that construction costs for middle-income families exceeds the market rate of that property in Ann Arbor. And that means that private developers will not be building middle-income housing in Ann Arbor.  It's not financially feasible. But there are ways to build thousands of units, and that is with  Community Land Trust, working with the University of Michigan. The county right now is looking at a housing commission that would support not only low-income housing, but also middle-income housing. So I believe that we are going to have some plans that are very complicated, but are going to be made public in the next few weeks.  And so, again, I don't think it's the city's responsibility and we definitely don't want to be using the affordable housing millage for middle income housing, but there are other creative ways to do it.

The suggestion that  Being the first to do something isn't nearly enough that she had to accomplish more. And that somehow, despite his own accomplishments that are worthy of recognition, a man who failed before her but succeeded after her is somehow more deserving.  Kathy, as an openly gay elected official, I am lucky to stand on Kathy's shoulders. Regardless of the tenure that she had here, what she was able to accomplish, what she, she stepped forward to serve her community and ran openly and honestly as who she was and  was elected and the fact that our community was somehow too accepting of her as being a problem or something that we shouldn't recognize because she didn't face enough discrimination during her campaign or enough pushback. It's just shocking to me. I think it's an example of why we need to elevate her and other people like her. And I will also say, I think,  public art is meant to spark conversation.

My name is Scott Munsell. My office is at 301 North Main proud member of the mighty 5th Ward I'm the attorney representing Andy and Julie Reif who own the property We're here today to request a rezoning from our 1c to office Andy and his family have owned that property since the 70s. There's a  Two lots involved. There's a small house and some storage buildings. Over the years, the ability to rent that for residential has become less and less attractive. And a few years ago, Andy moved his small commercial cleaning business in to the house. He has two to three employees.  And however, in 2022, the zoning administrator dropped by and said, hey, this is zoned residential. You can't have an office in this small house. So we've been working since then to address this particular issue. A key thing to remember, Andy,  and intends to continue using the building for his office. He has no plans to change the site at all. If there were ever to be a change in the future, there would need to be a site plan where issues of lighting, noise, traffic, et cetera, et cetera, would be addressed through the appropriate planning process. But he has no plans to change anything now and just continue running his very, very small business. The rezoning to office makes sense.  Both for Andy's use and also because in the zoning area it would act as an appropriate buffer between The residential uses to the west and the north and the very very busy commercial activity on the other side of Ann Arbor Sleen Road  particularly the gas station, which is immediately across the street and which has become increasingly busy over the years. We held the citizens participation meeting, addressed questions, we went to the planning commission, it recommended approval eight to nothing. And I'll just say there are two particular reasons why this rezoning makes sense. First, the city council's entitled to rezone property when there's been a change in conditions.  Number one, and then also number two, this change is consistent with the master plan. As has been noted, the change in conditions on why it's no longer appropriate for single family fronting on Ann Arbor-Saline Road, as opposed to the houses to the north, which all gain access from the back. They don't gain access. If you think about Ann Arbor-Saline Road in that area, all the houses to the, what should that be, northeast, they all,  their backyards front Ann Arbor Saline. They do not gain access from Ann Arbor Saline. In any event, there's been a change, a dramatic increase in traffic along that road created by the huge retail activity on the south side of 94 there. Again, I noted across the street an increase in commercial activity. It's really just no longer appropriate for single family housing.  Secondly, this change would be consistent with the master plan. As I mentioned, office is a zoning designation intended to be a buffer between conflicting land uses. And in this particular case, it would make a great deal of sense to shield the multifamily to the west and the residential to the north in a way from the more active commercial to the east.  It also is consistent with the sustainability element of the master plan, which envisions a higher level of density. The particular or activity, I should say, it's right on a bus line. It would be very appropriate for if it were to ever be developed, it would make more sense of the scarce urban land that we have in the city. And so we request that you support the request for rezoning.  And we're happy to answer any questions later.

None of that is permitted by the residential zoning, and so we are asked to rezone in order to bring the petitioner into conformity.  Now I understand why there would be concerns because moving from a residential to an office zoning is unusual. It is an intensification of use, but Planning Commission judged that an intensification of use makes sense for this property, particularly in the context where there is in this area  a fair amount of commercial activity, a highway and a gas station. But I also want to emphasize that there is protection for current residents. Any future expansion of either of the two buildings or their parking lots would require a formal site plan submission and would have to be reviewed and approved by the Planning Commission and or City Council, depending on what the nature of the change was.  So all we are doing here is allowing what's already happening there.  And should there be an expansion, we would have, Planning Commission or us, depending on how big, would have a chance to evaluate whether it was appropriate for the context. So I supported this on Planning Commission. And I think it is safe to support now. But I understand that sometimes just the feeling of not being heard can make, can stir opposition.

You know, I think it should be cause for us to think about how we structure our land use around where people live as well. The reason why I'll be supporting this, as I dug into the details of it, again, I don't see this as changing the current use that's been going on for four years. I don't, you know, I don't see any reason to think that it's going to  increase traffic, parking, or even be noticeable to the neighbors.

For all the reasons that have been articulated, I, too, am going to be supporting the rezone, and I guess I would like to emphasize something which I think was touched upon somewhere, but to describe the nature of the approval process briefly. In the event that there were to be a change in use, which, as we heard from a representative, is not contemplated, but in the event that there would be a change in use, that, of course, would go to Planning Commission.  But it would only go to Planning Commission after it had passed staff review. Staff review would include ensuring that whatever hypothetical site plan would come in with respect to these parcels, that it would meet whatever traffic study requirements, that it would meet lighting requirements, if any, that it would meet stormwater requirements, all those utility ability criteria.  All those would be reviewed by staff and compliance obligated prior to it being brought forward. So I'm appreciating the concern about the absence of those things at this juncture. The reason for that is because there is no change contemplated or proposed at this time to the use. It's merely an alteration of the zoning to conform with a longstanding use. Further discussion?

So that is the primary reason for this change, so that we can actually make sure that we get affordable housing at this site. The other deed restriction that this will be developed as affordable housing will remain in place.
