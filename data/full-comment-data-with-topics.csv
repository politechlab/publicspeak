I'm an American with a disability and a renter in the University District in Seattle, and I'm calling in in support of Council Member Sawant's bill to extend the eviction moratorium by one year. I'm an underpaid essential worker. I've worked the entirety of the pandemic. My expenses went up with COVID and my pay went down. I've lost wages to quarantine almost every month. Meanwhile, my burden has increased and the workplace has become deadly.  Healthcare expenses also rose drastically in 2021 for me and many others to account for the minimum wage raise. And now I owe $4,000 to an abusive slumlord. I've already cut into meds and foods at time to make rent, which has impacted my health and further risk my stability. My household has been living on ramen and rice for the past year, and my dog has gone hungry at times. We are formerly homeless, so we know what is coming. I have a tent and camping gear ready.  I lived paycheck to paycheck before this pandemic, and this isn't getting better. It's getting worse. Without extending the moratorium or finding a way to erase this debt, we will be homeless again. I have nowhere to cut from except for food, medicine, and healthcare, and I am in very poor health. I know in my heart that my life and the lives of many others rest in your hands upon your policies. My name is Ariana Laureano, and if I die on the streets of Seattle in 2021,  It will be your political choice. You may have saved us from COVID only to kill us with poverty.

SEA_01_04_21,SEA,"Seattle, WA",2021-01-04,2021-01-01,Training,Public Comment,Commenter,392.0,503.0,"Hi. Good afternoon. Happy New Year. Howard Gale, District 7, commenting on police accountability.  Today, you're going to be voting on a law establishing and clarifying subpoena powers of the Office of Police Accountability and the Office of the Inspector General, contingent upon the police unions accepting this law during the current contract bargaining. This highlights two well-established failures of our so-called police accountability system. One, that justice and community safety can and has been routinely given away by the city when bargaining union contracts with police.  And second, that the city council's predilection for form over substance when it comes to police accountability. Unless the right questions are asked in a police use of force investigation, unless an officer's claims are subject to critical inquiry, then tools like subpoenas are completely meaningless. For example, in the OPA investigation into the 2019 SPD murder of Ryan Smith, officers made claims concerning their fears that Ryan Smith's girlfriend was seriously injured and facing imminent harm  despite the abundant evidence that 911 operators knew for a fact that not to be the case. Yet in the OPA investigation, no 911 personnel or SPD command staff were interviewed to determine how this happened or if the officers were lying. Subpoenas are irrelevant without truly independent investigations. Seattle needs true police accountability as other U.S. cities voted to have this last November  based on real community oversight with an elected body capable of investigating and disciplining police, and of course, having subpoena powers. But subpoenas in the hands of people that are not asking the right questions is not gonna give us accountability. Thanks.",Police Reform

Howard Gale, District 7, commenting on continuing police abuse and failed accountability.  This afternoon, you will consider the council's proposed 2021 work program. The section of the work program on police accountability for 2021 reads like it was written in 2017, before George Floyd, before a seven-year-old child was sprayed in the face with chemical irritant, before over 13 SBD officers stood around and watched a woman they illegally arrested have repeated seizures as they stood around and did nothing.  Before Aubriana Inda was hit directly in the chest with a blast ball and, as noted in multiple media reports, died three times. Before an SBD officer, gratuitously and with clear malice, threw a blast ball at Seattle Gay News reporter Renee Rackety, concussing her and damaging her hearing. Before the injuries, beatings, and false arrests suffered by hundreds since last June. Before the SBD murders of Charlena Lyles, Aosea Falotogo, Danny Rodriguez, Ryan Smith.  Sean Leifer, Terry Kaver, and just recently Derek Hayden two weeks ago. None of these people will obtain any measure of justice or accountability under our current police accountability system. Yet for 2021, the council proposes more of the same with no significant changes. Have we learned nothing in the last nine months? Is it all forgotten so easily? Shame on any council member that allows this retrograde and thoughtless part of the 2021 council work program to pass without objection. Why does Seattle not observe  not deserve the police accountability system that the people of Newark, New Jersey, Nashville, Tennessee, San Diego, Portland, Oregon, and Chicago have chosen, a system that even our own Washington state legislature is now considering, a system providing for full civilian control of investigating and sanctioning police abuse without police investigating police. Yet the City Council and Community Police Commission have determined that Seattle should be exempt from these best practices. Why does Seattle remain stuck in self-serving, dysfunctional police accountability  that routinely allows officers to get away with abuse and sometimes even murder.",Police Reform

Today, the pandemic has been hard on downtown, which, along with Seattle's other urban villages, have absorbed 80% of the city's growth.

I am commenting on the Council 2021 work program included in the introduction and referral calendar. I urge you to include some critical missing elements. Within the Community Economic Development Committee, there is a line item regarding economic recovery for small businesses and workers impacted by the COVID. Impacts to downtown businesses predate the pandemic with open drug use, sidewalk camping, shoplifting, and personal safety concerns driving visitors away from downtown.  Unless these are addressed, downtown's decline will continue long after the pandemic ends. The work plan for the Public Safety and Human Services Committee infers that reducing the size and removing funding from the police department is an objective in and of itself. None of the work items appear to recognize that we are experiencing increases in violent crime and that public safety must be the determiner of police budget and staffing levels.  I did know one promising item called Community Safety Initiative, which seems to address the needs of the public, yet it is limited only to District 1. I would hope that Council Member Herbal would expand her efforts to recognize that everyone in the city can benefit from a program leading to increased feelings of safety. The Human Services Work Program includes one public health item. It addresses the city's response to COVID, but fails to recognize the other ongoing public health challenges, including TB and hepatitis.  Our biggest public health challenges, untreated mental health and chronic drug abuse are completely missing from the work program. Addressing these issues should be at the highest priority for the council since they are the primary underlying causes of inhumane and unhealthy encampments on our streets and in our parks. I urge you to make comprehensive changes to the 2021 work plan to support safe and healthy communities as your top priority. Thank you.",Public Safety and Law Enforcement

I'm a renter in Mount Acre, and I'm calling to express my complete disappointment with the council's decision to delay the vote on right-to-council legislation. This legislation is strong enough as is.  I have no doubt that any revisions would only serve to weaken it and exclude many vulnerable people. The idea of introducing means testing or eligibility requirements, which is the same thing, is absolutely ridiculous. People who are facing eviction are already a means tested group. If you have money, you're not going to find yourself facing an eviction notice. The argument that people making $100,000 a year would abuse the system is absurd. Means testing would only hurt to serve black renters, women renters, parents, and children.  Moreover, I find it incredibly hypocritical that council members claim to be concerned about the cost of this legislation, but had no problem approving a $370 million police budget.

It's shameful that she's wanting more time to understand legislation without even doing basic due diligence to attend the committee you're assigned to. It's absurd to say that the council has been successful at defending tenants because of some sort of foot-dragging approach.

Yet here we are, one year into a pandemic where Seattle's children and workers are completely dependent on corporate-owned Wi-Fi, which is prone to outages, and even for-profit throttling. And we don't have any municipal broadband.

Now, I'm worried that if we have more debate on this, you know, is it going to strengthen the legislation if a loophole emerges where tenants with small landlords have fewer rights and are means tested? No. Sounds like that familiar story of big business hiding behind the smaller ones because we know big business and corporate landlords can pay for things but don't want to. They claim it will hurt the smaller landlords.  When the Cheesecake Factory announced last year they wouldn't pay rent on 211 restaurants, they got a $200 million investment. No delays or means testing there. Also, it's important to understand that guaranteeing a right to counsel doesn't force small landlords to evict their tenants. That's the decision.

I know some of the council members brought up concerns about costs.  protecting renters now actually could save the city millions of dollars. In Baltimore, they passed a right to council, and that saved them $35.6 million by investing now instead of later. And they save on transportation costs,  trying to house and displace folks, all these things. I've also heard concerns about putting a limit on who's eligible for legal representation, a.k.a. means testing. And we see this all the time, and we see that it only hurts the most in need.

Pass a resolution to the mayor and governor extending the eviction moratorium through at least the rest of this year and passing the right to counsel legislation without loopholes as well. Passing these two bills would be extremely helpful, beneficial for renters, especially African-American BIPOC renters. Having an eviction defense can be the difference between life and death.  Using means testing to determine if someone deserves right to counsel or not during a time of economic downturn at this magnitude is dehumanizing. We are not rushing these bills either. Other cities have already passed similar bills. Just because the state is considering these bills too does not mean that they will even pass. Even if they do pass a bill of the right to counsel, it would not go into effect until next year.  We need you people to be proactive and plan for the worst case scenario. Please.

So council members should listen to working people who need you to pass the strongest possible bill, not listen to corporate lobbyists who want the bill weakened. And lastly, I want to thank our movement for making this bill possible. We exposed the city council's intentions to weaken the legislation and scared them off.  from introducing worse loopholes.

It was fifth grade. I went on a school trip for five days. Once I came home, I hugged my parents so tight because I missed them. The longest I've been away from home is only two weeks. While my dad has been apart from his mom for 17 years, I can't imagine being away from my parents for that long.  The closest thing my dad has to being with her is a video call through the phone, and he misses her a lot. Every holiday, every birthday, every Mother's Day, he thinks of her. A pathway to citizenship would provide not only my dad, but so many immigrants who have families in their home countries that she has to reunite. Seattle City Council members, thank you for understanding that our communities cannot wait any longer. Now we need President Biden and the rest of Congress to step up. The time to act is right now.

I hate to say this, but the homeless crisis is directly correlated to the open border sanctuary policies of Seattle Council and the Liberal Democrats, who bring as many foreign-born people to take somebody else's home and job off the market, making the bank donors and middleman owners happy while never being required to build enough  or the same amount of homes that are taken off the market by non-citizens to offset the oppressive supply and demand squeeze of outdated, obsolete, rundown housing choices. Democrats seem to care more about intercepting the capital gains stolen from the workforce than redirecting the capital gains back into the wallets of the workforce, oppressed by non-working middlemen shareholders every three months.  while the supply and demand squeeze proliferates homelessness and desperate room share situations and oppressive living conditions.

Immigrant communities and communities of color made immigration reform possible because we rose up in the 2020 elections and built our movements for decades before that. We helped put Joe Biden and Kamala Harris in the White House.  We took control of the Senate, and we made impacts on local and municipal level elections as well. Yet we see our elected officials, particularly in the White House and in Congress, hesitate. We've been told that we must wait, that our government will do the right thing. Our communities continue to be excluded, demeaned, and still to this day continue to live in fear. We see our leaders rise to the challenge every time, and it is time for  elected officials like all of you here today to do the same.

I attended the Labor Day protest outside of Spog. SPD officers launched blast balls at me, maced me in the face and forced me to march quickly while I screamed in pain, unable to seek treatment for my injuries. The police weapons and forced fast march triggered an asthma attack, causing me to pass out on the side of the road.  Ken, people tried to flee the gas, but the police had positioned themselves in a few different places to cut off access to anywhere we could possibly go to escape. Police threw glass balls indiscriminately into the middle of the densely packed crowd. Two of them exploded near my feet, hitting my feet and leaving burn marks on my sneakers. Police pulled the part of the crowd where I was in into a parking lot across the street from Spock. I thought SPD might allow us to disperse, but they did not. Instead, they funneled protesters into a thin line, seemingly indiscriminately blasting Mesa, everyone who fell out of this line.  I had a brown and white umbrella open for protection from police weapons, and police blasted it with pepper spray so much that it turned orange. I walked screaming in pain because of the mace in my eyes, crying for help. A stranger held onto my backpack to push me forward so I wouldn't be in danger of falling behind.

There were about 400 of us out protesting at the beginning. For a while, SPD followed behind us in their police vehicles, their lights flashing.  At some point, SPD started aggressively pushing us back, as they always do. I was fairly close to the police, trying to move back, but with a huge crowd ahead of me. We yelled, move, move, at the protesters in front of us, trying to get them to make space so we could move. But at one point, the crowd was just so backed up that we couldn't move at all, which was really scary. SPD started throwing an inordinate number of flashbangs at us when we got to Broadway. They threw so many at us that a woman on the sidewalk, who was just walking by, started yelling at the police to stop it and stop terrorizing the neighborhood. Next thing I knew, she was on the ground, being dogpiled by a bunch of SPD officers.  A couple people built a barricade and lit it on fire. Other than this, the only time I saw a protester damage property that night was when someone spray-painted a vehicle and immediately got arrested. The vast, vast majority of the crowd was not doing anything destructive or dangerous. Some people went towards the East Precinct a block away. I heard an explosion of some kind happen at the East Precinct, and all of a sudden, protesters came running back down towards us, followed by bike cops.

To illustrate SPD's harmful actions, I'd like to read an excerpt from a legal testimony from a person identified as NG about their experience as a journalist covering a demonstration in downtown Seattle  on May 30th, 2020. Quote, on East Pine Street, I saw a truck playing music as protesters danced around it. It was an uplifting, joyful scene. I paused to observe and record a video when law enforcement threw a flashbang grenade into the crowd without warning. They deployed tear gas seconds later. The dancing protesters at first scattered but then coalesced back into a group. Law enforcement pushed them back and continued to deploy tear gas and flashbangs. I was shocked and frightened by the consistently unprovoked  aggressive use of force by law enforcement officers and multiple different groups of peaceful protesters. I saw no evidence that any of these severe crowd dispersal tactics were warranted, and there was never any warning before they were deployed. At this point, I decided to leave the area because I feared for my safety. There was tear gas everywhere, flashbang grenades exploding in the street, and I was anxious that the police would further escalate their tactics. I decided that reporting on the situation was no longer worth the pain of enduring tear gas and the risk of suffering violence at the hands of law enforcement.  Witnessing the aggressive and discriminant deployment of chemical agents and flashbang grenades by police at these protests has made me reconsider how I approach my assignments. There's a new element of trepidation, anxiety, and fear to my experience of being a journalist. I am determined to assert my rights and do my job, so I will continue reporting.

Temple should reject Bill 119981.  SPD's $5.4 million of excess overtime spending and their $11 million of ongoing salary savings should go to community-led participatory budgeting, not back into a department that uses its resources to harm community members. I'd like to read a testimony of SPD's violence on May 30th, 2020 from a person identified as AWQ.  AW2 is a videographer and graphic designer residing in Seattle. He's a 28-year-old black man who protested every day between May 30th and June 7th, 2020. On three separate occasions that week, he and his partner were personally exposed to police violence in the form of tear gas, pepper spray, and flashbangs while peacefully protesting. These incidences occurred in Westlake Park and at 11th and Pines.  AW2 says, quote, before this week of trying to protest, I only symbolically and systematically understood what George Floyd and Eric Garner must have experienced when they were screaming out, I can't breathe. When the tear gas engulfed me on multiple occasions this past week, the words I can't breathe became more than symbolic. I personally and physically experienced what it felt like to have police violence literally choke me to a point where I was uncertain if I would remain conscious. This experience has affected every part of my life.  I can't sleep because every night I'm not at the East Precinct. I incessantly check Twitter and Facebook streams with friends and allies to ensure they are still safe. And when I wake up in the morning, I can't work because my brain has been on overdrive worrying all night. Headaches are a constant. Appetite is an all-time low. The pain and trauma of historical violence and oppression met with day-to-day violence perpetuated by the Seattle Police Department has coalesced into what I might describe as one of the worst weeks of my life. I know that when I attend a protest where Seattle Police Department is present, I will never be safe.  But I also know that these protests are an important part of holding the city of Seattle and police department accountable. I do not continue to exercise my First Amendment right. Nothing will change. So I will continue to protest. I will continue to protect my community, knowing full well how this may adversely affect my health. I yield my time.",Police Reform

I.e., we need a 21st century, first-world quality housing, commercial, and school build-out. A job creation for real equity.  It's obvious city council is going through such hard times because God is trying to convince council to get out of politics and is completely distracted from the fact society has imploded because the same city council policies aided, abetted, crack, meth, heroin, sex crime, predators, and violators who are conducting an uncivil war on community with impunity.  City Council should focus on their own family and retire from campaign for reelection since Council doesn't know what normal is for families.  and stop using tragedy as sympathy votes, especially when people's lives are being destroyed every night around 1st and Cherry Street, where no cops are policing malt liquor sales taxes at the 24-hour 7-Eleven, paying cops overtime elsewhere as all these evil predators destroying the homeless lives and any innocent passing through nightly all around the Pioneer Square area.  It's unfortunate the policies and the sabotaging of police reform by the city council and the mayor and lead has justified council retiring.

It's sickening to listen to this, to understand that we're still here and we're still debating funding the police department, which has done all of these things.  We have had a year for the police department to demonstrate any signs of accountability, and we have seen nothing. We were told to wait for the accountability partners to do their work, and the accountability partners have done their work, and we've seen training referrals. We've seen a couple of written reprimands. We got an assistant police chief demoted, but there's really been no addressing the root cause of any of this stuff. There's been no reform. There's been no commitment to reform.  And we have the dubious honor of sending the largest delegation of police officers to the Capitol Six to the Capitol insurrection on January 6th. This is not a department that's trending in a good direction. I understand that you feel that the court monitor has told you you have to pass this, but none of you have to vote yes on this. And I don't know how you can even think about doing that. I don't know how you can think about giving them more money after hearing this stuff. It's frankly, it's completely heartbreaking and it's unacceptable. If the court monitor doesn't want to produce accountability,  and the court monitor wants you to approve more funding, then maybe he should raise it himself in Harvard, in Cambridge, Massachusetts, which is where he apparently lives. He doesn't live here.  Every single person I talked to today, I told them that I was going to this meeting and every single person said, I have to work. I'm glad that someone is showing up to say things for me because I agree with you 100%. We shouldn't be giving the police money. This is completely absurd. This is frankly heartbreaking.

It also took the highly unusual intervention of the governor and attorney general in order to provide for a truly independent investigation. But what about all those people killed by Seattle police whose killings didn't get the prerequisite press coverage and whose families couldn't navigate what is an unresponsive and victimizing accountability system? What about those who didn't have family in the area to advocate for their loved ones and to bring their cases to light?  The families and friends of Charlena Lyles, Iosea Falotogo, Danny Rodriguez, Ryan Smith, Sean Leifer, Terry Kaver, and Derek Hayden had to suffer not just their loved one's murder, but additionally suffer from the fact that they were killed in Seattle where truly independent investigations have been and remain impossible.

I was not dangerous. I was not breaking anything or hurting anybody. I am a nurse. EB wrote that SPD used a constant barrage of flashbang grenades and pepper sprays to forcibly corral the crowd further and further out of Capitol Hill. At one point, I witnessed a woman shot at close range in the chest with some kind of gas canister. The force of the impact was incredible. I examined her later, and I suspect the hit broke her wrist. In her conclusion, EB wrote,  I had witnessed non-violent protesters being continuously assaulted with batons, pepper spray, and flash grenades for no other reason than their inability to immediately comply with law enforcement's demands while under assault. I had seen multiple people struck at close range with projectiles that could have easily shattered their bones.

I linked arms with the protesters next to me. One of the people next to me was hit in the back with a projectile. This person posed no threat.

Corporate landlords in Seattle are taking advantage of the improving economic condition to raise rents at double the national rate. At the same time, we're quickly approaching a new evictions crisis when the eviction moratorium expires. Imagine being a child right now who has just had their education and their life disrupted for a year and a half, starting to emerge from that situation and then being evicted from your home before the start of the next school year or during the next school year.

We face mental health and drug overdose crises that heavily impact Seattle. Last year, US overdose deaths reached a record high of over 83,000. Punitive drug policies have made things worse for decades, and cities around the country know this, and they're decriminalizing entheogens. Seven cities have done so, and if you decriminalize, you'll be in good company with cities like Cambridge, Massachusetts, Oakland, California, and Ann Arbor, Michigan.  Clinical trials suggest antigens like psilocybin are not addictive. They reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression and can help people overcome addiction. In the Netherlands, people can buy antigens over the counter. The Dutch government commissioned a study on their risks and concluded that the risk to public health was negligible.

OPA Director Meyerberg said last week that disciplining the four officers that did not enter restricted areas during the January 6th insurrection would, quote, serve to speed up the current decline of reason, objectivity, and fundamental fairness that plagues America. This is contrary to reason and fact. Many African-American SPD officers and hundreds of Seattleites have expressed fear and discomfort regarding SPD officers who attended the January 6th insurrection having power over their safety and lives.  This is so because of the undeniably high overlap between attending an event like that and harboring racial animosity or, at the very least, a high degree of racial insensitivity. SBD Policy Manual 5.01 actually provides forced sanctions against officers who engage in behavior, even off-duty, that undermines public trust in the department. Hence, Meyerberg did have a basis for finding that all six officers violated policy.  His office failed to investigate these complaints over the last four years, not just regarding January 6th, but other disparate treatment that SPD officers have meted out to right-wing versus progressive demonstrators.",Police Reform

I've heard that it's been unfairly singling out Israel, but when you read the bill, it's very clear. This ban applies to any nation state that is a human rights violator. The reason that Israel in particular is important at this exact moment is because we know there are records of SPD training with the Israeli police  And Israel has repeated violations of the Geneva Conventions. Condemning Israel for violating human rights is in no way endorsing anti-Semitism. My partner, who is Jewish, who can't be on the call today, is also in support of this bill.  Even if you deny the connection between violence of police in one state being used in another state when they train together, why should we allow our police to train with human rights violators in any circumstance?

Out of the 108 so far completed OPA investigations representing thousands of complaints, only three officers representing less than 1% of specific complaints have received anything other than a reprimand, with only two officers receiving just two-day suspension. In the decade before the SPD killed John T. Williams, 26 people were killed by the SPD.  During the decade since then, that number stands at 30. How is this progress? How is this accountability?

There is a direct connection between our current housing and homelessness crisis and the racist displacement policies that the City of Seattle enacted in the 60s and 70s.  Black families and homeowners were uprooted from their central district community, displaced, and redlined out of stability and prosperity under the guise of urban renewal, all at the hands of the city of Seattle. Homelessness disproportionately impacts communities of color precisely because of intentional racist policies like these, which are commonplace all across the country. The impacts of these policies continue to reverberate and have robbed generations of our Black neighbors of stability, prosperity, and community.

I represent Woodland Park Presbyterian Church, and we would like to speak out in support of Councilmember Sawant's resolution and the supplemental budget amendment to fully fund the affordable housing project proposed by New Hope Missionary Baptist Church. The price of rent in Seattle has risen 20% in the first half of this year already, a year when many residents are still out of work due to COVID-19.  We need to increase the Amazon tax to pay for more affordable housing in Seattle, and we need to make sure that it benefits the black and brown working-class families who have been pushed out of the Central District for decades by profiteering, gentrifying corporate developers.

Around one-third of SPD officers remain unvaccinated. According to the Officer Down Memorial page, in 2020, 65% of police line of duty deaths were from COVID. That is over five times as many as were killed by gunfire, knife, and assault combined. So police can kill a person because of an imaginary fear, but they refuse to protect themselves or the public from a very real and a very deadly fear.  This makes clear that police culture is so imbued with irrational fears and bias that policy and training will have little effect on it. There is only accountability, something the council has abandoned. For the first time in decades, council members will have to face the consequences of the bullying, antisocial, and transience that imbues police culture. That bullying, antisocial, and transience killed Charlena Lyles, Terry Kaver, Derek Hayden, and many of the dozens killed by the SPD since the start of federal oversight nearly a decade ago.  That bullying, antisocial, and transients severely injured and curtailed the rights of hundreds of protesters last year. That bullying, antisocial, and transients allowed SBB officers to escape accountability, guaranteeing a repeat. These are consequences of failed accountability. Now council members, having escaped all these consequences as they relax comfortably in their homes or offices, must face this bullying, antisocial, and transients head on,  The Seattle officers dare you to fire them as they maintain an anti-vaccination stance as a clear expression of underlying extreme right-wing beliefs and bias. But SBD officers warned you of this in February 2020 when they, many of whom were younger officers, voted in a landslide election for the right-wing nationalist provocateur Mike Solon to head their union, the only union of city workers refusing to come to terms with a vaccine mandate.

I'm a rank and file member of the Seattle Education Association, and I'm calling in solidarity with my union brothers and sisters in the Northwest Carpenters Union and other construction trade unions. We're demanding that the council pass council member legislation to require contractor bosses to pay parking for all construction trades workers. And it's shameful that contractor bosses who have made such massive profits during the pandemic force their workers to pay thousands each year on their parking. It's a regressive tax just to work, and it falls hardest on renters, single parents, and workers of color.  The Council's refusal to hear the motion for this legislation today just shows how big business interests set the agenda and how Council Democrats and business unionists alike are happy to shut the door on workers' faces. You can't claim to stand with workers, then claim there's no time to hear the legislation that would end this tax on working. I also want to give you a shout out to the Frankenthal Union members organizing to make our voices heard, and I want to raise the people's budget.

So Ibalzi really appreciates this partnership and again, would love to continue this and continue to make sure that funds get to the most needy Oakland residents. Thank you.",Homelessness

I need to know, Taylor, why you gave that letter by the five Black participants of the task force  to the newspaper. I think you gave that letter to the newspaper to cause problems. You had no business doing that, Taylor. And you need to explain why you gave that. And I know you did. You gave that letter written by those Five Minutes members to the newspaper. Number seven and number eight, local business contracting  and business empowerment. I heard somebody said, oh, this is gonna help Black small businesses. This is not gonna help Black small businesses. It doesn't even deal with Black. It doesn't even say it's gonna help Black small business. You got all of this language in there that's applying something, but doesn't directly deal with helping Black small business. You can directly deal with Chinese people and what they need, but you can't deal directly with what Black people need.  the emergency rental assistance program. Under race and equity, there's a statement that Black and Latinos are disproportionately impacted by homelessness. No, they're not. 70% of the homeless are Black, 13% in Oakland, 13% are Latino, 11% are white. Why are you always trying to make it seem like Black and Latinos are having the same experience? They are not in this city.  The other thing is 3050 International Boulevard. There is no room for parking for those units. Right now, they're using the developer's property just for the health clinic to have parking. Where are they going to put the parking for that initiative? And I'll speak at open forum about this Chinatown thing that y'all got going on, and you can't do nothing for Black people.",Governance and Civic Engagement

Stop spending our money. You know, we've seen the disparity. We need to quickly pass this resolution today, led by Councilman Taylor, and move into race-based set-asides and programs that will change the reality from the previous speakers. No reason Ms. Williams has not gotten a contract with the city of Oakland.

It is the first step, Council Member Taylor, and it's a monumental step. And I encourage all of your colleagues to support you in this effort, knowing that  There has much more work to be done. The disparity study has unveiled the inequality in contracting in the city of Oakland. One of the major issues with contracting is  Each department in the city does their own outreach. That has to change. Another thing that has to change is public works has to give more commitment to working with diversity by working with the Office of Contract Compliance, the old Office of Contract Compliance, and giving them a heads up on what projects are coming down the pike so that they can get the word out with the outreach.

My name is Carol Wyatt and I happen to be the director of talent diversity and professional services for Carol H. Williams. Carol has been in business as a black female 100% home business in the city of Oakland  for almost 35 years, and she has never had an Oakland City contract. Let me repeat that. The woman who is a member of a mostly white male advertising hall of fame, who just completed the United States Census national contract, who does work for the Fortune 500,  who has worked with the Department of Defense and who is presently working on COVID-19 campaigns for Kaiser has never had an Oakland contract. That is disturbing. I've worked for Ms. Williams for 20 years. She has hired more local Oaklanders probably other than the city itself, the county, PG&E and Kaiser.  She's trained them from creative to executives. Many of them are now working at Netflix, Pixar, and other companies. For her never to have an Oakland contract is absurd. She's worked on the port of Oakland's Oakland airport. She did the Unity Council's 50th anniversary rebranding.  But those are relationships that she had based with the people who were key in those organizations. We do business with the city of New York because they have a 30% mandate to women and minorities.

The model is deeply community-based and over 50% of those served by BACs have had previous experiences of homelessness.

After being in this business for over 20 years and done very well, he's looking for leadership. And today, what you have is the leadership that started with  Mr. Lauren Taylor because of his commitment. That young man right there has no representation because he doesn't have national representation. The NAMAC instance, for instance, normally you would have an organization like NAMAC status on this phone, but we don't have that. So  The local politicians that have got behind this agenda are really going to help us move this agenda and more jobs. We talk about jobs, opportunities. We talk about racism. We talk about systemic. It all comes down to one thing, economic improvement. If we don't improve the economic status in this community through this construction trades, you will not go because we do not have the technology people. We do not have manufacturing. This construction is the only way at this point to bring in pre-apprentices, formerly incarcerated,  people that have been totally disrespected in the industry of construction because of lack of policies that are talking about inclusion. So I'm sitting here today as a person that's overcome most of those issues because of the political strength I have with your council, because I've always been able to get five votes to understand the people's business.

With everything that has happened in the past year, COVID, with our economy, we're facing multiple crises, housing being at the core of our city's focus. I don't need to tell you guys, but just in case you need to hear, the people of Oakland are struggling.  They're struggling with jobs. They're struggling to keep your roof over their head and with the health pandemic. Now with Oakland policymakers that believe housing is a human right, we believe we can and should do more. The Keep Oakland House program does just that. It has served thousands of households and has prevented so many families and individuals from being homeless.  It uses an equity lens and supports low-income individuals and households. The program is community-based and has become a vital part of our community. Housing is a human right and I hope that you will be a part of the solution  And I strongly encourage you to continue supporting the Keep Oakland House program and allow BACs and our community partners to continue doing the work that this community deserves.

You know, these Zoom meetings are a wonderful democratizing force. Many more people that would not be able to attend in person are able to attend through this mechanism. And I'm just hoping that there is some way to meld them once we are out of this pandemic. I wanted to talk about a couple of items that are coming up.  Key point five, local tax software solution, the no-bid extension for HDL. I understand that HDL developed this software and it makes sense that they would be the folks to continue to maintain it. But when I looked at the stack report, it said there's no opportunity for social, race, and equity impact. I flipped over and looked at the pictures of people in that firm and  I think there may be some opportunities for race and social impact. And so, you know, as we look at the disparity in contracting study, I think we have to keep in mind the no big contracts that continue to roll out and what those providers look like and consider, you know, even if it is the right thing or fair or sole provider, what they do look like and what impact that may or may not have aligning with the city's goals toward greater racial justice and contracting.  That dovetails into the contract. You have a chance to participate in the forum on Saturday. I'm happy to see Councilman Taylor take up this piece of legislation and move that forward. I think it is a step in the right direction, but a step. I think it misses some things. I think it could be much, much stronger. But maybe most importantly, and this is more of maybe a question, it does not consider non-technical specific and licensed services  i.e. the services that may be most easily provided by local black and brown and underrepresented contractors. What is the dollar of volume that was excluded? And finally, black and brown people out here dying. Our voices should be overweighted in the public safety discussion.

I do think it's a little bit troubling some of the ideology and conversations that have come from some of the and also people who have been really engaged in the task force work as it pertains to pro police versus reimagining safety and I think that there is some grounding that need to happen in those spaces and I'm really hoping that  There's community members, primarily Black and Brown, most impacted East and West Oakland community members who are really radical and ready to reimagine safety in the form of reinvestment in the community.

And then in relation to some of the most recent Chinatown crimes, I did want to read  Some short sentiments from our executive director, Jackie, which goes, the Oakland mayor and city police department are counting on this moment in particular as a wedge issue to undermine the defund movement and make a case for more policing. This is an opportunity to challenge some of this reactionary rhetoric by demonstrating an alternative narrative and solutions.  Movement leaders in the Asian community and much more are developing long-term strategies that are centered in healing and transformation. They are leading with love and clarity.

Good afternoon, City Council, and thanks for the opportunity.  to come before you today to urge my support of the Emergency Rental Assistance Fund, item number 12. I'm Dr. Noha Abalata, the CEO of Roots Community Health Center. And Roots was invited by BACS just this past October to join in Keep Oakland Housed because they recognized our deep relationships within the community we serve in Oakland and in deep East Oakland in particular. In just the two and a half months,  Up until the end of the year, our incredible team, and you heard from Karina earlier, was able to get $420,000 into primarily African-American East Oakland households in greatest need to take care of their back rent at a time where we know that those bills are really stacking up on folks. And we know that eventually eviction moratoria will end. And we're concerned that the rampant gentrification and displacement we were seeing, particularly before the pandemic, will resume if we're not intervening  And we feel like Keep Oakland House really is that intervention. It's targeted. It's focused on those households most at risk. And it's really one of the greatest tools that we have in our arsenal to stabilize households by taking care of that chunk of back rent that we know that once it stacks up like that for most of our folks, they'll never be able to get out from under that. And it will be an excuse to be immediately evicted as soon as the opportunity presents itself. And so I know that today you'll be taking up declaring homelessness as a crisis. And we absolutely agree.  And we feel like this is a great intervention to prevent that from worsening. We were able to get those funds out the door with really lean staffing structure in a short period of time. And we feel like we were just getting warmed up.

I just wanted to quickly speak in support of agenda item number 12 for the emergency rental support and also in favor of or just in appreciation of item number six. Just wanted to thank the Council for putting forth the task force and the efforts to  Reallocate resources from enforcement and punishment, which has normally happened in cities across the United States and agreeing to find ways to shift resources over to prevention and wellness. We're excited for the opportunity and  We think that this will actually help create real safety in Oakland. An example of that could be the attacks in Chinatown. It came out that the young man who was responsible for the attacks was dealing with severe mental illness and homelessness for the Alameda County DA, which would not be solved by increasing enforcement or fanning the flames of anti-blackness as was done by the mayor.  the Chief of Police and the Alameda County DA. We know that more money and more resources allocated towards wellness services, prevention efforts, jobs, and housing are really what's going to help support people in an effort to move this forward as well, to get voices from the flatlands of East Oakland and West Oakland.  Urban Peace Movement, of which I'm the deputy director, we launched a survey last month and we got responses from over 240 black men from East and West Oakland for them to be able to use their voice to say what they believe, what they know will create safety for black men in Oakland.  And it's important to have their voices at the forefront because historically they're the most impacted by gun violence in our city. Every year they represent somewhere upwards of 60% of homicide victims. And so we feel like that they should have a seat at the table in determining how the resources are shifted over to prevention services and wellness.",Police Reform

I'm asking Taylor again, why did you give that letter by the five members of the task force to the newspaper? You should have the courage to speak up on why you did it. You had an item that dealt with construction of the International Indian Health Center, 250 jobs. You dropped the ball when we were trying to determine  why African-Americans were not getting construction jobs. The union refused to give you the information. You dropped the ball today on insisting on that. That's why I can't believe that you're going to do anything for Black people related to contracts because you dropped the ball and you have done nothing when union construction members refused to give you the data on Blacks getting jobs related to construction.  Why don't you have the ability to speak up for Black people? Why don't you do it? The report on rental assistance, did you hear what they said?

There are times when this council can support the community by simply using your platform to bring awareness and focus attention on issues and problems.

In his post, he wrote, quote, safety is our paramount responsibility.  We can all agree, without safety, how can a city operate or thrive? Councilman Gaya posts on his social media 54 times since Tatiana Duggar disappeared. He posted two times about Lunar New Year. He posted four times welcoming the new police chief.

I've been in Oakland for about 27 years.  First of all, I'd like to commend our council member, Taylor, for his efforts to actually increase our participation by local businesses. But there are potential pitfalls that I just want to point out. Earlier, there was a contract for HTL software. And by the way, at Company Echo Consulting, we were part of...  We work with Oracle to install the financial application for City of Oakland. We work with PeopleSoft to install the ACO link, the PeopleSoft ACO link for the county. So we're experiencing this kind of work. And I want you to be able to differentiate between sole source project and participation. The HDL contract, the way I read it, is actually sole source to HDL, which is not a problem. But the problem is  the local participation should have been mandated so that they involve local firms to perform tasks like perhaps maybe installation of the software or some training and maintenance. So there are many tasks that local companies can participate in. But the major one that I want to talk about is the city attorney's office. The city attorney's office  is actually one of the impediments to having local farms, especially minority farms, because we have a lawsuit now against the city of Oakland because they colluded with the bonding company for what we did on the Oakland LED project.

They make sure they get their medicine. You know, they rely on each other so much. And this is just,  the type of example that I feel that the community of advocates, I know myself, and I see the United Front Against Displacement out there as well, really trying to help because they don't want to live in this mess.  They don't want to be an eyesore. They're actually really good neighbors. They'd be good neighbors to anybody, but they need the support of our local government.

It was a pleasure to have you in attendance. Tonight, we've spoken about racial justice, about closing disparities for Black folks,  here in the city of Oakland. It's been the center of so much black activism and militancy over so many decades. And I wanted to lift up to the council the efforts of the Friends of the Hoover Durant Public Library to bring back the library to our neighborhood. You know, we had a neighbor, we had a library in this neighborhood, reading room in our library in this neighborhood from 1889 to 1981. At one point, there were two libraries in this neighborhood, one along  Grove Street, which some of y'all better know as Martin Luther King these days, which was taken out by their 24 freeway. You know, we are at the intersection of 580 and 24, and those two freeways are defined in many ways. The second library closed in 1981 on San Paolo Avenue. In doing some research, we saw that the library system had identified our library's foreclosure as early as 1936.  due to the changing nature of the demographics of the folks in the neighborhood. It took a while to close, but it did close. We are the only remaining area in Oakland that lacks a library, according to the library system's own standards. Recently, we've been awarded $500,000 to conduct a feasibility study. $700,000 has been awarded for the main branch. And we would not like the library system to join those two RFPs together.  We want to clearly call out and make sure that small, black, and minority architects are able to bid on that project. And we urge you to support bringing back a library.",Education and Youth Services

I want to speak to two items, item nine, the study of fourplexes in single-family areas, and items S20 and S21, the micro program. On item nine, as a practicing architect for over 40 years, I'm well aware of the move in urban areas and cities  to increase their density in urban areas. It's really one of the only ways we have to assure that we can provide housing for our many residents. There are two important points I'd like to be considered with regard to this item. Number one, the...  To increase the density to allow fourplexes is really significantly increasing the value of those properties. And if we're going to increase the value, the city should get some benefit. I would propose that for each fourplex that is developed, at least 25%.  of the units provided must be provided for persons with incomes, area median incomes, AMIs of 50% or less. Would also urge that,  No new fourplexes would displace rent-controlled housing. We must provide and protect the existing rent-controlled housing.

Vlad worked in public works for most of the 26 years that I was in public works and also during the initial time that I was director. And he was definitely a go-to person who I relied on in many ways, from the mudslides he mentioned to all kinds of emergency situations that  One would not even think you would involve engineers, everything from the time that Barack Obama came to Oakland and brought advanced Secret Service here to tell us how we had to lay out routes.

So I wanted to just mention that.  My second comment has to do with the item on the budget and how to spend any new resources coming from the sale of the settlement from the Coliseum Warriors deal and the federal government. I would hope it would be a priority to bring back the part-time  Positions that have been laid off, the temporary part-time staff that work in park maintenance and custodial. I think custodial has not been impacted as much, but park maintenance has. And it has resulted in no maintenance at any city park on the weekends and the closure of the gardens at Lake Merritt on the weekends. And as a result, there has been a lot of litter and you can tell that there is no staff attending to these issues that need to be attended to.  So I would hope that would happen.

I'm Laura Takeshita, Executive Committee Vice President for Oakland IFPTE, and I have been serving Oakland for 25 years. This federal funding is our chance to work in partnership, community, workers, and council to determine how to best use this opportunity to improve the quality of life in Oakland.  We must not repeat the mistakes of the past. We can't go back to business as usual. We need to understand how we got here, good and bad, then improve on the good and throw out the bad.

We need to move forward smartly.  We need to build back better for all of us now and for everyone in the future. Implementing in-house programs like MACRO to prioritize responding to mental health crisis with trained mental health staff is part of building back better. It creates a partnership between service providers deeply rooted in our community and our city leadership. It creates jobs that help create stability and service continuity. It's one forward-thinking use of this precious fund.  To use this money in service to all, the council needs to have a full, transparent assessment and accounting of where we are before authorizing any allocations and expenditures.

I am a resident in District 2 and I would like to speak in favor of the MACRO program. An Oakland version of that non-police crisis response system, which was brought to us by the Coalition for Police Accountability, is a wonderful opportunity for Oakland to improve safety  by steering calls away from the police, not only for mental health crises, but also for problems of homelessness, substance abuse, and other crises that occur in our communities. Also, as you are aware, gun violence is among the most pressing and distressing issues facing our city, largely because of the distress and desperation created by COVID.  the number of gun-related homicides jumped from 75 in 2019 to 102 in 2020. In the first two months of this year, we saw over 100 shootings and 15 homicides. I'm calling to urge the city council to fully fund the proven model that we have in ceasefire. Ceasefire has been shown by objective and scientific analysis to be largely responsible for cutting deaths from gunfire by half,  between 2012 and 2019. Now is the time to put financial resources where they will do the most good. We must recommit to the partnership between the community and the police that is represented by Ceasefire. Now more than ever, Oakland needs to financially support and strengthen that program. Thank you.",Public Safety and Law Enforcement

I see families forgo other necessities or even become homeless due to medical debt.  Children and their families suffer. If the COVID pandemic has taught us anything, it is that our healthcare system was not prepared. It left the public not protected and nurses and all essential workers without PPE. It laid bare the many disparities in healthcare. The current system left all of us dangerously close to no care at all, with the result that many were infected and many have died needlessly.  It is more important than ever to guarantee comprehensive, high-quality care, free at the point of service for every person in the state and the county. Our patients can't wait.

I'm going to speak on three different things.  One, the 192 million stimulus money that our city will receive from the federal government.

You may go ahead and speak.  Thank you, Council President. Good afternoon. This is Liana Molina. I work with the East Bay Alliance for Sustainable Economy. We're a member of the Refund and Defund OPD coalitions, and I'm also a resident of Deep East Oakland in District 7. My neighborhood is directly impacted by violent crime, homicides, as well as sideshows and other quality of life issues. Even though this is the case, I'm personally in support of the efforts to reduce the police department's overinflated budget  and to redirect those resources towards programs and services that help address the root causes of poverty and crime and that help keep our community safe. Organizationally, eBay stands with their allies at APTP, Courage, as well as city workers and the unions that represent them and others here to voice our support for the call to implement the macro program in-house through the Oakland Fire Department in the next four to six months.  Macro would ensure that Oaklanders have a mental health service with trained professionals equipped to support people undergoing a mental health crisis, while not leading with a response by law enforcement, which we know often leads to disastrous and tragic outcomes. By committing macro as a city service that's run in-house in partnership with OFD, we're committing to reimagining not just who responds to mental health crisis, but how we respond. Macro must be rooted in a patient-centered, holistic approach toward providing  life saving services through this partnership. It must also be set up with direction from a community advisory board,  led by folks with experience providing mental health support to survivors of state violence. With this in mind, we urge the city to draw on the capacity and experience of existing programs like MH First and other community partners like Courage and Community Ready Corps here in Oakland to provide the best emergency mental health services for our community. As a racial, economic, and worker justice organization, eBay strongly supports the longer term goals of creating a pathway to full-time work through the creation of safe, well-paid union jobs  particularly for black and brown Oaklanders. We can achieve this by implementing this model in four to six months by bringing in temporary part-time staff on a track to be hired full-time.",Police Reform

I'm speaking on behalf of Friends of Lincoln Square Park, an active community group committed to help building a new rec center at Lincoln Park in Oakland, Chinatown. I'm in favor of item 2.9. Wanted to thank you for moving forward with the architectural services agreement to get this started.  As you know, it's just the beginning. The city still needs to identify enough funding to complete the project. But Friends of Lincoln Square Park is committed to support and assist in these efforts. So Lincoln's not just a neighborhood park. As you know, it's the only staffed park and rec center in all of downtown Oakland. It's used by students, employees, seniors, families, community groups from all over the city and beyond. And in better times, it's the busiest park in Oakland. But the current building is deteriorating. And more importantly, it's way too small.  So this is not a new project. It's been on the Capital Improvement Project and on the list going back to 2015 and probably before. The community has been told it's in the works for over 10 years. It's in the current CIP prioritization list. It's the highest scoring parks and rec project, one of the highest ranking projects for that list overall. So I'm really excited to get this moving. So I urge you to look for other ways to allocate more funds to this project.  and invest in existing capital projects like the Rec Center that will have benefits to come. So leveraging your funds for additional opportunities like the Prop 68 grant that the city is currently applying for, our grant application will be much more competitive if we can show project feasibility by pledging more funds as our local commitment. I think that's a smart way to be using  our money efficiently. So investing in our youth and seniors that have been through so much this past year and investing in our, makes so much sense.

It's actually fitting that the big topic today is macro because we've identified where police were not helping a problem in our city and we realized that we need to fire them, which I fully support, but that's not what I'm here to talk about today. I live on Fairfax and Foothill where we experience a ton of sideshows. So I have two asks for you.  I want to see some police budget accountability. I want to know how much OPD says they're already spending on sideshows. I want to know how much they claim that they spent last weekend. My thoughts are if I'm making $200,000 a year to sit in my car and watch sideshows, why would I get out of my car and do any more work that is asked of me? How much are they already claiming to spend on sideshows and how are they being held accountable for it? And if they're not doing their job well, fire them.  Why are we considering giving them more money when we don't even know what they're doing with the money that they do have? I would be more than happy to sit in my car and report on the duration and attendance of sideshows for $200,000 a year. Where do I sign up? Second, I would like our council member, Shang Tao, to come down from the hills to Fairfax and Foothill and find out what our neighbors actually want.  Councilmember Tal apparently knows Mr. Isler of Isler's Liquors since she posted about him during Black History Month, and his liquor store is on that exact corner of Fairfax and Foothill. Have you reached out to him to ask him what he needs when hundreds of people show up on his corner? We want some police budget accountability, and I want my councilmember to come down here to Fairfax and find out what the people who live on Fairfax and Foothill actually want before making decisions about our neighborhood without our input.

As a longtime participant in the Reimagining Public Safety Task Force and one of the co-chairs of its advisory board, I'm deeply familiar with MACRO and the delays in its implementation. I want to state unequivocally that I'm a strong advocate for MACRO and shifting away from OPD.  However, as a private resident of Oakland, I cannot support macro legislation S-21 in its current form. There are too many poison pills in this legislation. I urge all city council members to vote no on this legislation until it can be assured that qualified staff or organizations are in charge of macro.  Let me be clear, the legislation being voted on today is not a vote to ensure that Oakland Fire Department runs or staffs MACRO. The legislation explicitly states this. This legislation is a transparent attempt by the Anti-Police Terror Project to win city contracts related to the program's design, evaluation, training of MACRO staff, and to potentially win the entire $2 million contract.  APTP explicitly mentions this financial self-interest in an email they sent to supporters yesterday, encouraging people to comment in support of MACRO today. APTP subsidiary MH-First can benefit from this revised legislation after losing out on their first shot at MACRO contracts last month at the Public Safety Committee meeting on February 9th.  This behavior by APTP and their allies is even more concerning in light of the fact that last month, the same group sent out emails encouraging members of the public to attack APTP's top macro competitors in our February 9th Public Safety Committee. Our city's own Department of Violence Prevention rated APTP's 60% less capable of serving our community than their top competitors. And instead of allowing a qualified group to have macro up and running before June,  APTP has helped to delay and sabotage this process to their benefit. I urge the city council to vote no on this legislation so that MACRO goes to the most qualified organizations.

I'm a resident of District 4, and I have four years of community mental health and homelessness outreach under my belt here in Alameda County. I work for a large nonprofit on a team that's funded through the Mental Health Services Act.  And we attempt to reduce recidivism and discover our own client's definition of wellness in doing so. About once a month, I hear from a police officer that they don't want to arrest our clients, but they will because of the pressures that they are receiving from the community. I work in most of the cities in Alameda County, Bear, Berkeley. I've had individuals peel skin off their arms and throw sharps at me while experiencing hallucinations and panic.  And yet we still cannot incite crisis involvement. And yet I am mandated, as someone who works within social services, to call the police in situations like this. I have seen rookie cops finding excitement in their day, slamming my clients' bodies to the ground while they stand in a circle observing. And the emotional toll this takes on me, as well as the person who disclosed that they were assaulted last weekend, and calling the cops and how we have to do that is absolutely disgusting.

I wanted to share that this weekend I was assaulted while walking my dog by another dog owner. And I contemplated, do I call the police? And I knew that I wasn't going to. And I thought about what that meant when I didn't call and who I could have called. And I imagined what it would have been in a world where I could have called a program like MACRO to intercede in this moment.  and what that could have meant in terms of really finding the healing that I would have needed and the person who assaulted me would have needed in that moment. And so I'm calling on a city council to really vote to implement MACRO by housing these services inside the city using temporary and part-time workers to move this process along with addition to community advisory board and housing this within the fire department.  And I also want to dispel some myths about what this administration has been doing, spreading lies about how we're spending our money because it is due to their lack  of accountability around the budget and being able to continue to fund programs that we need in our services. The violence in our city is due to economic times and to their mismanagement. We don't need more policing.  We need more services that address those needs.

I'm a member of East Bay for Everyone and a resident of District 3. I have comments on three items today. I support the item to study the policy of allowing duplexes, triplexes, fourplexes throughout Oakland. I wanna thank Vice Mayor Kaplan for bringing this vital work forward. There are many interlocking causes of the housing crisis. Most of them are various forms of injustice, but one of them that the city has a unilateral power to undo more simply than the others  is the single family only zoning policy. Its origin is in the politics of racism and wealth hoarding from the 1910s and after. It continues to serve no good purpose other than to require most of Oakland's land contain nothing but million dollar plus homes. Moving to end single family only zoning creates more options for moving properties into non-speculative ownership like community land trusts and co-ops.  So it is full of opportunities for housing more people without requiring the same level of tax dollars, although we also need the latter.  At the same time, it is important and welcome that the study specifies that we must prevent it from displacing renters or owners, even a few. As it says, it must also close the loop on maintaining fire safety and making sure it creates opportunities for low-income homeowners to add units while staying in Oakland, growing in place.  Second item, I strongly support the take up of macro in the Oakland Fire Department. It's one of many vital approaches to obtain true public safety. The police are simply not providing this. I hope it will be not just one of many programs the city funds, but something we look to regularly assess and adjust on a quick turnaround basis so that we can expand it quickly and bring its benefits to everyone.  Finally, I support Vice Mayor Kaplan's move to further fund rapid traffic calming and hope this gets more financial support going forward. Thank you and good afternoon.",Housing

And like many people today, I'm calling to voice support for MACRO, specifically being housed within the fire department and with temporary part-time employees through the communities that they'll be serving.  Having worked with a nonprofit agency, I've been in the field alone with clients in various crises, some with homicidal and suicidal ideation. I've driven a mom and her three kids, two of whom were suicidal, to the hospital and waited overnight with them. And I've been in an agency in the field where we've had to call the police. Even in situations where the police response was kind and appropriate, they lacked the mental health engagement and case management skills to give people what they really needed. The difference in response and outcome is remarkable. That said,  I'm in favor of staffing macro with temporary part-time workers from the city not contracting out to a nonprofit. Nonprofits are often understaffed and underfunded. Things can move very, very slowly. Reports and data may be sacrificed when staff has to choose between actively helping someone versus doing paperwork. They often don't have the structure to support the staff doing the work, which increases turnover.  It'll be much easier to have transparency and efficacy and the data that we'll need if everything is done by the city rather than contracted out. As we've, many people have brought up, we really do need that transparency in our processes right now, especially given the, we don't have our own cuts from the administration. Also, T is the familiarity report and, sorry, rapport and trust that community members can build with the people that they serve.  That's invaluable. It's what makes people willing to call for help, to calm down, feels like someone is on their side and understands their experience. That is not something that you can train for. We need to not underestimate the value of that experience. And we need to support the people who already know how to do this and get it moving quickly. Thank you.",Governance and Civic Engagement

Yet here in the richest country in the world, the shocking percentage of even a fully employed people can't afford it or find it straining their budgets to the breaking point. One obvious solution is to build more housing, and the CR Club strongly agrees with that goal.  I agree with Council Member Kaplan that the lack of adequate affordable housing in Oakland worsens traffic congestion and air pollution by pressuring people to live further away and drive more to get to their jobs, schools, and further that we should revise our policies so we can better address the housing crisis in a way that is effective, includes anti-displacement, which is very, very difficult to do, to stop displacement when you build new housing, and remedies historic exclusions.

I'm calling to support immediately implementing MACRO and putting the fire department, not police, in charge of crisis calls. A mental health or other crisis should not be a death sentence, yet that's what happened to Joshua Pollack and Marcellus Toney in Oakland in just the past couple of years. We need to bring MACRO in-house in the fire department, staffed by trained city workers, union workers who have experience working with communities suffering from mental health crises, state violence, addiction, and domestic violence.  Critically, MACRO must be set up with direction from a community advisory board led by folks with expertise providing mental health support to these same communities. The only way we can ensure that MACRO will truly reimagine public safety is by launching it now and staffing it immediately with temporary part-time city workers. This will ensure greater transparency and accountability and is also a vital opportunity to provide good family sustaining union jobs to open workers.  We already have workers trained in responding to mental health crisis at the county level and in community by groups like APTP and MH First that can offer voluntary advice and support. And I should add that without APTP's work over many years, we wouldn't even be talking about macro. So it's disturbing that we've seen a pattern of white community members spreading lies and engaging in coordinated attacks against Black-led organizations like APTP.  No more delays. Let's get macro up and running in six months. Oakland can begin saving lives today. It's time to establish macro as a city program that utilizes temporary staffers to launch this program immediately. I also want to condemn the proposal to use any COVID relief money for more cops. That idea is obscene.

Good afternoon to everyone. My name is Avery James, and I'm here to read on the record my regular comment that Libby Schaaf is a racist disgrace to Oakland and needs to resign effective immediately. My next comment is I'm also calling to throw my support behind any and all community-led initiatives that take funding away from Oakland police.  Oakland police has shown themselves to be exactly what we were talking about nationally when we were talking about defunding the police. They're ineffective, they're corrupt, and they take most of the city's budget to do all of those things. According to a report released by the Anti-Police Terror Project, Oakland police don't even spend most of their time on violent crime. And we're not even getting into how they show up after the fact of violent crime.  So what are we doing here by giving more money to them in such a deficit? That is a slap in the face. Nor do we need to hide and encourage their overspending as the rest of you would have us do by giving them more money to overspend in other measures. We see you. That's all my time and I concede it.

On behalf of the Coalition for Police Accountability, of which I'm a steering committee member, I want to thank some of the people who have brought us here today. First, I want to thank the steering committee of the coalition, and especially our member, Ann James, who spent so much time on research in person and Zoom calls to bring MACRO to Oakland. Vice Mayor Kaplan supported MACRO when it had no name and there was just community excitement for an idea. She remained a vocal advocate as Oakland community members developed the structure and the model it is today.  Thank you, Councilmember Gallo, for co-sponsoring the initial event, bringing cahoots down from Eugene to explain how a non-police response has worked over 30 years. Even then, Councilperson Gallo was a prophetic voice saying that MACRO should be housed in the fire department. Thanks to Councilmembers Kolb and Voss for nimbly restructuring where MACRO would be housed so that it can be rapidly implemented and for sponsoring this resolution.  Council Member Taylor's support is a good housekeeping seal of approval. He has been involved in details from the beginning, participating in every community table where Oaklanders developed the model that would address our unique needs, resources, and neighborhoods. Thank you to Council Members Tao, Reed, and Fife for your support. We will be reaching out to all of you to ensure that there is the political will to overcome any obstacles that matches the overwhelming community support.  I'd also like to thank all of the members of the coalition. And I'd like to thank the public in general for your support of MACRO. We will see this through. Thank you all for your support.

I am the  co-founder of the Anti-Police Terror Project and Executive Director of the Justice Teams Network. I would first like to thank Council Members Bass and Kalb. I don't think I've ever been so excited about a piece of legislation that represents true partnership between community labor and the folks that we elect to sit in those seats. I want to lift up Richard Perkins, Marcellus Toney, Yvette Henderson,  Miles Hall, Angelo Quinto, Natasha McKenna, just a snapshot of the names of people that have been murdered while in the middle of a mental health crisis. Some of the people I named are Oaklanders, some are not. The fact is that this is not an Oakland problem. This is a national problem. But Oakland has the chance to be the vanguard, to really do it right.  This conversation around mental health and ensuring that Oaklanders had access to 24-7 mental health care and that it didn't leave with a badge and a gun started six years ago with APTP and the defund OPD campaign. It started because of bloody 2015, where the Oakland Police Department murdered 11 Black men and our mayor said nothing.  She was actually on tour with then-Chief Wendt, hailing the progress of the Oakland Police Department. And then, of course, it was 2016 when Celeste Crawford revealed that OPD was part of 14 law enforcement agencies that engaged in a rape trafficking scandal.  It has taken way too long to get here, but we are here and we're pleased that other organizations have decided to push for and engage in the process. I'm here to say that we can do this in four to six months. We do this by putting it through the fire department. We do it because labor has agreed to use temporary workers and the training that we're talking about, it's not just how to check vitals. If this is gonna be transformative, we need our people to be trained by the experts on the ground  in everything from de-escalation to how they decolonize their mind about the stigmatization of mental health.

I'm hoping at this point that all the council members are already in support of MACRO and before you today is how it should be implemented. And I want to support it going through the fire department. We need accountability and having it part of a city department will help ensure we have transparency and accountability.  Raising quality of life and having positions, these positions, good union jobs is also working towards equity. So the way macro is implemented matters. And let's get a good equity solution that includes equity.  hiring local black and brown people who live in our community. I also want to lift up James Vann's comment about how we implement the four plexus. Again, how we do things matter. We can get additional housing that only is affordable to people with lots of money, or we can get additional housing that addresses the needs of people with less money. So let's make sure  We address equity in everything that gets implemented. No COVID relief funds should go to OPD. In fact, no additional funds should ever go to OPD at this point. Why are we reimagining if we're going to keep giving them money? I enjoyed the person's comment who said, didn't understand how they were helping address sideshows. They're just sitting around watching the sideshows happen.  And I don't want any of my tax dollars to go to a ballpark at Howard Terminal. We keep hearing there's not going to be tax dollars spent and we know that's not true. There's always stuff that costs taxpayer dollars. So no taxpayer dollars going there, please.

I support that the police area five actually needs more community resource officers as we have benefited in the past from community-based policing as opposed to traditional policing. And area five has been disproportionately only had like one CRO compared to other areas. I also support the expansion to shot spotters in the Eastmont Hills and in B30Y, specifically from Nate Avenue up through Skyline and Keller Avenue.  I also support that the council needs to restore the sorely needed positions that we need to dismantle the sideshows, restore active foot patrol and reinstate youth programs to help vulnerable youth stay off the streets to get back in the classroom as COVID regulations are lifted. I also support traffic and parking enforcement. Our area suffers from hazardous traffic and vehicle abandonment. Vehicle abandonment is often associated with drug violence and gun violence.  And I also support funding to the DOT to accelerate and expedite the Department of Transportation projects in key areas.  We also need clean streets. In order to get this, I feel like we should fund the excess litter fee program. ELF has had supplemental funding from the city budget to combat litter and keep our streets clean.

We are a member of the Refund Oakland Coalition, which is a community and labor coalition that's calling on Oakland City leadership to prioritize resources and investment in vital public services and public sector jobs. We're also a member of the Defund Oakland OPD Coalition and support the effort to redirect money from OPD towards programs and services that truly keep our community safe, including the macro program as proposed.  As an organization that works to build power and raise standards for low-wage workers, eBay stands with refund in calling on the council and mayor to create a just recovery budget that ensures all Oaklanders, particularly black and brown Oaklanders living in the flatlands are taken care of. We must build better than before and address the inequalities that COVID revealed and exacerbated. As Oakland receives $192 million in direct federal aid, the city must ensure that these resources are used to provide relief for those who need it most.  In particular, eBase urges the city to hire, rehire laid off frontline city workers, restore vital services such as our shuttered fire stations and street cleaning, and to invest in community resources like our parks and libraries. As such, we support agenda item S18 by Vice Mayor Kaplan to use the money both from the Coliseum JPA and the American Rescue Plan Act to undo unilateral cuts by the administration and restore these crucial services.  Over the long run, we need revenue solutions that ask big corporations and developers to start paying their share to invest in our city. eBase urges the council to pass the proposed budget amendments, which include unfreezing the deputy director position for the Department of Workplace and Employment Standards. This position is critical to ensure that our essential workers' rights are protected.  This council has taken remarkable leadership over the last year in adopting emergency paid sick leave, emergency hazard pay, and right to recall legislation in response to the ongoing pandemic.

I live in the Fairfax neighborhood in District 4 and I work at one of the largest public health nonprofits in the state. I'm distressed to hear that the city is promoting macro as an alternative to policing and item S-21 on one hand, which I support, while also calling to divert funding from the COVID relief bill to increase...  money to OPD for sideshow and other policing hidden under item S 18. That sounds like a bait and switch. The COVID stimulus funds need to go to action, heal and repair, not just the impact of COVID, but also to address all the systemic inequities that made the disparity so deep in the first place in our black and brown communities, not to pay more cops.  What I know as a public health professional is that the root causes that are responsible for the devastating impact of COVID in our black and brown neighborhoods of Oakland are the same kinds of non-policing solutions our communities need to have power and resilience. Those things are housing, food security, a living wage, livable neighborhoods, access to the same educational opportunities as kids in wealthier, whiter neighborhoods.  It's a slap in the face to the folks who are suffering from the multi-pronged impacts of death and economic devastation from the pandemic and police violence to take money that could help build communities up and heal to the cops when that is clearly not what the people of Oakland have asked for or voted for.

My name is Judy Elkin, and I am a member of HOG and Shelter Oak.  and a resident of District 3. And I just wanted to say that I support advancing the MACRO program immediately by putting the fire department, not police, in charge of mental health crisis calls. MACRO must be staffed by city workers and trained staff who have expertise in working with communities suffering from mental health, addiction, and domestic violence as survivors of state violence. It must be set up with direction from community advisory boards, led by folks with experience providing mental health support,  to survivors of state violence. Macro must and can be implemented immediately by hiring temporary part-time workers  Doing so will ensure real accountability to the people of Oakland by relying on staff hired directly by the city and not outside contractors. Staffing macro with city workers would also provide necessary and secure union jobs for Oaklanders. Police shooting victims are often in the midst of a mental health crisis as much as a quarter of all police shootings in 2019. Oakland has already lost too many of its own, including Joshua Pollack, Richard Perkins,  and Demuria Hogg due to the city's broken system of relying on cops to respond to mental health crises. A report published by the Anti-Police Terror Project last week found only 4% of all service calls to Oakland Police Department are for violent crime and medical calls for service was 10% of calls in 2019. This new data clearly tells us that the vast majority of police time is spent on things we don't need to pay cops to do.  The time is now to ensure that people of Oakland have access to a life-saving, not a life-ending mental health crisis response team. The only way that we can ensure that MACRA will truly reimagine police public safety is by launching it now and staffing it immediately with temporary part-time workers. Doing so will ensure greater transparency with the public.",Public Safety and Law Enforcement

I'm the policy director of the Anti-Police Terror Project, longtime supporter of MACRA within the fire department. I have led the defund OPD campaign for the last five years. During that time, the Schaff administration has repeatedly failed to hold OPD accountable. This lack of accountability shows up in many ways. Most relevant to the current moment, despite two OPD audits over the last decade, Mayor Schaff has not even attempted to rein in OPD overspending. In fact, OPD overspending has increased over time,  This year, they overspent by $32 million. As a result of OPD overspending, Mayor Schaaf and City Administrator Ed Reskin decided unilaterally to cut services, a power that I was not and am not aware that they had or have under the current circumstances. This included cuts to OPD. It was the administration's decision to do so and the direct result of their reckless actions. After making those cuts, the administration chose to blame Council President Boss and local organizers for, quote, defunding the police, falsely attributing recent acts of violence to our move.  Again, these were cuts made by the administration without even city council input. Now, months later, the city administration is again trying to make unilateral spending decisions despite their long and detailed history of financial mismanagement, mismanagement that has directly led us to the current situation.  Last summer, when Ed Reskin proposed that we spend $905,000 of Measure Q funds intended to support the unhoused on OPD's homelessness services unit is one example. Now, the administration is attempting to spend CARES Act dollars to fund the homelessness services unit. And because they know that there is a city council that won't give OPD a blank check, they have responded by claiming they have the power to make budget decisions unilateral. We all know that 4.2% of service calls to OPD  are for violent crime and 7% are for property crime. We do not know how OPD is justifying the additional 89% of service calls. Finally, it's worth noting that OPD's data practices are so poor that the analysts that we hired to analyze that data recommended that the practices be improved immediately. Thank you.",Police Reform

I live in District 7 and I'm a member of the Anti-Police Terror Project and the Justice Teams Network. I, like many others, am calling in about MACRO. I'm obviously in total support of MACRO and just wanted to add a few points in line with much of what has been said. Personally, I've worked as a sexual assault counselor and first responder for a sexual assault response team, a sexual assault prevention educator,  A long-time shelter and crisis line worker, a youth counselor, and a suicide prevention educator. I've been in many crisis situations more than I can count, and there are several things that I can say very confidently. Police are not the correct first responders for mental health crisis, substance use, or intimate partner violence. In my experience, when police showed up during these kinds of crises, the situation was negatively escalated, and we never reached a solution that in any way centered the well-being of the person in crisis.  And sometimes the police officer harmed or arrested the person in crisis, worsening their situation and causing immense trauma and pain, not to mention exacerbating the crisis and worsening their situation through bail costs, jail time, time missed from work, lost wages, stolen personal effects, PTSD and trauma and more. We know for a fact that many people murdered by police are in the midst of a mental health crisis, up to 25% of all police murders. The risk that we are putting community members in by not providing any alternative but the police is unconscionable.  We must fund, support, and promote alternative responses that do not put our community members at risk of harm or death. We need macro, and we need the fire department to be in charge of it, not the police. Additionally, macro must be staffed by city workers and trained staff who have experience working with community members dealing with mental health crises, domestic violence, state violence, and addiction. We also need an advisory board made up of people with experience providing mental health support to survivors of state violence.  We already have workers trained in responding to mental health crises by the county and also by community groups like Mental Health First and Communities United for Restorative Justice, among others. Centering the expertise of these kinds of groups will ensure responders are informed and understand the community that they are serving.",Public Safety and Law Enforcement

It was their repeated message that their interactions with OPD were overwhelmingly negative and that when there was an emergency, they needed someone else to call that caused the ongoing discussions that led to bringing cahoots down to discuss their model.  We want to thank the Oakland Police Commission for their ongoing support and interest in macro. We have a deep appreciation for the Urban Strategy Council for their one year's long work researching alternative models and bringing together many community activists and organizations and other stakeholders in developing a model which reflects the needs, resources, and neighborhoods of Oakland.  We thank SEIU 1021 and IAFF Local 55 for their support, especially to ensure we can overcome any obstacles to implement MACRO rapidly and effectively. And thank you to Oaklanders who support MACRO as it desperately needed an emergency response for a broad range of nonviolent calls that do not require police. Always looking forward, organizations and congregations in East and West Oakland are already planning meetings to support and engage pilot neighborhoods in the implementation of the MACRO pilot.  Thanks especially to Faith in Action East Bay and Interfaith Council of Alameda County, among others, who have committed to working together so most impacted neighbors will be engaged around macro implementation, participation, feedback, and oversight.",Police Reform

I've been here for 10 years and I've been in the Bay for my entire life.  I was calling in support of the MACRO program as well. The funding should be routed to the fire department and to actual mental health professionals that can handle these situations. As we've seen, there have been just tragedies when OPD responds to this. OPD does not keep us safe. The community has actually had to start creating our own programs of just other community members to go and help in mental health situations. And I want to give a big shout out to APTP.  for doing a lot of work with that because people are scared to call OPD because OPD is terrorizing our community. For those of you who don't know, there was the whole writer's case about 20 years ago. We were given a bunch of money to reform OPD. Those reforms are still not in place. 20 years later, OPD is raping and trafficking minors like Celeste Guap. We want them defunded. We want them gone. We want people who can actually deal with these crises.  to be dealing with them. And I would just like to also second the person who said that Libby Schaff is a racist. Libby Schaff do not use the anti-Asian violence as an excuse to try to get funding back to OPD. Studies have shown that increased funding for police does not cut down on crime. Increased funding for community programs is what cuts down on crime. That's all. I yield my time.",Police Reform

I think it's crucial to have transparency as to how we got here regarding the cuts made.  and what spending was authorized versus unauthorized, et cetera. We can't say the city's budget woes come from COVID alone when we know that there was overspending unrelated to it. The budgets of city departments like CPRA and others provide valuable services to the citizens of Oakland. Right now, CPRA is severely understaffed due to the hiring freeze, and that hurts the community. If anything, we and other departments will need more funding moving forward, not less.  And supporting our workers is supporting the Oakland community and works toward achieving the city's goals of equity. We also, I urge that we have community input on what to use federal relief funds on as well. It can't just be a blank check for the administration.

Several people alluded to Lake Merritt had nothing to do with race. It did have a lot to do with race because you called in the Office of Race Equity who reported to be aware of the sensitivity of African-Americans being a major part of what you're going to do.  Today, Cobb alluded to budget items that are not on the budget have to come to council for approval. That didn't happen with the Lake Merritt Pryor program. It never came to council for discussion or budget approval. Joe Degrees said that he had information that African-Americans had approved certain components of the Lake Merritt plan  He produced no evidence. And that's got to stop. That's my major point. Keep saying that African-Americans are involved in things when you don't have data. The next thing is that the Stop AAPI Hate group produced information in your ordinance around the 3,800 people. But it was reported on CNN on March the 18th  that that group doesn't independently verify any of the reports that it receives. Reports do not have information from crime reports of police departments. The issue of African-Americans, it's a shame that on Saturday I heard a congressman, U.S. congressman from the House of Representatives, a Black man named Hank Johnson, speak to the fact that African-Americans are prejudiced  and bigoted around Asian Americans.

I've been thinking a lot about the trash and Mr. Hazard brought up a few meetings ago about how this is not a new problem to Oakland. And it seems like a lot of problems in Oakland aren't new. We just need new ways of solving them. And I was thinking, and I just wanna throw this out there,  that maybe part of the problem with our illegal dumping problem is that we're seeing these things as trash. And that really, you know, we like to blame the homeless and encampments for our garbage problem. But the truth is these things do come from people's homes and from people's storage units and from businesses. It's not the homeless going out, buying lots of things and bringing them outside. So maybe there is a way that we could  get people who are housed or people who have things that they're trying to get rid of that are still perfectly good and get them into some type of recycling program, like start some type of city, you know, free store where people could donate items, where people could donate items that other people could come and pick through instead of, you know, cause a lot of things aren't necessarily trash. And then I just wanted to uplift that I went by the tennis courts  And hopefully that trash, they had taken such great length to bring their trash outside of the courts. And as of last Thursday, and I haven't been by there, hopefully it's been picked up, but they had been waiting for days for that garbage to be picked up. And then other people were adding to it.

And it was a very long, detailed report. It was very startling. It pointed to a lot of issues, really, really concerning issues we have in Oakland that we need solutions to and out of the box thinking about.  But when it came time to discuss, I was really, really alarmed that the conversation immediately went to sideshows. And the word sideshow did not appear once in the report. That's because injuries and deaths at sideshows are almost unheard of. They may seem like a really dangerous thing when you look at them and people don't like them. And they are potentially dangerous. But we know that most of the deaths and most of the injuries in our city are happening from people's everyday actions.  in driving and not in organized sideshows. It was alarming to me because it showed how disinterested the city council is in actual results that help people and save lives and how much more focused they are on complaints that they're getting through emails and phone calls from constituents.

A WHO report notes that noise can cause health problems such as sleep disturbance, cardiovascular effects, poor work and school performance, and hearing impairment. It recommends less than 30 decibels in bedrooms.  and less than 35 decibels in classrooms. Of late, amplified music in Lakeside Park at the boathouse parking lot lasts for eight hours or more, lasting well past midnight at levels up to 125 decibels. The noise has been measured at over 90 decibels a quarter of a mile away. This is the equivalent to the sound of an alarm clock, one that you can't turn off for hours while you're trying to have a conversation, read, watch TV, do homework, or sleep.  It is more than unpleasant, it is unhealthy. Even the birds are leaving their erstwhile sanctuary. The park is supposed to close at sundown.

The situation this past Sunday was out of hand, where  We literally could not get out of our home because there were cars and bikes parked in our driveway, cars double, triple parked. And it's really reached a point now where this is a true public safety issue. I spoke last week at the Lake Merritt meeting and I shared a story in which I had my two-month-old daughter and we were looking to have medication delivered on a weekend. And the conditions at Lake Merritt were so bad that I couldn't get that delivery. And I had to take my child and walk four blocks to meet a delivery driver somewhere where they can get  So they can get me access to my daughter's medication. This is not hyperbolic. This is not being dramatic when I say this situation is literally putting my child's health and safety in jeopardy. And I know there's a very strong narrative that a lot of this is just higher income white people who do not want to be around people of color. And it's not as simple as that. People of color live here. I live in a building that is half people of color owned.  And we feel like our voice and our story in this is getting completely erased. And these issues are really displacing people. Everyone that I know who lives in my building is actively looking to leave. I've had many friends who live in the neighborhood who have left because the conditions are truly unsafe, where emergency services can't make it down Lake Shore. The noise makes it unbearable. I can't keep my child in certain parts of my home. And...  Our voice matters too. And I'm looking for kind of strong support for Council Member Abbas's proposal for the lake as a way to kind of strike a balance and reset the tone at the lake where you can have kind of proper oversight of certain vending activities like some of them that are happening at Embarcadero, but is in more partnership and puts the safety of the community as well.

I've lived by Lake Merritt for 23 years and I want people to come and enjoy the lake, but we have seen a significant decline in the safety situation and the escalating situation is dangerous and harmful.  for all the reasons outlined in the administrator's report. This is about protecting Lake Merritt residents and visitors' health and safety. And given Lake Merritt is a destination for all Oaklanders, this is a city-wide issue. We want what any community wants, to live in a safe place where we can come and go as needed, where emergency vehicles can get through when seconds matter. The past two weekends, fire trucks were unable to get through Lakeshore Avenue.  Where people with disabilities and families with strollers can walk on the sidewalk and not have dozens of motorbikes, hundreds of vendors and large crowds blocking the way, basically pushing them out to the middle of the street to get through. We want a public park where families and kids can come and not have full alcohol bars and drugs sold feet away and noise at deafening levels being played.  We don't want sideshows and racing cars and motorcycles going up and down the streets. Last night there was a fire at the Junior Center and gunshots at Lakeshore and Brooklyn within minutes of each other. Fireworks went off late into the night and those are often pointed at residences. There have been two separate homicides at Grand and Perkins. I urge you to approve this budget measure.  And to implement the measures outlined right away. And we need the interventions to start this weekend. Given the current situation, we need consistent enforcement and cooperation with parking, municipal code, and OPD to work together to better organize compliance. And the proposed budget is necessary in order to make the interventions effective because the safety issues return and escalate once temporary programs end.

I have lived at the lake for nearly nine years now, and the last few years, particularly the last year, has seen a drastic decline in the quality of life at the lake and the surrounding areas. Every weekend we're subjected to excessive noise and traffic. Our fire lanes, bicycle lanes, and driveways are blocked, and an excessive amount of trash is being left everywhere. I'm tired of having to clean up the trash on Mondays. I'm tired of hearing the sounds of revving engines, squealing tires, and loud music vibrating through my home all day long.  I'm tired of phoning Oakland police to report cars blocked in my driveway or any multitude of other illegal activities to receive little or no response. I'm tired of the park's grass being used as a parking lot. I'm tired of feeling trapped in my home or worse, feeling like I need to escape my home every weekend. I'm tired of seeing Oakland's Jewel, a wildlife refuge, being turned into a flea market.  After last weekend's meeting, we were told that the changes would start immediately. But this past weekend was probably the worst weekend this year. I live near El Embarcadero and the amount of trash at the lake and in our neighborhoods this morning is appalling. The volume of amplified music and other noise, including the revving engines and squealing tires was unbearable. The traffic that comes down our street is often at high speeds and our neighbors couldn't let their children play outside. The noise went on until late in the night. And then sadly, of course, there was the fire at the art center.  The answer to these problems is simple. The city needs to enforce the existing laws and rules. There should be no vending, no amplified music, no illegal parking. The trash and the graffiti needs to get cleaned up. The Lake's use should be safe and equitable for both residents and visitors. But sadly, it's no longer safe where families can come from all backgrounds to enjoy a peaceful picnic. The suggestion of finding a permanent place for vendors around Lake Merritt is ludicrous. We pay taxes for our safety to be protected.  The lake, its wildlife, its visitors, and its residents deserve better than this. Thank you.",Parks and Recreation

I live on the Bellevue Grandside of Lake Merritt where two bullets entered apartments during the latest murder. Last night I watched the Art and Science Center on Bellevue burn down. When did it become okay for cars to drive the wrong way on one-way streets?  to double park all day blocking roadways and driveways, to destroy park lawns and race motorcycles without mufflers through park streets? When did it become okay for people to consume alcohol at the lake, to drop their garbage out their car windows in front of someone's residence, to shit or pee in a public park?  to play loud amplified music all night long in front of people's homes. I've lived here for 21 years. This is not the Oakland I know. I love the lake and I want every Oaklander of every race and color to enjoy it and respect it, but this is not about equitable use of the park. This is now a public health and safety crisis. I am shocked and alarmed that Oakland city officials have allowed the activities  at Lake Merritt to degenerate into the chaos that makes life completely unbearable every day of the week for local residents. What does equitable use of the lake mean? That we lower the health and safety standards and quality of life around here to the lowest common denominator? Or that we elevate people by sharing a beautiful, quiet place with everyone in Oakland? What draws people to Lake Merritt now? Not the beauty of this gem in the middle of a city, not the sanctity of the bird sanctuary,  the grassy areas for family picnics or the opportunity to throw breadcrumbs to the ducks and geese. What draws people to Lake Merritt now is the fact that there's no police enforcement of any illegal activity. You can come from anywhere and sell whatever you want. You can do whatever you want here. So why go someplace where there are laws that are enforced? This has nothing to do with equitable use. It has to do with lack of will to protect your own park and your own citizens. It's a disaster waiting to happen.",Public Safety and Law Enforcement

I'd like to share some ways in which the lack of immediate, well-funded and sustained interventions at the lake is threatening the safety and health of residents of color like me. As one council member's LEC comments last week illustrated, there is a stereotype that the only people negatively impacted  But the unmanaged chaos at the lake are, to paraphrase the council member, white people who don't want to see dark-skinned people in their neighborhood. This narrative creates permission not to financially prioritize the lake since the status quo's perceived beneficiaries are POC and perceived losers are wealthier white residents. But that is not reality. Many people of color live near Lake Merritt. The rapidly deteriorating conditions have had substantial negative impacts on us and are driving us out of the community.  I am a black woman and my apartment overlooks the lake. I love our diverse community. I love seeing people who look like me and experiencing joy in spaces like Lake Merritt. And until recently, I was excited to explore potentially buying a home here. But living here is now an unsafe nightmare. The impact on my mental health became so bad that I've had to temporarily relocate. I would really like to come home, but I get anxious thinking about what awaits me.  The city's ineffectiveness has created a home environment that makes it impossible to be effective at my public service job or spend time in my apartment without constant anxiety causing literal physical symptoms. Other longtime working class POC residents have been forced out of their units. My building is half POC. We all talk about moving. Unless the city makes an ongoing commitment to managing Lake Merritt, starting with this budget allocation, it will perpetuate the very marginalization of black and brown people it seeks to combat.  Viewing interventions at the lake as somehow antagonistic to the needs of POC makes us feel invisible and erasing our experiences to oversimplify a challenging policy area is not true racial equity. Please take the step now to move beyond triage and into effective policymaking.",Homelessness

You know, in this debate, the city has already conceded in two reports that the conditions at the lake, all around the lake, are dangerous, unhealthy, and present a public health and safety crisis that must be fixed starting now.  The budget allocation proposal by council member Bass to address some immediate threats should be passed by this city council today. It's clearly not enough, but it's a start. The fire at the junior center last night is tragic and yet symbolic. Our park infrastructure and environment is being burned down and safe spaces for our youth are no longer a priority.  Somehow, the commercial desires of a few have taken center stage over the park needs of many. Vending really should be moved away from the lake to more suitable venues. I understand there's an economic crisis that has driven the pilot program. It's not a permanent solution.  And I want to speak to Mayor Schaaf. Mayor Schaaf, be prepared to sharpen your budget pencil and include some fulsome funding in the next budget cycle to enforce existing public safety laws and restore this lake as an equitable park.  where Oaklanders can return to picnic, learn about nature, and recreate. Budgeting is key, and we need to plan not just for the next eight weeks or 12 weeks, we need to plan for the next two years. And city council members, if Mayor Schaaf returns a budget that's not adequate to address this crisis, you must act and you must fill in the funding gap.

The traffic congestion into one lane right at that point kept the fire truck from being able to pass by because  there was people who are in the red zone, the red zone. And then in front of our church, we have a white zone. And on Saturday, even with red handicap cones there, it was full of cars at the lake that stayed there all day, isolating the church, keeping our handicapped parishioners from being able to  be dropped off or parked. It's incredibly awful. And I've been waiting and concerned about this Holy Week, Good Friday and Easter, which we have to have services both outside as well as inside in order to accommodate the people.

Yesterday was the worst day ever at the lake. It's unconscionable what goes on there. I've lived here since 1999.  after working as a nurse for 30 years, and we moved here because of the neighborhood and the lake and the diversity in Oakland. My husband and I tried to drive out Bellevue Avenue, and the double parking was so bad that it was impossible for a fire truck to get through in any way.  There was also double parking on Grand Avenue. The food trucks that were just approved, it was a huge mistake. Everyone is double parked so they can get out of their car and order food. Other people have explained about the noise, the motorcycles, the music. To my mind, the culmination of inaction  by elected officials is the burning down of the nature center. There was a homeless gentleman that lived on the deck. We have called and called and called about him living there and the danger it might cause. And nothing was done and nothing's been done about the out of control lake.  It's kind of deplorable what's going on. And I don't understand why there has been no action.

I'm the East Bay Field Director with SEIU 1021, and I am also a member of the Refund Coalition.  I'm here to demand using the ARPA funds and the upcoming budgetary process for Adjust Recovery, one which prioritizes housing, protecting our essential workers, and maintaining and expanding critical city services. Adjust Recovery means transparent and accountable budget process that provides for public input and one where city council is making the decisions on how to allocate ARPA funds. There are two problems I see us dealing with right now. One is a lack of trust between the administration and the community,  about the legitimacy of budget shortfalls and cuts, and two, is a set of administration priorities that differs from the demands of community and labor. These issues demand full transparency and accountability to overcome. We need a detailed line by line report on the budget shortfall and expenditure savings that have been implemented, a close review of the Harvey Rose report, and a detailed line by line plan on how to allocate the funds to the existing fiscal year  and the next budget in a manner that supports city services and community. Open residents spoke loudly in November for the new city council. We voted in the midst of a pandemic to elect the leaders who would lead us out of that pandemic. And we now expect the city administration to acknowledge that voice of the voters and provide the city council with the full transparency and information they need to make the right decisions for our community. And since I have about 30 seconds left, I just want to add that SEIU 1021  had hundreds, over 500 temporary part-time workers who have been released from employment due to the pandemic. Many of these workers do not have the same protections as permanent civil service workers, and we need to get these people back. They are more than a line item. Many of these people have been working for the city for decades, and they deserve to be restored fully. Thank you.",Governance and Civic Engagement

I moved to Bellevue Avenue five years ago, mostly because of the lake and the diversity, racial and economic and social that brings people here and wanting to live with it. But now Lake Merritt and the park are dying from lack of law enforcement.  This affects not only us residents on all sides of the lake, but also other Oaklanders who want to use the park and the lake and used to be able to enjoy it in safe and healthy conditions. Other great American urban parks, think about Golden Gate Park, Central Park in New York, Millennium Park in Chicago, are successfully serving the needs of all their diverse residents. But Oakland is failing.  The park is a disaster for everyone except late night party goers, unregulated food vendors of alcohol, drugs, and trash, criminals, and rats. Who is the city protecting when it completely abdicates its law enforcement responsibility? Not the people who elected the council. Not the people whose needs and interests would be served by responsible action and regulation.  Only the people whose needs are served by what the city has been doing up to now. And that is nothing. Council Member Bass's proposal is a good start. I would urge you to adopt it, but also go farther, make it permanent, take other necessary measures to restore what has brought so many of us to the center of Oakland and helped its revitalization.

About the idea of a shuttle, I support that things are chaotic and needing some change at the market, but I do support there being events there and being held. I've actually liked seeing the community and having some events out. Regarding  The budget report and the other items, I just wanna speak out like many others and say that we absolutely need transparency with the budget process. We need you all as well as the community to take a very thorough look at the budget report, to look for inconsistencies that are absolutely there, including in the amount of the administrative reductions that were made  last year. Those amounts differ and there's a number of things in that report that are a bit mismatched, but I do support a just recovery that services should not be cut by the administration, that should be handled by council in the interest of the community in a public process. The ARPA money should not go to policing. It should be within the purview of the council and it should be used along with  the ideals from the public safety, the reimagining task force and in those same lines to not focus on strictly on enforcement.

I haven't looked at the agenda as closely as he has. And item number five is the one that I think we need to take more notice of.

Keeping people, this idea that there are so many people that are temporary part-time workers that are doing this permanently is really an outrage to their work. Many of them were let go right around Christmas time and we saw the mess, the garbage piling up around the city because we didn't have the workers and no one knew about this decision. They just saw this sudden mess. So when, it's pure lawlessness that when the city council passes a budget that the administration does not follow that budget.  It must be followed. I also support Council President Bass as my council member and her trying to work on the problems at the lake. I was down there for a minute Sunday.

I just wanted to thank the council for coming together on these resolutions and transparency is definitely something we need in our budget process. Housing is a human right, of course, and with the lake,  I don't know. You know, there's a lot of talk about the army base. And I know that I've talked to a lot of unhoused people who are interested in maybe even though it's way out there, you know, creating a community, maybe having their own store. I want to talk about solutions right now, like, you know, with the lake as well, maybe part of the army base could be a permanent vending facility.  um ground concerts again i mean part of the problem is people have just been locked up for a year and they want to get outside and they want to be with their friends and then um you know the lake has been just a great place to congregate but obviously it has a threshold and um i think that we need to think of solutions of where we have spaces in oakland because we do have the best weather and it does seem like a great economic recovery  to have people get licensed and get their businesses off the ground. It seems like all the efforts that have been going on at the lake have been really successful in helping people become legitimate businesses. And that can continue, I think. And I think that Oakland does have a history of overlooking things sometimes. And sometimes that goes against the community. And sometimes that goes for people who are very entrepreneurial and there's a good side and a bad side. I feel like  Oakland really does possess the best and the worst of any city I've ever lived in.

That's when Black people made a conscious decision to invest in the lake to deal with that issue of racism. Also, you have a pilot program. That's my issue. How you implemented this pilot program to deal with Lake Merritt. It never came to Congress.  $200,000 was allocated to it without any kind of council approval. You also had within that program, the departments in the city administration making decisions. Taylor just said today, we should not move forward without first making sense of what we're doing. Did not do that with the pilot program. Gallo said, we don't trust what the administration is doing.  Providing to us. But you did that with the late merit pilot program because it's black people. You can do things that are not correct as it relates to the ordinance. The ordinance speaks to data that provides substance to the fact that we are dealing with hate.  But you don't say hate crimes. You say hate discrimination. You also say that the organization AAPI provided that data of 3,800 victims of hate incidents. That data is not police reports of crime. That data is people calling in to say that they have been a victim in some way. Have a process that validates that people are truly experiencing  hate crimes or hate incidents. You have to separate the two. I don't like the way Black people are being perpetrators of hate crimes against Asian Americans when that is not the fact. There are no facts to support that, that we are engaging in that purposely.",Governance and Civic Engagement

So you have lapdogs sitting on the mayor's lap  who wants to diminish the role what's happening to Black folks. With regards to 2.3, you got an item that's sponsored by President Bass and Chiang Tao on anti-Asian sentiment. Now, all of a sudden, this is an urgency. When it comes to Black folks, nothing's ever an urgency, Chiang Tao. Nothing. You look the other way.  We have a disparity study. Nobody looked at proposing a resolution. It's unsubstantiated. You don't even identify the source from which you identify your information. There's no staff report. And it hasn't gone through any subject matter committee, like the Public Safety Committee.  This resolution is off the hook. How do you make this an emergency matter? Bring a resolution that impacts Black folks in this city. There's never been a resolution directed at Black folks. And how is identifying Asians, oh, they're not people of color. You identify their cultural heritage, but when it comes to Black folks, you end up telling us we're people of color. And I'm tired of it.  Tired of it. With regards to the issue around the lake, move all the vendors over into the amphitheater. Cut off East 12th and Lakeside. Have the vendors go over that end and you avoid a traffic problem along Lakeshore.  And I feel what the residents are saying along the Lakeshore corridor.

Why not San Francisco? And you just think to yourself how, well, Oakland is the greatest city I've ever lived in.  And how would you know? And I feel like the administration, and I don't even think it's just this administration. I think it's for decades. This is what my impression is starting to be. The administration has treated Oakland that way with our own money.  Like, I really think this started when they destroyed 7th Street and they had the technology to put the BART underground and they made that racist decision to clear 7th Street and put the BART above ground. Because it could have been underground just like downtown and we could have preserved another jewel of Oakland.  And I just think we're still haven't even begun to make up for that fact. And I'm really hoping because it was really beautiful to start hearing this new voice of accountability because it's our budget. It's the community's money, really. And I just don't think that Oakland has a history of being good to the community with our own budget. And I just think it's gone on for decades.  And it has to stop. And it's going to be the community really who stops it. And that's not the fault of any elected officials because that's how real change comes because everyone's passed the baton. You know, we just, we hide money. We, we, we,  Lie about money, we manipulate, and we allow bullies to thrive in Oakland. I think there's really a bully culture here, and it runs, I think, even into our government, and it's going to end. I really feel that, you know, but it's going to be the people, we the people, who are going to have to insist. So a priority is, yes, the homeless.

Just before Council Member Fife spoke, I was sitting here thinking, I wonder if anybody sitting on the virtual dais felt like they got real value out of today. This was a lot of time, but it wasn't what I was thinking it was going to be.  It was more like what I heard from Council Member Fife. There was an opportunity when Council Member Kaplan called out the issue of the East Oakland businesses being robbed and all the police officers at the protest to stop there and say,  Let's make an agreement that we're not going to spend our tax dollars policing protests. Can we all agree to that? That's a basis for the underlying problem that's happening here. We have council members who still think the problem is that police didn't get the right amount of money instead of calling out how the money is being used.  That's the discussion that I thought would happen today. We're supposed to reimagine, reimagine, but there was no reimagining happening today. I don't know anything really different. I enjoyed some of the personal stories, but I don't know anything different than I knew before about where council members stand on the budget.  There's so few opportunities for you all to have a conversation and not to have the conversation that went deep about what kind of compromises people are gonna be, how you're gonna get to an equity, not an equality budget. The conversation at the beginning about how you deal with your district,  Versus the city of a whole. No district is even the same.

However, what we have going on is a lot of misrepresentation of data, examples.  Lake Merritt yesterday on the discussion, Joe Degrees said that African-Americans supported something for which he had nothing except to say, I haven't been able to put the data together. The survey around Lake Merritt was 92% of individuals who live outside of the Lake Merritt community. The report on the Oakland Fund for Children and Youth  misrepresented that African-American youth were getting the most of the services, and that was incorrect. The Chinese data related to hate crime, the organization that provides the data, also states that they are unable to validate the data that they collect by survey. The STOP data by the Oakland Police Department  reflects that there's been a decrease in stops on African-Americans. There's been a decrease in the numbers, but the disproportionality of how many African-Americans are stopped is the same almost. As it relates to homelessness, you will not have a count until 2022, the last count, 2019. How are you going to move forward with no data to support where you need to be going?  Ceasefire. Ceasefire is repeatedly represented as being successful. There is no data to support the evidence that ceasefire provides resources or services to the individuals that need it.

Because there's a lot of homeless people out here that need some type of money from this budget to be put towards them and their housing, making sure that they have somewhere to go and be. I was just homeless, and I've been fighting with the city for over a year and a half to have my key redone for my car because they took my stuff up in an eviction. So  It's just kind of hard for me knowing that you guys are getting a lot of money and it's not being spent the way it should be on housing homeless people. You guys are looking at other areas, but you need to be thinking about the homeless people and focusing on making the streets more safer without the homeless people in it. Because we don't have nowhere to go if you guys aren't giving us the money that's allocated for us. If that don't happen,  then there's going to be a whole bunch of problems on these streets and they don't need to get that way. They just need to be taken care of in the proper way. And people need to respond to people's messages. I've called a ton of many times and I haven't got no response back in regards to our storage containers and things that we have had. They never showed us where it was. And now they're trying to go back on a,  legal binding negotiations we had. And I don't think that's right for us. People just don't choose to be homeless. Things happen for them to become homeless. And that's what happened to me. I'm just not somebody that wants to be living on the streets. I'm used to a nice house, having things. And now I can't do nothing because of my car. And it's not fair. So I hope you guys take a heed to what I'm asking you guys to do with this budget and  Thank you and have a good day.",Homelessness

And we should be encouraging and creating a city where people come from all over the country to hang out in our perfect weather and hang out with our people and eat our food and buy our art and ride bicycles. And the budget should really reflect what the community, how we want to grow our city.  Not our past.

Significant decrease in the black population and growth in the Latino and Asian  the Asian Pacific population. That's because you give prioritization to those communities. Blacks are the highest rate of rent bearers, along with Latinos. You give data on wages, but you don't mention that blacks are the lowest wage earners. Blacks are the largest group not working and also  When you look at college readiness, Blacks 39%, Latinos 69% and 64%.

My name is Benjamin Lee and I am a professional musician, educator, and composer based out of District 2 but with students all over the city. I am calling to share some highlights from a letter of which I was a part in drafting.  between a group, a coalition of professional artists, arts administrators, arts nonprofits, community-based organizations, and arts supporters, all of whom together serve thousands of Oakland student families and community members across all the districts of this city. And I just wanted to share a couple highlights from this letter to uplift the leadership of the Defund Coalition, particularly APTP, who has really paved the way in allowing us to get the data that we need to present the case that we have.  At a moment when Oakland has been forced to reconcile its budget priorities in response to COVID and our standing deficit, we intend to argue that the city can wait no longer to address the unjust concentration of resources that has consistently protected the wealth and well-being of the few at the expense of the many. And we know that our arts and culture sector is just one of the many critical community services that have been negatively impacted by this misallocation of resources. It does not have to be this way.  We can reimagine public safety, reinvest in our community's health and well-being, and foster a sense of belonging for all peoples, while also refunding our arts and cultural sector all at the same time. We particularly wanted to call attention to the cultural funding program, an absolutely critical city function that has been systemically undervalued for the last 30 years. And I'll provide just one moment, one point of data to put this in perspective, if I can scroll down to it fast enough.  For what the city of Oakland pays in overtime alone to the top five highest paid Oakland police officers, we could instead fund 91 projects that support over 15,000 individual arts activities and connect over 1 million participants serving over 4,000 OUSD students.

My name is Laura Coelho and I'm here to make a comment about the resolution to support the Vision Act.  I am with the Center for Empowering Refugees and Immigrants, also known as SARE, an Oakland-based nonprofit with the mission to improve the social, emotional, psychological, economic, and physical health of refugees and immigrants who are affected by war, torture, genocide, or other forms of extreme trauma.  At Seri, I hear stories from our staff and community members about the traumatic impacts of racist policing, incarceration, and deportation. I was shocked when I first learned that someone who came here as a survivor of the Khmer Rouge genocide could be deported back to Cambodia, that a young refugee or immigrant who may have committed a crime in this country for the sake of their survival could be deported as an adult even after completing sentences in prison or jail.  Can you imagine getting deported to a country where you only knew suffering as a child and where you cannot feel belonging as an adult? At SARE, we see firsthand the devastation and stress that comes when families are separated or faced with the threat of separation. Our Southeast Asian community members who were formerly incarcerated or deported and their families are trying every day to heal and transform their lives in the face of oppressive systems.  Transferring Californians who have completed their sentences in prison or jail to ICE detention is cruel. We must pass the Vision Act to keep families and communities together.

I wanted to comment on what's happening now at Lake Merritt  I actually drove around Lake Merritt this Sunday on two different times. I drove around about 2 o'clock and then around 5 o'clock. Around 2 o'clock, it seems as though things were pretty organized and going well. But at 5 o'clock, it was an absolute disaster. You had people on the grand side who were double parked, people who were parking in the middle divider lane. You had motorcycles that were going across the grassy area where children were playing.  And the other thing is when you looked at the people who were down there, majority of them were not wearing masks at all. It was as if it was a big block party that was going on. The traffic was backed up down grand where you couldn't move. People were weaving in and out. It was an absolute disaster. I really support vendors in that they're trying to make a little money during this difficult time. So let me make a couple of suggestions as to how this might be corrected.  First of all, I think you do need to put the vendors in a concentrated area, which is the area right behind the library. You need to open up the Embarcadero, the short street that connects Lakeshore and Grand, allow the vendors to be in that area as well. I think you should not have vendors on either side, Lakeshore or Grand, but put them in that designated area. You need to ensure that all of the vendors have a permit.  I saw some people who were down there on Sunday. It looks as though they actually brought a little table out and started selling stuff and probably did not have a permit. So you need to have someone who is monitoring the vendors and ensure that they have a permit. I think you need to limit the food trucks that are over on Grand. It seems as though that that's an area where they tend to concentrate and socialize. And so limit the number of food trucks because that's where they actually come to socialize. The other thing is,  you need to shut it down at an appropriate time. I think five o'clock is a reasonable time when you look at other fairs that are going on, outdoor markets, shut it down at five o'clock.",Parks and Recreation

In 2017, my father, Hugo Aguilar, was transferred from jail to ICE custody. At the time, I was only around 11 years old, so I didn't really understand what was going on. Only until recently, I began to understand the reason my dad was away from us was for one year and five months was because of these ICE transfers.  To this day, my dad, he is still at face of deportation. He has a date for May 5th to be deported back to Mexico. And I think that it's important that you guys recognize that these transfers don't only affect the detainees, but also the families and the children. My father has two other children as well. My brother is five, six years old and my sister is three years old and they had to grow up the beginning of their lives without a dad and it might happen again.  And it just comes to show that everyone is impacted by these transfers and the trauma that we went through in that time isn't going to go away. And if you could do anything to stop causing trauma upon other children, I just ask and beg of you because it is not fair that instead of worrying about our homework and worrying about things that kids should be worrying about, we have to worry about our parents not being here with us.

My congregation of over 500 families very strongly supports the Vision Act. We believe as part of our faith that we are all equally sacred and that families should never be separated. We've seen over and over again that people can change their lives. Any person who's gone through the rigorous process of proving that they are ready to be paroled back to their community should be freed.  ICE has no basis to claim that someone is a danger to the community when the criminal justice system has already determined that they are not. It is wrong for California to hand someone over to ICE who should be going home to their family and community. This collaboration with ICE is even more wrong and cruel during the time of COVID because it puts people who have no need to be incarcerated at unnecessary risk for infection and death.  During the past year, Kahila has provided temporary shelter for several individuals to quarantine after being released from prison or ICE detention. I mentioned this because it is an example of an alternative to ICE detention, which enables people who are fighting their immigration cases to return home to their families and supportive communities after incarceration. Many, many families and communities are ready and willing to provide such alternatives.  Thank you to Council Member Best for championing the resolution in support of the Vision Act.

Hi, yes, this is Jack Fleck. Thank you very much to Dan Kalb. I want to call into support item 2.17, which calls for the city to urge the state to phase out the sale of gas cars by 2030.  As you know, there's an executive order to phase this out by 2035. But the urgency of the climate crisis is really extreme. Everybody in Oakland is at risk. Right now, this summer, we're heading into a drought season. This is the fifth year in a row where we're going to be facing the risk of wildfires. And remember, in 1991, that fire, if the wind hadn't changed, the whole city could have burned down. And that's what we're facing with climate change, because now it's hotter and it's drier than it was in 1991.  So I'd like to call your attention to certainly support this resolution, but also I'd call your attention to this recent report by Dan Kamen and a number of scientists and climate experts that talks about how we are already on track to hit 1.5 degrees global warming by 2030. And that means that we really have to eliminate greenhouse gases by 2030, not just cut it by 40% as the state goal is.  not just cut it by 50% as the IPCC talks about, but go for 100%. So I want to urge you to double and redouble the Ecuador Climate Action Plan goals to support the city's electric vehicle roadmap and remind you that these electric vehicles can provide literally hundreds and hundreds of good paying electrician jobs as we retrofit all the houses to make sure they have electric vehicle chargers.

I've heard a lot recently about encampments being safer for unhoused folks rather than shelters, and I disagree. SVDP has had a far better track record of safety in our shelter than in the surrounding encampments. Since the pandemic began, we've seen 20,000 socially distanced bed nights in our shelter, served over 20,000, 200,000 meals,  Vaccinated 150 people and given almost 1,000 COVID tests. In that time, we've had no violent incidents and only one positive COVID test result out of 1,000 tests. By contrast, in the last eight months in the encampment at the end of our block, a woman was wounded in a drive-by shooting, a man was fatally shot, another man was fatally stabbed, a man was shot multiple times but survived, and a woman was beaten to death.  I don't know the exact number of overdoses, rapes, and tent fires that have occurred in that time, but there have been dozens.

Shelter Oak advocates policy action and solutions to homelessness. Item six requests authority, one, to amend existing agreements for homeless intervention services, and two, to authorize entering into new agreements, both stipulate without returning to council. Minor adjustments in existing contracts should be within the authority of the administrator. Maybe I'm old-fashioned, but to me, a million dollars is not minor.  Contract extensions, major modifications, or substantial allocations should require the review and action of the City Council.  Additionally, some of the services are to be funded by Measure Q. The 30% of funds generated by Measure Q for homeless needs require review, recommendation and oversight of the Homelessness Commission. This funding should reflect their deliberation. We urge that item six be removed from the council's agenda and referred to the Homelessness Commission as legally mandated.  Why are these items removed from the normal budget process? Homeless designated funds from the CARES Act and the 2021 America Recovery Plan are intended for innovative programs to alleviate homelessness.

Our sheriff's department has even more power. So we're happy that you're bringing up a resolution to support SB 271.

This resolution is very important to our AAPI and immigrant and refugee community. For our AAPI community, we know that violence has been happening to our community. Deportation and ICE transfer is another form of this hate and violence.  For Southeast Asian, many of us settled here in the U.S. due to war and violence in their homeland.  And many of the South East Asian youth grew up suffering violence by being bullied, teased, and beat up. So they joined subgroup for protection. And just like our Black, Brown, and disenfranchised communities, they ended up suffering state violence through incarceration. But for them, it doesn't stop there. Because after serving their time, transforming their lives around, they then suffered the violence of being transferred over the ice, a double punishment, which is really inhumane.  and being threatened or deported to a country that their parents fled war from, a country they had never set foot on. So my question is, when will this violence end for us? So in closing, to support and end violence against our AAPI community, I urge the Oakland City Council members and our mayors to support this resolution in support of AB 937 Division Act.

Instead, they are facing indefinite mental and physical harm funneled to ICE attention.

My name is Charles Joseph. I'm the spiritual activist in residence with the Interfaith Movement for Human Integrity based in Oakland, Chinatown in D2.  Interfaith Movement for Human Integrity is a statewide organization of 250 congregations and over 1,000 faith leaders who are committed to supporting immigrants in our state impacted by immigration detention and mass incarceration. Last year, we submitted a letter to Governor Newsom urging him to stop ICE transfers  signed on by 600 faith leaders and organizations across the state. I personally experienced being transferred from CDCR to ICE. I was released on parole from CDCR, but my parole was never honored. I experienced the mental strain of being in limbo and not knowing if I would ever see my family again. I was housed in Mesa Verde in a 100-man dorm under horrible conditions that were only magnified because of COVID virus.  Even after the verbal and written communications with staff and ICE, we still didn't have the ability to practice safe and proper hand washing with only five bars of soap between 100 men. They say we are a threat to our communities, but our communities continue to fight for our liberation. They say we are a flight risk, but we are fighting to remain with our families. We did a demonstration in the yard and led  led to a four-day hunger strike where we raised all the issues that we face from cleaning supplies, food quality, living conditions, and injustice we face being detained and ineffective medical care and mental health care. I was released from ICE after 11 months and count myself fortunate. Some of my brothers and sisters spent years in ICE for a civil matter and continue to suffer.

On behalf of the Coalition for Police Accountability and the Latino Task Force, I am urging you to approve the Reimagining Public Safety report. We understand that as we seek to eliminate the inequities of public safety and redirect 50% of the police budget, our struggle against police crimes and the pursuit of police accountability  needs to recognize that racism is first and foremost imposed by white racist political power and its political institutions. Witness the murder of Mario Gonzalez in the city of Alameda. Not too long ago, this city council was made up of all white men. After community and coalition efforts, we began to see Asian, Black, Latino, and women representation.  Today's council has majority women and majority people of color rightfully representing our diverse city. It is a new day. In the summer of 2020, you mandated that a task force be set in motion. Thanks to Councilman Gallo, I was honored to represent District 5 and assist in approving and prioritizing the recommendations before you today.  Many CPA members also participated in advisory boards and working groups. Reimagining public safety caused many of us to question what it means to have a police force that many times brings more harm than protection. At our weekly meetings, we also learned  of the ongoing murders in our neighborhoods. These realities made our tasks more urgent and crucially necessary. We in Latino Task Force and CPA are in alignment with the task force report, but would strongly urge you to move recommendation number 69 slash 107 from phase two to phase one. This recommendation received 10 priority votes from the task force. RJ diversion has proven to be effective and preventive.  NOAB and the community works ensures that youth take responsibilities for the harm they have committed and provide them with critical services and not reoffend.

Mario Gonzalez was killed one day before the Derek Chauvin verdict was announced. Chauvin is only the seventh police officer ever convicted of murder, even though police kill over 1,000 people per year in the US.  An Alameda resident called the police on Mario, not because he was doing anything wrong, but simply because they were afraid. There is plenty of work to be done to address white people weaponizing their fear and calling police on black and brown people for simply existing. While we may not fix that overnight, we can remove police from the equation now. We must remove police from these situations where there's absolutely no reason for them to be there.  I can imagine a world where Mario is alive today. Local organizers have already done the work figuring out how to support community and keep people safe. All we need to do is get the money away from police and into these other resources. Police have never and will never keep people safe. We've tried this experiment and the evidence is clear. It does not work.  I urge City Council to continue the work of defunding OPD. As Cat Brooks says, they have the money now, and what results are we seeing? The only solution is to defund OPD and reinvest in our communities. Please adopt and implement the Defund Coalition's priority recommendations, which include number 58, funding and creating community hotlines and transferring 911 calls out of OPD.  Permanent funding for macro, reinvesting in mobile street outreach for our houseless community, capping OPD overtime, move traffic reinforcement out of OPD, decriminalize sex work and homelessness, and expand restorative and transformative justice programs.

Additionally, I would urge the city council to also prioritize recommendation 74, which requests an annual funding allocation of $2.5 million to be invested in gender-based violence prevention programming, such as peer-to-peer education programs and programs for vulnerable youth.

I support the recommendations prioritized by the Defund Coalition, and I specifically wanted to highlight the following recommendations as critical to reallocating OPD budget and increasing public safety. Number 59, move traffic enforcement out of OPD. Number 57, invest in macro. This requires both fully funding the initial implementation so Chief Drayton has the budget and resources to make it as successful as possible  and budgeting for an expedited macro expansion for full city-wide rollout. And the last item I wanted to mention is worth discussing in tandem to agenda item number three, number 53, update the alarm code to require a verified alarm response. The amount of time that officers spend responding to false alarms cost way more than what is covered by the fines for false alarms.  Requiring verified response will further reduce the amount of OPD resources and budget spent on false alarms.

And I'd also like to urge the council to begin thinking about rewriting Measure Z and getting that to the voters sooner rather than later, because that is something that could, if rewritten correctly, could fund a lot of the services that the task force has identified in the recommendations. And I urge the council to begin that process sooner rather than later. Thank you for your time.",Police Reform

And so my parents and myself do not feel safe with more police on campus. We need our youth, especially our youth of color, to be safe from being harassed by police and from outside factors.

I support the Anti-Police Terror Project and Defund Police Coalition's priority recommendations. These smart, common sense recommendations provide a roadmap for transforming public safety in Oakland by investing in alternatives to law enforcement for mental health crises and other emergencies and moving 911 calls out of OPD number 57 and 58.  Adequately funding gender-based violence prevention, response, and survivor support services, number 72, 73, and 74.

This is Gabriel Garcia and I am the policy and advocacy manager for Youth Alive. On April 28th, we submitted a letter detailing some of our recommendations coming out of the Reimagining Public Safety Task Force. As a member of one of the advisory boards for the task force, I conducted some listening sessions with our youth staff and clients who have experienced violent crime directly and personally.  And through those conversations, we developed these policy priorities for reimagining public safety. This conversation has only become more important as we are seeing historic levels of violence in Oakland right now. Reimagining public safety has become  and even stronger imperative for us as a city. What we are detailing is really calling on the city council to invest heavily in community-based violence prevention and intervention services. The overwhelming body of research shows that these kinds of programs managed by the Department of Violence Prevention  are extremely effective at preventing and responding to violence. And it's time that we immediately double the DVP budget so that these programs are able to actually be resourced to meet the need that we are seeing in the community right now. In addition to that, through our listening sessions, we saw that investing in culturally appropriate mental health services  is incredibly important. It's a priority for our clients and it's a priority for our young folks. So making sure that any conversations around re-imagining mental health can actually be informed by the people that would be served by these new programs is incredibly key for us. Lastly, making sure that the OPD budget focuses directly on shootings and homicides and not on nonviolent or non-criminal issues.  We've detailed these requests in our letter, but we are available to answer any questions you might have. Thank you so much.",Police Reform

In the 2011-2013 budget, the City Council voted to consolidate the intake of complaints of police misconduct at the CPRB, non-internal affairs. That never happened. As a result, the City has continued to duplicate the process of intaking and investigating these complaints  from the public. This is wasteful and makes poor use of highly trained and highly paid police officers whose skills would be better utilized investigating crimes instead of complaints against fellow officers.

Isabel Lucero here with Oakland Frontline Killers, patient advocate and chaplain student. You know, the public sector can reduce crime with a stroke of a pen by creating environments with reduced risk for crime and victimization. There are three key elements that keep us there, and that's low parental education, poverty and homelessness.  So how can we make these changes? This is by, you know, reopening parks and recreation centers, providing tutoring, whether that be in math and budgeting and banking, providing coding for our kids, a library at these parks and recs, a book club, chess at the Berkeley Chess Club, learning Spanish and Mandarin, which will unite us.  Kumon, maybe a private owner who comes in and provides Kumon. Math is imperative. Or perhaps one of the nonprofits under OFH, there are 29 nonprofits, purchases that franchise so that Kumon can be on site. It's empowering. For me, as a single mother of three children, I know that $5 is a whole chicken. That's 30 enchiladas and a pot of soup. When you teach a kid how to budget that way, you know how to succeed. So these are in parents. I would like to see an on-site mental health therapist at these parks and recreation.  Let's extend some hours. Let's have a coffee shop there, roller skating for our children, tennis. We can provide housing and perhaps even job sites for them. Let's employ them people. Let's make sure that the nonprofits are leading these programs. And why? Why should we do this? Well, we know the studies tell us that early childhood education centers closes the gaps.  Number two, joblessness, Black and Latino communities. It's rooted in structural inequities, job opportunities, jobs, jobs, jobs. So let's reprioritize 144, 149, 67, 68, 69, and 107.

My name is Stephanie Dominguez Walton and I'm speaking on behalf of the Latino Task Force. We've identified the following priorities from among the final list of recommendations presented to you today. Items number 31 and 84, transfer most of internal affairs division to community police review agency.  It's time to move all publicly generated complaints from IAD to CIPRA where the investigations are done by civilians who work under the direction of an independent civilian oversight body, the Police Commission. Number 59, transfer most traffic duties from OPD to Oakland Department of Transportation. Nationally since 2015, 25% of the killings of unarmed African-Americans by police have been due to traffic stops. We can impact that number here in Oakland by moving traffic enforcement personnel and responsibilities out of Oakland Police Department  and into Oakland DOT. Allowing unarmed civil servants to enforce traffic laws, focus on high injury corridors rather than high crime neighborhoods as OPD currently does. Number 57, long-term investment in macro. We desperately need an alternative response to armed police officers for low level and non-violent calls. The mobile assistance community responders of Oakland program needs to be implemented citywide. Number 69 and 107, expand restorative diversion for youth and young adults.  Imagine if every young person who made a thoughtless mistake had an opportunity to start over with the assistance and support of their community. We believe every young person deserves a second chance. As someone with over 20 years of sobriety, I wouldn't be speaking to you today if a second chance hadn't been offered me. A young person who goes through a restorative justice diversion program is 50% less likely to repeat than a young person who goes through the criminal legal system.

I really appreciate that this recommendation recommends funding macro so it can expand to serve more neighborhoods quickly and reduce police interactions with Oaklanders as quickly as possible. I'd ask that you consider as the council that fully funding macro is important in ensuring that it responds to a broad range of low-level situations as it was designed.  and not the smaller restricted sets of calls that some people discuss in the alternative. I'd ask that the macro budget be placed within the public safety budget. They're doing public safety work, responding to situations that would otherwise be responded to by police or fire. And I wanted to thank everybody who has ensured that the macro jobs are protected and stable and good jobs with union representation.  But we also want to make sure that there's excellent wage rates that let macro responders thrive in Oakland and that work does not lose its value when it's performed by Black and Brown Oaklanders serving their own community.

When people didn't don't want to call OPD, they called APTP about everything from trying to peacefully end romantic relationships to mental health crisis to you name it. So we stopped waiting for Oakland to build what we demanded six years ago and built our own, MH First.

On behalf of Coalition for Police Accountability, I speak specifically in support of the recommendation number 89, cap police overtime.  The city spent more than $35 million on police overtime in 2020, enabling over 100 officers to more than double their base salaries and putting total police personnel costs well above $250 million. It's time to cap police overtime for reasons of both costs and public safety.  Oakland Police Department exceeded its budget by $32 million over the last fiscal year, including more than $19 million in overtime that was not budgeted. This cannot continue. The coalition is also in support, among many others, of recommendations 49, 54, and 55 for data transparency, and these should be moved from Phase 2 to Phase 1.  The Oakland Police Department's operational data is critical to making decisions about alternative allocations. Data transparency for the public needs to be enacted immediately, not put off to phase two of the task force. Recommendations as it presently is.

My name is Ioana Trucleva and I'm a resident of District 3 and one of the many authors of the Restorative and Transformative Justice Recommendations number 67, 68, 69, 70, 58, and 144.  These recs were written with input from dozens of community members and youth restorative justice leaders, and were supported by hundreds of folks through an online petition that we barely even distributed. Why? Because we know in the data shows that restorative and transformative justice practices work to both prevent harm and address harm in a way that helps people heal, in a way that helps all of us heal. It is time that we build our citywide restorative and transformative justice web of support that centers and embraces our most vulnerable community members.  It is time that we expand diversion, fund re-entry, invest in community-led crisis hotlines, train and pay community outreach workers and violence interrupters. And it is over time that we listen to and uplift the voices of our youth, as Recommendation 122 says. We ask that you adopt the resolution before you and begin implementing it faithfully with continuous community input and with consultation with the Chichen Ilani people on whose land we sit. Thank you so very much.",Police Reform

I'm not going to reiterate all of the talking points in that letter, but I support the letter in full. And I just want to say as a service provider that's doing this work and along with all the other service providers that, you know, signed on to this, I think I speak for most of us when I say that gender-based violence funding is extremely low for what we're doing. We're all very, very, very at capacity. We, you know, we see this work on a large scale and we see the demand firsthand.  not just for legal services, but for families, supporting families, supporting housing, supporting stability, supporting independence and financial freedom and power and basic survival, honestly. Certainly these families aren't alone. This is just tip of the iceberg as far as, you know, people that are struggling right now in the pandemic. But, you know, I just want to keep reinforcing that the funding is,  It's crucial for future generations. It's crucial for families, for people to have basic services met. When you fund gender-based violence services, it's critical to the communities that you're serving. And I just want to make sure that we keep reiterating how important it is to centralize it in our anti-violence efforts in Oakland, which are extremely, extremely important right now.  So I just want to thank, again, the people that were involved in creating this, all the service providers that signed on and worked on this, and the city council members that are listening and that are hopefully adopting these efforts and to continue supporting.",Public Safety and Law Enforcement

I live in District 5, and I'm a social justice minister in the East Bay and a faith-rooted organizer with East Bay Alliance for a Sustainable Economy. My voice represents 140 faith communities and 28 faith institutions who have committed to signing on the Faith Moral Budget Letter to Mayor Libby Schaaf, demanding a budget which calls for bold policies to changing harmful structures impacting vulnerable communities.  Now more than ever, we know that racism is real. As it can come through as bad policy decisions, it makes for a more harsher society, a more punitive one, a more harsher one. To that end, city council needs to incorporate specific recommendations that APTP and the Defund Police Coalition have crafted over the past six months to reimagine public safety here in Oakland. A budget is a moral document and a reflection of our values.  Today, we are asking you to refund and reinvest in a stronger and safer Oakland. Let's begin to end the legacy of state-sanctioned violence. Make Oakland safer for everybody. The safest communities don't have the most costs. They have the most resources. And on a personal note, I'm disappointed that the mayor has failed to publish her proposed budget by the legal deadline of May 1st.

I'm calling to demand that City Council listen to the leadership of the people of Oakland, whom it is your job to represent, and immediately put in action the recommendations of the Reimagining Public Safety Task Force. When you hear us asking for you to defund OPD by 50%, we are not asking for OPD to continue to operate at its current capacity but on a smaller budget, although that is what is asked of our city's teachers every single day.  What we are asking is for public safety to be completely transformed, for the emphasis to shift from one of punishment to one of investment in human life. Instead of police acting as the point of contact for all of our social challenges, we need investment in our communities so that the root of the problems we face can be solved. There would simply be less crime to respond to if our communities had the resources they need. Police will point to the violence in parts of Oakland as justification for them to continue exactly what they're doing, when in reality the violence we see is proof that the current system does not work.  OPD has had nearly two centuries to figure out a way to make us safer. The violence we see today is not proof that we still need them. It is proof that they have failed. It is time to stop throwing money at this failed system and instead, for once, try something new. The plan put forward by the Reimagining Public Safety Task Force is detailed, well thought out, and overwhelmingly popular across Oakland. It is the result of decades of activism and careful research, and to continue to delay serious action on this issue would be to betray your duties as public servants.  Please turn the task force's recommendations into reality. That is something that is within your power right now with the current budget. It is what your constituents are telling you we need, and it is your job to listen to us and to take action on our behalf. Thank you.",Police Reform

As a Lakeside resident in particular, I wholeheartedly reject and condemn the police cruisers and officers that are being used  as threats, essentially, to chase Black Oaklanders out of Lake Merritt, which is a public park. The coalition provides many more recommendations as to what we could do with the money currently gobbled up by OPD, offering a comprehensive roadmap for transforming public safety in Oakland.

Lastly, I want to commend the young people who have spoken today and who are organizing all over the city.

In spite of the devastating harm caused by gender-based violence in our city, Oakland has failed for decades to allocate the resources needed to address it. It's a life-threatening problem impacting 75,000 Oaklanders.  And the city only allocates 0.1% of its overall budget for non-law enforcement based services like the ones offered by my organization and many others. We recommend that the city council either allocate the full 20 million according to recommendation 149 to the Department of Violence Prevention,  to fully fund or at least provide initial more robust funding to that department so that it can carry out its important work, which includes gender-based violence work. Alternatively, we would support passage of recommendations 72 and 73  as an interim step to double the money available for gender-based violence services and also allocate funds directly to survivors who have been greatly impacted by the pandemic. In addition, we support recommendation 74 so that the city finally begins investing in prevention efforts so that we can stop  the epidemic of gender-based violence.

Like many of you on this call, I watched the state-sanctioned murder of Mario Gonzalez by the hands of Alameda PD. And we have to be clear that this man was murdered.  There was no reason for anyone to call the police to be involved in what happened that day. But beyond anything else, we need to have resources for our community. We need to have mental health services for our folks in the street. We need to be putting money into these programs that support and uplift our community as opposed to beating us down and killing us. As many folks have mentioned,  The measures that have been recommended are overwhelmingly popular across our community. Our people have spoken. We, the people, we have spoken. I want to add my dismay at seeing Oakland Police Department's over budgeting during the 2019-2020 fiscal year that OPD was over budget by $18.6 million while  community resources, housing and community development, human services, parks and recreation, the Department of Violence Prevention were significantly under budget. I'm an educator and a healthcare worker, and I've seen far too often what a lack of housing, what a lack of adequate healthcare, what a lack of resources to mental health does to our community. We have said it time and time again,  Having more police on the street does not make us safe. We need resources. We need systemic change. We need to be transformational in this change.

At a moment when Oakland's being forced to reconcile its budget priorities in response to COVID and our standing deficit, we argue that the city can no longer wait to address the unjust concentration of resources that has consistently protected the wealth and well-being of the few at the expense of the many.

While I was listening to your meeting today, I sent a letter to you and other city officials regarding some of the same issues we've been discussing, including race equity and disparity.  While you may have not had a chance to read it yet, I hope you give my letter due attention as time-sensitive. It pertains to a Planning Commission meeting this Wednesday, May 5th at 3 p.m. At this meeting, the property developer, Hines, from Houston, Texas, is asking for an entitlement to build the largest tower in Oakland, nearly 1 million feet of office space. The 494-page report for this project was quietly released sometime late last week, less than one week before the project is set for approval.  This proposal is deficient from the start. From the very first line of the document, the project states its address is 415 20th Street. This is not a legal address. The legal address for this project is 415 Thomas L. Berkeley Way. Thomas L. Berkeley was a pioneering African-American publisher, attorney, civic leader, and civil rights advocate who never allowed anyone to make him a second-class citizen. Councilmember Reid,  This legislation was sponsored by your father and passed in 2002. I included the legislation in my document. This developer is attempting to erase Oakland's black history. Rather than honoring the legacy of one of the black men who helped build this city, they are attempting to erase his name off the map. This is not legal and can be very well perceived as racist. I sent this letter to the planning commission and would like you to reach out to them.  I would ask that this project is continued from their May 5th meeting and return to another commission meeting and be listed by its legal address, 415 Thomas L. Berkeley Way. This project should not be rubber stamped until it is thoroughly vetted. The discrepancy of the address at the top of the report is indicative of a number of issues which have not been properly addressed, including issues that will affect the health and safety of the residents of my building who live within 300 feet of this project.",Urban Development

Let me start off by saying, in order to look at policing and how it impacts the various communities based on race and ethnicity,  You have to have the evidence that demonstrates how negatively the police department is impacting those communities.

I have not seen documents that reflect the same thing related to other ethnic groups.  how disparate treatment goes on in the Asian American community, the Latino, Hispanic community, the Asian Pacific community. That data has to be produced. It is unfair to the African American community to say that every ethnic group and race is having the same experience as black people. Therefore, we put in place programs to deal with that. Secondly,  Looking at Lake Merritt this weekend, I was told that the reason why they had no parking on the streets of Grand is because people were parking and selling cocaine and alcohol.

And did this lapdog come up with what he came up with? And that's why this extended discussion. He was trying to undermine what was a clear project going forward. That's so disingenuous.  And let me give you President Bass on closed session, which you still have yet to tell us what the council did back on November 4th and 5th in 2019 as it relates to the summary judgment. After each closed session, the legislative body must report in open session certain actions taken in closed session. So when are we going to hear that?

David Castillo, Oakland resident, former principal educator, District 7 resident. I just I wanted to offer some high level comments, really not getting into the weeds of what you talked about today because it was a lot for this type of meeting.  But as a general observer and somebody who's aware of the general parameters of the Brown Act, it feels like some of these items, resolutions, whatever they might be, whatever content is, whether I agree or not,  It feels like bringing items forward to these bodies during the regular workday when people should be working or children should be in school and then manipulating them via the friendly amendment process is a smack in the face to democracy and the principles of why you were all elected. It feels like it's an open door to special interests that can come in and campaign and knock on your doors and  influence you regardless of what it is. So I would just offer to you all  you know, some general advice to say, like, do much more of this vetting beforehand. And when you, when you bring these items forward and if they come out, you know, and if it looks a lot different than what it looked like when it came in, bring it back for full public debate and full public discussion, because otherwise it looks like you're catering to special interests, regardless of the matter.

With respect to the chair and Vice Mayor Kaplan, with your resolution you're bringing forth with regard to equity pay, let me say, I won't even say their name out of respect, but one of your current staff members in City Hall,  Had a stroke last evening because some things that related to their pay. If you want to know who that person is, you could call me offline out of respect to them. I'm not going to say anything. But I will say you need to take care of Markeisha Smith, okay, for over a year. And we know she was underpaid when you hired –  the administrator, Ed Riskin, as the Assistant City Administrator. Take care of her. It's hypocritical for you to talk about equity pay, Vice Mayor, and you don't bring this forth at closed session. Also, let's take care of our Assistant City Manager,  who's doing double duty. Give her $2 million out of human services. Don't have her waiting until the CARES Act. She needs that now if you expect her to do the work that she's doing. And the counsel, Bass, stop being hypocritical. You put information into a resolution that you know is not true.

And we always want to join in recognition of the clerks who work so hard, especially given the circumstances of COVID, the way meetings had to change. I'm speaking on the rent control issue. I beg your pardon, I don't know the exact item number, but this is something that is long overdue to make sure that units are not held off to the market or  to make sure that unscrupulous people rent out units at prices higher than they pay so that unwitting subtenants get defrauded. I'm pleased that it was passed unanimously by the rent board and by the CED committee. We understand that you guys agreed to delay  implementation for 90 days after the COVID emergency was passed. I don't really know that that's necessary, but I'm not gonna fight it. I'm not gonna argue against it.

I'm hoping to get a direct answer from the council today on the following question.  Are you all aware that the code enforcement department is currently evicting people living in tiny homes across the city on private property? There is a way to stop this using the language of an existing ordinance you have already passed twice.  Six years ago, my friends and I created an RV park as a way to house ourselves affordably. We've since formed a nonprofit, are part of the California RV Park Association, and have been working on perfecting the model of living light on the land and light on our pocketbooks in community.  We've served as a space of affordable housing for nearly 30 people in our history, including most recently because of COVID, my 62-year-old mother, who, if not for our space, may not be around today. Last fall, code enforcement discovered our existence and gave us one month's notice  to move out or face escalating fines. We're now at $5,000 worth of fines, a property lien, and a ton of headaches. This is happening across the city. And at the same time, I hear you all speak with conviction, rightly, about the urgent need for RV parks and tiny home solutions. This is a solution that's happening right now, and it's being shut down not for safety, not for being a nuisance, but purely for being small,  and on wheels and not part of the outdated codes. There's a very elegant way to stop this set of evictions and unnecessary suffering. And it requires three simple ingredients. You pass the exact same shelter crisis ordinance that was passed in 2017. And then again in 2019, and you just add two words, private property. Doing that will halt code enforcement for non-safety issues like living in a trailer for more than 72 hours on private property. And it will buy time to rewrite the codes for the 21st century. Thank you.",Housing

Good afternoon, President Pro Tem Tao, Vice Mayor Kaplan, members of the Oakland City Council. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak today. My name is Daniel Gregg. I'm the lead field representative at Carpenters Local 713. I represent approximately 40,000 carpenters in Northern California, 5,000 in Alameda County, and around 2,000 here in the city of Oakland. The Carpenters Union has a long history of supporting housing.  Our members supported the county's highly successful A1 initiative, which has brought hundreds of units of affordable housing to the county, not only in spirit, but resident carpenters canvassed door-to-door in support of the bond. We also support innovation and alternate methods to bring more housing online. Factory S employs over 500 workers who are represented by the Carpenters Union.  earning a living wage and benefits and have partnered with several developers in the Bay Area. One of the first projects manufactured at Factory S is the Phoenix, a West Oakland supportive housing project intended to alleviate conditions for at-risk populations. We know that Oakland has become increasingly unaffordable in recent years, both to newcomers and longtime residents.  During the same period, the number of individuals experiencing homelessness has also increased. A city-led initiative to identify underutilized parcels, city or otherwise, for homeless housing is something the Carpenters Union as an organization would like to work collaboratively with the city of Oakland to accomplish. It is a win-win situation with policies such as the one before us today include provisions that create good paying jobs. We all know that a good paying job is a buffer to the possibility for an individual or a family to possibly experience homelessness.  In that vein, the Carpenters Union has some recommendations we would appreciate the city explore as this initiative moves forward. One, labor standards for necessary site work on the supply innovation side, the rapid build modular.  you know, the Oakland living wage ordinance to carry over into the manufacturing of the modules, a smaller carbon footprint when it comes to trucking the modules into the city of Oakland, which leads to localization of the manufacturing and to make sure that the workers building the modules have healthcare and training and are paid a living.",Housing

You're acting like that's a non-issue.  Gallo needs to stop talking about people coming from outside of Oakland. This is a sanctuary city. A lot of the people in your district come here from different countries as undocumented, and we welcome them with open arms. So why is it a problem that people come from different cities into Oakland? That's a problem? Stop it, Gallo. And Taylor, get that $100,000 back from Gallo. The United Council doesn't need the money. We need the money in District 6.  Get that money back. Human services has got to get somebody to take over and do right by people because they have messed up tremendously, the money.

It's a work in progress, and I'll go over a couple of the key things, but we have not had time to do it, so we will be getting back with some more questions and clarification requests. Under one in the Q and R responses,  We asked for where the $4 million of new revenue is coming from, and the answer was that there's going to be a COLA, and it's going to be on your June 1st agenda. That we were unaware of. There has not been one operational staff person hired as of now, and the first hiring will be done probably in June or maybe July.  And so for the six months of this measure that was supposed to have new people hired, there haven't been. So we haven't seen any service deliverable increases. So it's in question whether a COLA is really advisable for this first year of Measure Q. And we'd like to know where the other $3 million of the revenue increase are since the finance department told us the COLA would result in $998,000. That's not mentioned in this supplemental.  But that is what they told us. A few other things. The $2.250 million that the council will have discretion over, we would like a much more comprehensive list of projects in the parks, including the DG pathways at Lake Merritt, which are in very poor condition, and also to make sure that they're equitably spread out throughout the state.  We have many other issues. I'd like to know what the fund balance in Measure Q is. That is not defined anywhere and that's different than the carry forwards.",Governance and Civic Engagement

That would be the equivalent of 3 million in today's dollars. And instead, you know, the cultural affairs division is facing possible cuts and it's funding grants funding has been baselined at about 1.4 million. So we've actually divested from the arts in Oakland.  And we want to see an increase in the amount of funds that go directly into the hands of Oakland's working artists and cultural organizations, which are the soul of the city. I wanted to thank council members Bass, Fife, and Kaplan for including the arts in your budget priorities.  And I want to also thank members for their support of the Reimagining Public Safety Commission. We believe that the arts are key to this concept of a safe, connected community. And just wanted to also acknowledge that for what Oakland spent in 2019 on the top five  police officers receiving overtime. That's the equivalent of 1.2 million, which is around the current budget of the granting. And so what's spent on five police officers could instead go to funding over 90 artists, 15,000 arts activities and programming for 4,000 students. So thank you for prioritizing the arts.",Arts and Culture

I am the chair of the Glenview Neighborhood Association, but I appear here today to represent myself and my family as a Park Boulevard resident in D5. I am asking you and the city council today to address rampant speeding and unsafe driving on Park Boulevard and throughout the city in this budget. Residents of Park Boulevard have been asking the city to address the unsafe driving on Park for 20 years with no major improvements.  Over the course of the pandemic, reckless driving has reached extraordinary levels, even as there are more pedestrians on the street. Then on Mother's Day, a 40 year old father standing on the sidewalk was killed in broad daylight by a speeding car.  As I have advocated for a safer Park Boulevard, I keep hearing that speeding and reckless driving is a problem across the city. The city has a Department of Transportation with a vision of zero traffic fatalities. That department knows that implementing smarter traffic and street design along not only park but streets across the city will protect pedestrians without requiring additional police presence and traffic enforcement.  The budget should prioritize capital improvements to city streets, including park, that will move Oakland closer to its vision zero without additional police enforcement. While this is a major investment now, it will pay out long after the project is finished.  Projects are finished. Changes to Park Boulevard are on the budget's unfunded capital improvements list. The city is liable for each and every incident on Park. I ask that after 20 years of requests, the city prioritize Park Boulevard improvements before there is another tragedy. Further, I ask that the city prioritize protecting pedestrians across the city by investing in safe streets. Thank you.",Transportation and Mobility

It just makes me stronger. I want to talk quickly about a type of budget. And that's a budget that is a GoFundMe.  And these dollars go into GoFundMe, which should be interesting to get into the hands of black men in Oakland. I recently have initiated a GoFundMe, but I am now going to cancel my GoFundMe. And all the money in my GoFundMe, I would like to see it go to Catholic charities, because I recently saw a member of Hogg at UWB raise a GoFundMe asking for $30,000 for porta potties, which the city should be providing.  I don't want a penny from anybody. I'll make my own way and buy my own van. I will be here in the all-tall finish courts until I successfully do that. This GoFundMe is getting to be an issue. Money is going to the wrong people. The Village is not a GoFundMe resource that's going to be honest and get funds to the right people.  I hate to have to be coming at another advocacy group like this, but it's fine. They are killing us and Paul Mooney, our kind of politics, fighting for black people. I don't want money.

It's just been such a pleasure to listen to everyone's comments. And I also support the Refund Coalition. And, you know, we've been at this for years, asking, you know, very nicely, every budget cycle,  to just invest back in the community. Obviously, if we create more jobs for Oaklanders, they're going to spend their money here first, and it's just going to be taxed. Renters pay property tax. It's included in our rent. We pay most of the property tax as renters, actually, because we actually make up most of Oakland, and there would be a lot more of us if we got us off the streets and into housing that could become permanent, that could become affordable, that could go up in price slowly.  That could be cooperative and public and owned by the city of Oakland. And how's it going with our public bank? I mean, we're all saying the same thing. And I've been actually gone personally away from Oakland because I'm trying to become a foster parent in Petaluma where they're really trying to stop things where they start. You know, when kids are teenagers and they start to become violent and approaching it with unconditional love. And it's the same thing that Oakland needs. It needs your unconditional love.  And for people who want the tunnel in District 1, in richer neighborhoods, in white neighborhoods, in wealthier neighborhoods, I don't feel like you're understanding your white privilege in Oakland and how Black people have suffered in this city needlessly when the money is collected, and it's all our money, and it's a billion-dollar budget, and we fund an institution that terrorizes them and kills them.  When you go to the police department, the number of policemen who have been killed in the history of the police department, there should be on the opposite wall everyone they shot and killed as a reminder. Because we all have to heal from this together. And this budget is a reflection of how we can heal this racist system. It's our budget. It's our money.

We can't keep going and letting them overspend with no consequences. So you need to be discussing that. You need to have  solutions now. We can't keep allowing them to spend that money over and over. We also need to be looking at what things need to be decriminalized now. We can stop them from engaging people by changing what our laws are. So what will you be doing?  to decriminalize drug use?

MACRO was developed with extensive participation by Oaklanders and now enjoys massive support across all neighborhoods. For MACRO to succeed, it must have well-paid union jobs so that turnover is low and this important work is valued. The urban strategies report on the MACRO model developed by Oaklanders recommends a salary of $70,000 annually for the responders.  This work is currently being done by very well-paid police officers, the majority of whom do not live in Oakland. The work does not lose value when it is being done by well-trained black and brown Oaklanders living in the neighborhoods that they serve. It's our understanding that the city administration is currently looking at a starting salary of $22 an hour. People cannot live in Oakland for $22 an hour. And it would, in fact,  help to guarantee that the macro doesn't succeed. The mayor's budget woefully underfunds macro.

My name is Christine Windham. I'm a resident of Glenview District 5, and I work with our local group Neighbors for Racial Justice. I am extremely disappointed with the increase in monies for OPD in the mayor's budget.  A community's values are reflected in their budget. This policing model that we have has never made Oaklanders more safe. We cannot afford the fiscal irresponsibility of OPD continuing to dominate Oakland's budget. I support APTP and refunding public safety.  One example of safety I wanted to highlight is traffic safety. Six cars on my small residential street have been totaled by speeding cars, including two of my own. When I spoke to an OPD officer who came out, he stated that rules against racist profiling have meant to OPD that they will refuse to work on traffic safety. A pedestrian was just killed by a speeder on Park Boulevard this month.  OPD seems to have abandoned traffic safety, those monies need to go elsewhere. Additionally, as a former teachers union member, I wanted to ask that macro employees be represented by a union and be salaried.

I am an elected member of the Alameda Democratic Central Committee, also a resident of District 7, as well as part of the East Oakland Democratic Club. So I have a couple of comments.  The first one is why are we not running an independent audit to look at our previous spending and also making sure that the money that was allocated is being used to what it was intended to prior to us building a new budget. I think we're able to possibly find loopholes or find if there's money that wasn't spent and use it for better purpose. So that's my first comment. My second comment is before  We support giving more grant money to Oakland Promise. I believe there's an investigation. So I'm a little bit concerned that we're not letting the investigation go through first prior to us providing funds for that grant.  As a previous educator, I'm all about education. Don't take it wrong. But I'm just concerned that there's an investigation and we're giving more funding without us knowing what the basis of this investigation is. And number three is I know that it was stated that we shouldn't talk about the Howard Terminal. However, my livelihood is potentially...  compromise with that move. And I think it is important and it is part of a budget. It is part of a money that is coming into the city. So I do not understand why it's not being allowed to speak of. The council meets in private, so we should be able to also speak  when an item is not on the agenda, especially something that's going to affect the city of Oakland. So I am very concerned because the Howard Terminal, again, it's going to impact more than just the union workers that are there. It's also going to impact the manufacturers and all the companies that use that port to conduct business. So this is everyone in the northern part of California. We service so many, so we're the third largest port  port of the West, and it's going to hurt so much that we are building this Howard Terminal without taking into consideration all the domino effect that it's going to cause on all the industries that are part of that port, not just that area.

First of all, please give MACRO enough funding to succeed and expand. The mayor's budget allocates 2.8 million for the initial pilot over two years. This is not enough to make the program effective. Secondly, echoing many other callers, MACRO jobs need to be well-paid.  say 70K annually with union protection. The salary that has been dedicated to this of $22 an hour is not enough to make this happen.

We're appalled at any suggestion from city administration that macro jobs come in at $22 an hour. Macro needs to be fully funded for the pilot  Followed by full funding and maximum funding for maximum expansion as soon as possible throughout the city, particularly starting in key neighborhoods where there's a large OPD footprint currently. This is central to any reallocation of public safety funding. Macro must be highly valued skilled jobs, not clinicians, but well-trained community people with relevant experience.  Implement macro according to the year of research and community engagement by urban strategies. Macro originated from the police commission's hearing in West Oakland on OPD and the unhoused and the subsequent report over two years ago with over 75 unhoused community members showing up and testifying to their experiences.  The concept that came out of that hearing and the research and community engagement that followed was a systemic intervention into the OPD footprint by interrupting 911 calls where a police response is inappropriate and not just calls defined as quote unquote mental health. This will be a major reduction to the broadest possible range of potentially harmful OPD crisis interventions. Pay these workers well. Treat the macro model from its inception as a value  essential workforce at a level comparable to the respect and compensation we ask for firefighters and the police.  It's also unconscionable as we bring macro into the fire department and ask that they be respected and paid well to overwork firefighters, cut their budget and increase overtime. This affects their physical and mental health, it endangers our neighborhoods, it's not acceptable. So let's treat the firefighters the way they deserve and bring our macro workers as we develop this new model  which will be really a remarkable transformation of the public safety system and offer an alternative that everybody I ever hear, even people who I know opposed it when it was first proposed, are now all in support of it. I've never seen anything quite so popular so quickly.  So we need to fully fund macro.

They didn't kill anyone. What's going on here in Oakland?  We're cutting the fire department when we're approaching fire season. I was here during the firestorm. It was absolutely horrible.

We need to fund that organization to continue their work and expand their work in East Oakland.

My name is Gabriela Galicia, and I am the executive director of Street Level Health Project that is located in District 5, which houses the City of Oakland Day Labor Program and has been under contract with the city since 2014. We are also a part of the Refund Coalition, and I am speaking on behalf today of the reinvesting in protections for frontline and essential workers. Street Level has remained as a hub for day laborers and  during the COVID-19 pandemic and one of the only organizations responding to the needs of this community. Many were hit financially but also physically as many contracted the virus from being exposed waiting for work, employers who didn't follow protocols, and living in overcrowded housing. We must include the day labor program in our economic recovery plan to ensure that most the most vulnerable can sustain themselves and their families.  Circumstances due to the COVID-19 pandemic have exacerbated issues of food insecurity, intensified health issues such as chronic illness, anxiety, depression, and reduced economic opportunities. At the beginning of the pandemic, workers had reported that jobs had decreased by over 90% at the six hiring sites throughout Oakland. They did not have a social safety net to fall back on.  We are hoping that we are able to continue the funding for our collaborative, which is made up of Centro Legal de la Raza, Causa Justa, and Street Level Health Project, and be funded at the base amount of $220,000, which is $440,000 total. We hope to continue to work with you in regards to the minimum wage outreach and education as well that we're a part of.  the Fair Labor Oakland.

So I'm just gonna come off from the top of my head about MACRA, I'm from Faith in Action. How has that agreement been reached to pay people on MACRA about $22 an hour? I mean, that is an unacceptable pay wage when the average rent in Oakland is upwards $2,600. I mean, that is a foundation of failure.  Because $22 an hour is a pay rate. Where would one live for about $1,100 a month, which is about $1,500 less than rent, $250 less than food, upwards $300 is fitting a family, $150 less than utilities, more for family, $150 less than transportation, even more if what? If you have a family. $150 less than toiletries, but you must add more if you have a family.  MACRA is supposed to be staffed with people from the community to service the community. Jobs that lack a community, that lack city attention with overflowing city-owned trash cans, no street sweeping, no parking enforcement, abandoning wrecked and stripped cars littering the neighborhood, incredibly large communities of unhoused human persons and families under freeway overpasses, people sleeping in their cars in places they deem safe to park,  Wartime-like gunfire accompanied by homicides every few days. You want to pay $22 an hour to adults living in a community where babies are being born and homeless in cabinets? Mom and pop stores no longer thrive in neighborhoods where it could be community businesses, but instead are boarding up buildings and empty lots full of trash? What country is this? What state is this? What city is this? $22 an hour? What century was that?  where you could sustain yourself and your family for $22 an hour.",Economic Development

I'm thinking about how Oakland Police Department has gotten buckets and buckets of money and we're not safe. And many are in real danger. So reducing people's contact with police to refund healing and life sustaining things that can address root causes is the way to go. I support APTP, the Defund Coalition, the proposal brought by Carol Fife and Nikki Fortunato-Boss.  There's so much harm and suffering and injustice not addressed by the mayor's budget. I think how beautiful and healing what could happen. All the things that could blossom when there's permanently affordable housing for everyone. Remembering as I heard so wisely and powerfully said recently that housing justice is racial justice. When there's good protected union jobs for meaningful work,  When there's clean green streets and parks and libraries, all neighborhoods need trees and gardens, playgrounds. When children and youth programs and care for elders and transformative justice and the artists that feed our souls and clarify and expand our vision, when all those things are resourced, that's the Oakland that we can have.

I'm a District 2 resident myself, and I'm a renter. I'm here today as part of the Refund Oakland Coalition. We're calling on council to pass a people's budget that helps all Oaklanders achieve a just recovery,  One that prioritizes restoring and reinvesting in services for residents. Everybody in Oakland deserves clean, well-maintained streets and infrastructure, open, accessible parks and libraries, and cultural programs. And those Oaklanders who have been deemed essential, the workers who have been on the front lines delivering services, many of them in the field without the luxury of working remotely for their own safety, deserve better protections and treatment than they've gotten.  Across the city, we see sky-high vacancy rates and an unfair, abusive reliance on so-called temporary, part-time workers who were summarily cut loose and removed from their schedules at the beginning of the pandemic. The workers deserve better than this, and the residents of Oakland deserve better than a stretched-thin workforce that is continually being asked to do more with less, with staffing levels still well under where they were before the recession. Not the most recent recession, the 2008 recession.  Oakland deserves a budget that does better, but none of this can happen unless the rich pay their fair share. Council must prioritize progressive revenue measures so that it can pass a budget that respects us, protects us, and invests in us. Thank you.",General Community Organizing

Today I'm speaking as a representative of a coalition of artists, educators, administrators, and cultural workers to express our strong support for the restoration and reinvestment in our city's artists and cultural sector through the reallocation of funds from the Oakland Police Department.  When we talk about art and culture in Oakland, we're talking about the soul of our city. We're talking about the revitalization of our city. And for too long, the arts and culture sector has been drained of funds while the police budget has tripled.

We need your help in restoring what few resources the city's Cultural Affairs Division and Oakland community of artists have lost in these difficult times.  I would also like to lift up council members Fife, Fortunata Bass, Tao and Kaplan who are supporters of the arts and culture sector. Please know that we support you and hope that you can continue to move the needle as we restore funding to the arts and culture to the levels it deserves.

The mayor would tell you that she's just gonna replace those full-time employees by increasing the overtime budget. But we're already so short staffed that our paramedics are routinely working 120 hours a week. You heard that right, 120 hours is unsustainable mandatory overtime. You talk to my members about this overwork and you will hear about marriages falling apart,  mental health crises, fatigue that presents them from adequately doing this job that they love. And it's in the teeth of this staffing crisis that the mayor proposes cutting another 29 firefighters. It's unconscionable. Moreover, this is a two-step dance we're looking at here. This year, they say cutting employees is no big deal because they're going to increase the overtime budget. But next year, they'll say, my God, look at the overtime. And when they cut that, firehouse closures become inevitable.  Council, you've seen our work caring for the victims of COVID. You've seen the days the sky turned red from these wildfires. And I know you've seen it because you all tweet about what a great job we're doing saving the lives of your constituents. And yeah, the tweets are super cool. I dig the tweets.

And so I would respectfully request that you consider healthier support for the cultural sector in the proposed budget. And I wanna underline all the previous eloquent speakers to this issue in the budget. I agree with them. The sector has suffered outsized damage from being first out last in during the pandemic.  Many Oakland organizations didn't qualify for PPP loans just for the crime of being small. And many of our artists were shut out of unemployment benefits for being gig workers. And our BIPOC cultural workers have experienced higher levels of unemployment and loss than their white counterparts. So not only has there been outsized damage to the sector, but also this sector is vital  for our recovery, for all of the reasons that have been stated and because we are entrepreneurs, because the sector is innovative and so is the Cultural Affairs Division. They have brought in money from the outside. If they just weren't hampered, if they had more staff and more money to work with, they would also have an outsized impact on the recovery of the city.

I'm calling to urge council to reject Libby Schaaf's appalling and destructive budget proposal and follow through on your promise last summer to defund OPD by 50% and refund our community. Libby's obscene and reckless proposal would give yet more money to the cops, even after thousands of Oakland residents have risen up and demanded the opposite. Even in the wake of the largest civil rights protest movement in history, Schaaf has come down on the wrong side of history and she's chosen white supremacy.  For every dollar she wants to give to police, she's proposing just nine cents  on housing and community development in the total budget. And the general fund is even worse. For every dollar on police, she wants to spend less than a penny on housing and community development and less than a penny on violence prevention. This is backwards. She doesn't give a damn about rising homicide rates, it's clear. Police don't prevent violence anyways. And after failing so miserable to do anything to stem the rising homicide rate, why would we give more money to such an agency?  Only 4% of OPD calls are even for violent crime. So we could significantly reduce the OPD budget without any negative impact on public safety.  I support APTP and the Defund Police Coalition's priority recs from the Reimagining Public Safety Task Force, several of which this council prioritized in a unanimous resolution put forward by Council Member Fyfe and Council President Bass just a few weeks ago. We expect to see those recs implemented in this year's budget. We're counting on y'all.  Those recs include fully funding macro, non-911 MH crisis response, gender-based violence prevention response and survivor supports, community violence interrupters, harm reduction and transformative justice services, and housing, housing, housing, as well as capping OPD overtime.

First and foremost, supporting Zach Unger's comments about having a full complement of sworn officers. Second, the funds for clearing city properties have fallen to, quote, traditional $1.1 million per year, less than half of what anyone thinks is needed.  In the last biennial, council and community agreed that it was a reasonable amount, about $2 million a year. That only accounted for 80% of the city lands. We've had a couple of drought years and those are more frequent and more extreme. So it seems as if $2.5 million would be reasonable at this time. Instead,  The budget provides us with an additional fire inspector to tell us that high compliance from residents who spend thousands of dollars a year personally to provide a buffer between and among our houses and the rest of the city, the high winds don't discriminate. They send the embers and the smoke everywhere in the city.  So instead let's hire some goats like about 60 of them we could get for 500 bucks a piece and a thousand dollars a year of maintenance. Second fire prevention issue is the Interdepartmental Wildfire Task Force chaired by Joe DeVries has done an outstanding job using quite a bit of OFD and OPD overtime  We need overtime also for parking technicians on red flag days. So let's please fund an ounce of prevention for a pound of cure. Thank you so much.",Public Safety and Law Enforcement

I'm a District 1 resident. My name is Mary Lanigan. I live on Caldecott Lane near the freeway and the Caldecott Tunnel. And this morning I'm speaking on behalf of myself and of Ann Smolka.  who is the co-founder of the Caldecott Tunnel Fourth Boar Coalition, a coalition of Oakland and Berkeley neighborhood groups who fought for better environmental mitigations for the Caldecott Tunnel Improvement Project. And we're asking on behalf of neighbors in our area, we have a petition with about 570 signatures to please move the Caldecott Tunnel sidewalk from the unfunded to the funded CIP list or direct staff to help find grant funds to complete the project.  In 2008, Oakland City's Council voted to accept an $8 million settlement agreement with Caltrans for Caldecott Tunnel improvement project mitigations and enhancements, and these funds were to be spent on pedestrian and bike safety improvement projects.  the mitigation projects would complete streets, especially in areas here, which were immediately adjacent to the fourth floor construction site. Yet 13 years later, projects two through four, which include our long-awaited sidewalk,  which are immediately adjacent to the fourth bore are incomplete. Oakland has already spent $618,000 at least to design these projects. They're shovel ready. And we really don't want to see that that money has been spent in vain. Residents in the area here who rely on public rotation  and access to public services and who also endured four years of round-the-clock construction and excavation that benefited motorists are still in a position where we're walking on Caldecott Lane and Tunnel Road in the streets competing with bikes and cars to get to public services.

My name is Tiara, and I am a theater maker, curator, teaching artist, and resident of District 3. I'm asking the city council to move forward a budget that supports the restoration and reinvestment in Oakland's artists and cultural sector as a pathway to racial equity, violence prevention, and a just recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. I'm sure everyone here has a story about how Oakland arts and culture kept them going through the pandemic.  Whether it was streaming music or storytelling from creatives who kept putting out work during shelter in place or taking in the awe-inspiring murals put up across the city during the Black Lives Matter uprisings last spring and summer. Arts and culture spaces serve as community resource centers for key health and healing services, emotional support, creative expression, and places to build connections for our communities. Investing in Oakland's arts and culture sector is an investment in racial equity and our city's health and wellness and our young people and our elders,  and vibrant yet chronically marginalized residents and our city's call to reimagine public safety and collective healing and an investment in belonging for all who call Oakland home. Almost 30 years ago, the city's cultural affairs division had a grants budget of 1.6 million, the equivalent of 3 million in today's dollars. Yet for over 15 years, the city's cultural affairs division grants budget has stagnated at about 1 million despite the escalating cost of living in the Bay Area.  This is all despite the fact that before the pandemic in 2017, artists poured over $80 million into Oakland's local economy and hired over 1500 employees and 2500 contractors and served hundreds of thousands of community members with programs designed to heal, celebrate and restore.  I am asking the city council to move forward a budget that defunds OPD by 50% and reinvest millions of that money into the city's cultural funding program and in restoring staff positions to the cultural affairs division.

And I do want to add my voice to urge the city council members to rectify Mayor Schaaf's underfunding of macro. If we're calling for a just recovery from COVID, we must pay macro employees at least $33 an hour. To suggest that they earn less is undervaluing their roles, missing an opportunity to create good jobs for our local community members,  and significantly increasing the risk of high turnover and poor outcomes for the new program. Our shared goal is to cover 24 seven operations and expansion as soon as the pilot is demonstrating effectiveness. Realistically, these goals are going to require a substantially higher investment. It's also vitally important that you fully fund the ceasefire program with COVID driven spike in gun violence. Our city needs this proven approach more now than ever before.  Each element of the ceasefire is crucial. In addition to the OPD budget, adequate funding for ceasefire life coaches and for the resources that they can offer to our men and women at risk to support them in transitioning away from gun violence is crucial. We also strongly recommend that you make provision for revitalizing community involvement in the OPD procedural justice training. Ceasefire can and should be all about communities we are serving.

Good afternoon and thanks to the council people who sat through a very long meeting.

He said that he didn't know where the $22 an hour came from, but he also indicated that he thought that was the...  going rate for EMTs. Presumably he's talking about EMTs at private ambulance companies. A woefully underpaid job causing very high turnover and  But also the reason that it shouldn't be compared to the EMTs is because it's a very different job. This is a job that really does not have any comparison to any other job that's being done in the area. It's a brand new program. It's a brand new model.  It was developed by Oaklanders based on the needs and the resources and the neighborhoods of Oakland for Oakland. And I would urge that the city administration spend more time talking to the community as they make these decisions and do this research. And I think that will help alleviate some of the miscommunication.  I totally support paying EMTs more, but that's not the subject for the macro responders. The subject for the macro responders is how to pay them well for a very difficult job that they're going to do and that hopefully Oakland intends to support and ensure the success of the program with excellent employees and low turnover.

My name is Shannon Bowman, and I'm with the nonprofit street level health project, Salud Para Todos, which houses the City of Oakland Day Labor Program, also known as the Oakland Workers Collective, La Colectiva. I'm also a native Oaklander and property owner here in Oakland. I'm speaking today because I want to ensure that the city budget supports Oakland's most vulnerable communities.  Oakland's Day Laborers or jornaleros, the Maya mom speaking indigenous community, low income community members, and those who are undocumented, and others who fall through the cracks. Regardless of documentation status, these community members are vital members of the local economy and are some of those who have been hit hardest by the pandemic, and many of whom actually don't qualify for economic stimulus money or unemployment funds.  Day laborers have been faced with a lack of jobs, and when they do work, often face unsafe working conditions and are victims of wage theft and other employer abuses. And I just want to point out that these laborers do some of the hardest jobs here in the city, and they really support all of us here and our overall economy. So I just want to say that if we're trying to heal the economy as a whole and view this from an equity standpoint, we must include the day labor program as well as programs for essential low-wage workers and our economic recovery plan  to ensure those most vulnerable can sustain themselves and their families. These include dedicated funding for labor standards enforcement and maintaining funding for the Fair Labor Oakland community-based education, outreach and monitoring work. Funds like this directly uplift our lowest income neighborhoods and therefore uplift all of Oakland. And they also fit under the council budget priorities for good jobs and a vibrant economy and also the city's overarching economic development priorities.  So I just want to mention lastly that funding like this that supports these programs are just a drop in the bucket relative to the city's entire budget and support hundreds of individuals and families in Oakland. So redirecting funds from the OPD into community programs that uplift the people and really treat the cause rather than the symptoms make a huge impact.

We're very concerned that the monies from these two measures are not being used as they were intended.  So we would like very much for that to be re-looked at. We think the whole budget actually is just a recapitulation of prior budgets made easier because the federal government has deposited some $58 million, which is being used to fill gaps in the budget so that it can be exactly the same that's always been. That needs to change.  The mayor proposes a budget. It is the city council's budget that actually gets adopted and passed. The city council needs to take this budget and go back to the beginning. We've got to do some things different. Things cannot be continued to be done the same way. We'll get the same results. The homeless group has submitted a budget for homelessness needs.

I'd like to take my time to commend David Ferguson and his team.  on their hard work remediating the blight caused by illegal dumping. In addition to the work they do in reaction, once dumps have taken place, they also work with us to address strategies for prevention of this behavior. OPW's team of environmental enforcement officers,  have partnered with waste management staff to perform zone walks in commercial areas, auditing properties that are open for business, but not signed up for garbage service. Our most recent informal audit indicated that a few blocks on a busy commercial corridor contained 13 businesses, of which only five were signed up with waste management accounts.  As you can imagine, without waste management services, garbage might end up in bags next to litter containers, in overflowing residential carts, or elsewhere on Oakland city streets. Given this information, I'd like to recommend that the city take measures to better enforce appropriate use of our services, such as tying a requirement for garbage service to the process of attaining a business license.  KOCB has been a great partner to waste management in the fight against illegal dumping, but there's still a lot of work to do.

Earlier this year, the executive director for the commission submitted a budget request to the city's budget administrator for three new positions to be added to the commission's budget and staff structure. As the 2021-2023 budget proposal was developed, the administrator's team indicated that the PEC would receive one new position. However,  That new position was pulled by the mayor just days before she published and released her budget. We believe the budget administrator had it right in acknowledging the need for at least one new position for the PEC. Our current resources are insufficient for the PEC to fulfill our legally required responsibilities and meet our city's current ethics needs. Since 2014, no new positions have been added or provided to the commission by the mayor of the city council despite significant increases in demand.  for ethics prevention, disclosure, and enforcement services, and repeated requests over the past several years for more positions.

Thank you that you have three language interpretation channels available today.  In the past year, all around the SFA area, we may have overcompensated and overspent in police budget and infrastructure services, and possibly in the attempts to bolster, reinforce, and to be more fully prepared for possible natural disaster events in the next two to five to 10 years. Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf has again been asking for another year of what can feel like strange police budget increases, possibly to continue to address  both neighborhood violence and natural disaster preparedness ideas. Interestingly, Oakland City Council may be learning to ask, have we enough prepared the OPD? And is now a time to better consider how equity, the reimagined task force and health and human services ideas and youth services can have more of a part in our lives.  As Oakland and the SF area simply have to be considering wildfires, sea level rise, climate change issues, and to worry of a possible large barrier earthquake in 2023 or sometime in the next decade, natural disaster preparedness programs can very much help contribute to the current city budget ideas and programs of equity, reimagine, and health and human services, youth services, and the arts.  To respect the work and good intentions of Councilperson Fife, I'm not trying to offer chicken little disguise falling scare tactics or for natural disaster preparedness ideas to be used like a political football. I feel to more openly talk about natural disaster preparedness ideas can work towards overall better reasoning and less harm to people and can give more clear, less confused, better direction in community advocacy and local government  and how to better prepare city planning projects and budgets in the next few years and decade. I very much would thank you to Oakland City Council in the many ways.",Governance and Civic Engagement

In general, I support the BAS-CAL-5-GIO budget, but I did want to make a couple of specific comments. With regard to additional police academies, please evaluate the efficacy and the hiring results of any existing academies before promising funding for additional academies, which might not even help us.  It seems like it would make pretty good sense to check the results since we understand that actual police officers hired is a rather low number.  If you have money, here's what to use it for. Fund sanitation and water for more encampment sites. As of this morning's very late addendum, the administration claims they're serving 40 encampments with porta potties. Okay, but they counted about 140 encampments. It will improve our residential neighborhoods and the health of the homeless.  to increase sanitation services instead of just putting up with contaminated parks, neighborhoods, and bodies of water. I support the comments and questions posed by Brooke Levin with respect to the Measure Q funds, and I encourage very careful oversight of that funding because we asked the voters for a lot of money, but we did say what it was for.

In addition to what has been stated, we support continuing the vital work of resilience in communities  after stress and trauma. ReCast has made trauma-informed healing spaces in traditional systems for Black and Brown communities and made a positive impact on OYAC. ReCast helped facilitate OYAC's youth and youth mini grants program when there wasn't a staff position field. ReCast even funded the remaining Public Safety Task Force Youth Advisory Board when it needed more time to continue building and lay restorative circles for youth. Commissioners,  when we critically need a space to process the unrest of this past year. By funding recast, you will provide a real solution that actually helps those working in traditional systems get trauma-informed support. We understand that you have heard from many adults with more privilege than we have, and we're hoping that you will listen to our generation and represent as well. Consider the fact that many youth are already voting, and even more will be voting in the next election cycle.  Youth are the present and the future of Oakland.

I reject the mayor's budget. I also reject council member Taylor's budget. I cannot believe that as we're coming out of this pandemic, we are actually talking about  putting COVID dollars towards the police instead of mental health, housing, job training, parks, recreation, youth programs, and everything else that is desperately needed for us to recover as a city. I support the recommendations of APTP and the Reimagining Public Safety Task Force, which was designed to reduce OPD's budget by 50%, which none of these proposals actually do.  I support funding macro in full so that we can actually see it work. I am very afraid that what the current setup is, is that these alternatives to policing are being deliberately underfunded and under-resourced so that city council can come back next year and say, see, these alternatives to policing didn't work.  So we need to give more money still to OPD, which already has over 40% of the city's budget and does not keep us safe. I was at the vigil a couple of days ago. The police did not prevent the shooting at Lake Merritt. They do not prevent crime in this city.  Resources like MACRO, resources like the Office of Violence Prevention, youth programs, housing, parks, all of the nonprofits that we heard of, like Homies Empowerment, the Urban Peace Movement, Courage, Ella Baker Center, et cetera. Those are the resources that keep us safe. So I ask the city council to support Councilmember Bass and Fife's plan, fully fund MACRO and these other alternatives to policing so that we can actually show that they work.  rather than underfunding them so that they fail.

My name is Woods Irvin and I stand with the Defund OPD Coalition in demanding that the city council move for the recommendations put forth by the coalition and reject increases to the police budget. It is important to increase community safety programs and not accompanying them  with more funds for policing. Spending more money on expanding the overtime for OPD and additional cop academies will only increase the level of violence of policing that Oaklanders experience. Police do not prevent violence. To propose budget amendments suspending COVID-19 ARPA funds for a fifth cop academy is a slap in the face to Oakland residents in need after this horrific year.  We need to prioritize things like jobs and housing, especially given the ending of eviction moratorium at the end of the month. In a recent poll conducted by Oakwood Rising of over 1100 Black, Latino, and Indigenous people, mostly from the flats, it was found that 65% of those surveys did not want an increase in funding to police.  The manufactured fear-mongering to push back against demands to defund cannot be kowtowed to. We must prioritize prevention and intervention methods that do not increase the risk of violence to Black, Brown, and Indigenous young folks and Oaklanders in general, such as a well-funded macro program, again, without increased monies towards policing.  Please move forward with the recommendations put forth by the Defund OPD Coalition, supported by Councilmembers Bass and Fife.

I'm sure you've read emails about Homies. And also, I just want to speak and really underscore the words of Dr. G. Reyes and Diego Rodriguez about what Homies actually, the operation, how Homies actually is, the how, pardon me. First, Homies Empowerment isn't a cute brand or logo, but a living mantra that we don't need heroes, sheroes,  them rose, we need empowered communities to make lasting change in the town. That we are not waiting to be saved, nor need saving from. These words came from a homie's dinner, and I carry them with me into every space I share with adults and youth. Second, the Homies Freedom Store is not charity, it is a vessel for community wealth. As a ritual, before starting our Tuesdays, we stand in circle and share our whys for the day.  Upon opening, community members in line are offered coffee or water, greeted with a smile and familial conversation, and shielded from the Oakland rain or shine with several canopies. One morning, after working in the heat with PPE, a volunteer leaned over and said, don't sweat it, they did it for us, and we can do it for them. This is the ethos of homies.  that we are all interconnected. We respect and have respect for elders and the ancestors, and that it truly takes a . Homies Empowerment is a transcendent movement, and it is one that has personally changed my life from how I raised my son and teach youth to how I honor my wife and the women in my life.

I am the homeless black advocate, Lake Merritt. I'd like to say I'd like all that money returned from the GoFundMe to its rightful owners, please. I heard a young lady speak about bathrooms in the black district where kids are in playgrounds and have no place to use the bathroom. As you know, kids don't run home. A lot of them just use the bathroom on the spot.  I think since I hear that the Parks Department, Mr. Riley, maybe you ought to consider not spending money on resurfacing six tennis courts and spend some of that money on bathrooms in the poor districts. I think bathrooms are very important. We don't want kids having to urinate out in public. It can cause a lot of bad stuff to happen, if you know what I mean.  I'd like to also talk quickly about tomorrow is the sentencing for Derek Chauvin. Let's pay attention to that. Jeffrey's is a place that has always fed the homeless on Thanksgiving.

I appreciate that you, the council, are here to consider our municipal budget. I urge you not to rush through something, but to be thoughtful and devote your consciences.  There's a narrative being pushed nationally which seems to resonate locally with people underserved by OPD. A vivid example of the national spin I saw today, a screenshot from CNN where they'd flip the X axis on a graph to tell their audience that violent crime is rising when in fact over the last few years it has been decreasing as shown by the graph they were showing.  In the last couple of weeks discussing this budget, proposals for it, the city's accountants and OPD have asserted that they don't have the accounting expertise on staff. They don't have the statistical expertise  to analyze the budget and be precise about ways, evaluating the quality of different kinds of service that OPD provides. But I would urge you not to make reform wait.  Don't fall for bad faith claims that reform will cause more violence. Don't fall for the assertion that proof that an effort will cause improvements must be provided before reform is attempted. Don't put police in charge of alternatives to policing.  I think that if we reform merely the millions of dollars they overspend on overtime, we can pay for everything we want.",Police Reform

I'm one of five community members at Homies Empowerment who came together to form El Equipo de Cariño, the care team, and I'm also a born and raised Oakland resident. I'm calling in today the voice that we should not put more money into the police department. Currently at Homies Empowerment, currently Homies Empowerment is 12 years old, and I want to note that we have never been funded by the city of Oakland.  In the beginning of Homies Empowerment, main focus was youth development, which started at Castlemont High and Fremont High School. We are now up and running the Freedom Store, which distributes food, diapers, and toiletries for our town, our city, for free every Tuesday. We also have a learning center on Seminary Ave, which is currently serving cultural and ethnic relevant classes to Oakland's youth. Every middle school in East Oakland is currently represented in this cohort. I also want to mention that  All the materials and all the classes are free for the community. Coming real soon, July 1st, we're moving into the new care center. What I can say is that during the pandemic in December 2020, the care team put out that it takes a lot of COVID relief fund, which we redistributed $86,000 to help the people pay for bills. That's just one thing we've gotten done. We're also now working on acquiring 20,000 square feet where we can work with our neighbors to grow our own food.  All these things were a few dreams that the community wanted to see and is being delivered by the people for the people. I'm asking you to get with the people, our families, our youth. Support our futures, our babies, not the cops. Thank you for your time. Thank you for listening. And thank you for those who have shown up in solidarity with the community.

I'm Dr. GT Reyes Tagailog Kampapangan, Associate Professor of Educational Leadership at CSU East Bay, a father and a longtime organizational leader, educator, and organizer living out of East Oakland, District 7.  Thank you City Council for the work that you're doing to try to rethink the budget. I'm here today on behalf of budget amendments that aim to divert funding allocated to the police and instead towards community-based organizations like Homeless Empowerment, which has existed in the community in various forms in Oakland for well over a decade.  Home Meets Empowerment with its foci on community care and cultivation, liberatory education, and food justice, it has a demonstrated track record of working alongside community in ways that aim beyond merely survival and aiming towards self-determination and emancipation.  And that work that Homies Empowerment does is not easy. And as some of us may know, such work requires political clarity and commitment to always deepen that clarity through its ongoing work and reflection. And I believe Homies Empowerment does just that while also engaging in a project of reframing and reimagining. And in other words, Homies doesn't just serve the communities who have been institutionally marginalized and socially pathologized, or rather demonized, displaced, and discarded,  Homi's empowerment simultaneously challenges the singularly defined perceptions of how certain communities are perceived as dangerous, damaged, lacking, and reframes them instead as communities with legitimate values, strengths, and aspirations, like District 7. And in doing this, H.E., Homi's empowerment also tries to work towards a future absent of systems of oppression and institutions of repression. Homi's empowerment in the name itself seeks to reframe and reimagine dominant conceptions of the Homi.  And so Homies Empowerment does this work because lives and future generations of lives depend on it. With a real allocation of funds on the budget towards Homies Empowerment and other community-based organizations, we can deepen and sustain the work towards an Oakland that we all deserve.",Police Reform

A lot of people have been saying that they do want more investments into the community, which is something that I strongly would like as well. However, if we're constantly not having some type of enforcement from our city and also from OPD, then we're not going to be able to enjoy that. So just like at the lake, I mean, they're saying that there were 60 officers out there. I'm not for sure if that's actually true. However,  We cannot, OPD, of course, OPD cannot control who's going to pick up a gun, nor can a civilian control who's going to pick up a gun. So at the end of the day, there has to be a balance across the board with what's coming to our community and also who is protecting us, because we're not going to be able to enjoy half of the things that we would like to have in a city if we're constantly letting everything fly.

First, I want to thank our Progressive City Council members for working so tirelessly to better our city.  I'm calling on our city council to reinvest resources in housing the unsheltered, creating more affordable housing in equitable city services and in programs that actually keep us safe. I'm also calling on city council to reject all amendments that divert city and federal resources like COVID-19 funding toward a severely bloated police department. I've worked in the service industry in District 1 for seven years now.  Me and most people I know lost our jobs during COVID-19 and weren't paid. I don't know why we would direct COVID-19 funding towards anything else. I've been bartending at Temescal Brewing since we opened five years ago. We had never had a violent encounter at our brewery until last year.  And each incident was from someone who was clearly in need of mental health support. Police do not have the resources to help people in a mental health crisis. Police are not violence preventers. They are violence responders. Not to mention, I don't feel comfortable calling police because I don't trust that everyone will make it out of that encounter alive.  We need a mental health first responder team like MACRO to be available 24-7. We can't stop there. We need to redirect funds towards helping the houseless by purchasing transitional housing spaces like hotels and motels. We need to invest in affordable housing. Last summer's protests were the largest in U.S. history. The people have spoken. We want to divest from police and reinvest in community. Thank you for your time.",Homelessness

I support the council president's budget and all of the cooperating council members that created it.  because it prioritizes housing, job training, violence prevention, such as macro. And I'd also like to suggest like Oakland family clinics, like street doctors that go to the unhoused communities like Venice, California already has. And we need to reallocate the resources to invest in services  and access to health care, youth services, mental health, cultural art programs for kids and everybody, really, and urban farming, things like that. Rehousing, we need to build more BMR units.  We need to create a more effective and efficient RAP department, rental registry for landlords, and create a building acquisition fund or invest in that if we don't already.  For the unhoused that are trying to live with dignity, we need to stop the sweeps from Caltrans, and we need to fund support for basic services such as porta-potties, showers, trash pickup, electricity, water, and Wi-Fi. And finally, stop putting barriers, fines, and fees from the building department for those that are trying to create collective community with dignity.  while they remain unhoused. Re-police investment, if there is any at all to be done, it should be to provide training for them to attend health intervention, training sessions, to learn to approach, deescalate, and best speak to people in difficult situations. LAPD already has this in place. Anyway, it should be mandatory. That's the only investment I can see. Thank you for your time.",Homelessness

I'm a senior campaign director at the East Bay Alliance for Sustainable Economy. We're a proud member of the Refund Oakland and Defund OPD coalitions. I live in Deep East Oakland, District 7, a neighborhood directly and severely impacted by the COVID pandemic, violent crime, homelessness, blight, sideshows,  historical disinvestment, and so on. Though I'm not an Oakland native, I've lived here for 19 years. I've watched the city change over time, for better or worse, and I care very deeply about what happens in my community and how our collective resources are invested. We support Council President Bass and Council Members Spife, Gallo, and Kalb's budget proposal. Thank you for your tremendous work to put forward a budget that prioritizes housing, job training, worker protections, public services, parks, and arts and culture.  We especially want to thank you for the critical steps you've taken to lay the groundwork for creating a public safety infrastructure that will truly prevent violence in our city and offer another pathway forward. My friends and I were robbed at gunpoint outside my apartment when I lived on Sixth Avenue in District two back in 2010. Since I moved to 104th Ave in late 2013, I know of at least two homicides of young men that occurred within a three block radius of my home.  Their names were Lee and Noel. Lee was about 13 years old and Noel 16 or 17. I don't know all the circumstances of their murders, but I know their lives were taken senselessly and their families, friends and communities are utterly heartbroken and devastated at their loss. Our community as a whole is suffering and we're trying to address many grave issues in this budget and beyond.  Critical thinking, social values, and logical analysis suggest that reallocating funds from an ineffective police department and redirecting those resources toward comprehensive violence prevention is the right thing to do. We urge the council to stand together and to support the budget team's proposal, reject any amendments that increase funding.",Governance and Civic Engagement

I'm the policy director for the Anti-Police Terror Project. I'm sure you've all heard about me speak about the need to defund OPD over the last six years, but today I want to speak about the voices I want to make sure are represented in this conversation.  As a member of the re-imagining public safety process, I'm gonna lift up three presentations from organizations that have deep relationships in Oakland. These organizations, Urban Peace Movement, Courage and Oakland Rising, engage their communities and engaged in polling and focus groups that surveyed them. I don't have time to lift up the whole presentations, but here are some highlights.  Urban peace movement engaged Black men from Oakland, nearly 75% of whom were from East Oakland. 87% felt they were less safe when they see OPD in their community. A large majority said they feel they prefer less police or non-police violence intervention over more police. Oakland Rising conducted a poll of over 1,100 Oaklanders  The majority of them from the flatlands, the majority of them identifying as BIPOC. 65% of poll respondents wanted to defund the police by 50% and use those funds to invest in community. 78% of BIPOC respondents from the flatlands feel less safe when they see OPD, including 40% who feel very unsafe. And respondents wanted more investment in housing, violence prevention, mental health, and less investment in OPD.  So when we talk about what black and brown Oaklanders want, let's make sure we represent all the data we have, not just data that supports our positions. Similarly, I've heard mentioned in public meetings about principles that the public safety task force did not pass. I would request if the principles are discussed, we discussed the principles that actually passed  not ones that advance a narrative. I'm a black member of the task force. I live in District 7. I work with a lot of black and brown advisory board members who live in impacted districts, and we believe in the mission to defend the police by 50%. Let's not erase us. And let's not erase the words from Police Chief Laurent Armstrong after the tragic shooting at Lake Merritt. He said, I don't believe that we can police our way out of a problem like this. If we had 100 or 200 officers, it doesn't mean that someone won't do something dumb. It doesn't mean that someone won't pull out a gun and use it. Thank you.",Police Reform

That's money for Oakland residents struggling to survive the pandemic, feed their families and stay in their homes. It's appalling that we're even considering it an emblematic of everything that's wrong in this town, which has become a dystopian police state with growing shanty towns, crumbling infrastructure and rising violence.  Council President Bass and her team have given us a chance to begin to try something new, to start to reimagine safety by funding violence prevention, plus housing, jobs, macro 2047 crisis response, and more of what actually keeps us safe. It has been disgusting to see OPD and OPOA exploit tragedies like what happened on Juneteenth to lie about city council members and the defund movement, even though nothing has been defunded yet.  And the chief himself admitted no amount of cops could have prevented what went down on Juneteenth. It's so typical of the Oakland police. They lie all the time through their teeth. And I think we sometimes forget they lied. They used the same lie in February about rising violence in Chinatown. They lied about tear gassing our youth last summer at the protests.  and inventing whole cloth, something about Molotov cocktails, which we know was bullshit. They lied about Joshua Pollock reaching for a gun when they murdered him in his sleep. They lied about a department-wide rape scandal just five years ago. And that's just the tip of the iceberg. These are epic, brazen, spectacular lies. So why would we ever believe anything that they say, especially when only 4% of their time is spent on responding to violence? Violence is not what they do, and it's not an excuse for more cops.  And so why should we believe a word that they say? The people of Oakland know better, and we're tired of this propaganda. This discourse sounds like the darkest days of the drug war, and we've had it. We're ready for something new. Thank you.",Police Reform

And so the reason that I'm here today is I'm here to urge you to adopt the city, the council's president's budget, because we need real investments in service rather than.  And then we need a real violence prevention program rather than spending all the tax dollars that the city has on police department. We've done that for many, many, many years. And as we all know, that hasn't worked for the city of Oakland. We need to fund departments. We need to fund the Department of Workplace and Employment Standards so that workers have the right to have respect and good jobs  And that'll help prevent violence in our community in the long run, rather than spending the money on funding more police.

I think appearances make a difference in how we as a community  look and how people perceive us, which means it looks as if we are here, but we're not here. We have excess homelessness. We have property owners that don't take care of their property. We've gone from homeowners to home renters, and the property owners don't make sure that those properties stay up to standards, which should be an appearance as far as  people wanting to come to our area, our core international boulevard looks like a slum.

Either we give them a blank check with zero accountability or they threaten that crime will increase.  Recently, a family member was looking at next door and someone was talking about their car being broken into. They said a police officer showed up at their house to investigate, but then told them there was nothing he could do because they were being defunded. Never mind that he was lying since they haven't been defunded yet at all. And I'm not accusing the cops in general of a conspiracy, but this is part of a larger issue. Our position as the only protection we have against crime.  At some point, we have to face the fact that policing has not solved crime. Claiming we need to keep the current police budget because it will keep our city safe is disingenuous because we obviously are not safe. That person's car was still broken into. The crime they say we need them to prevent is still there. What we need are real solutions, fighting the root of the problem, which is poverty and suffering. We can only get those solutions if we redistribute some of the police funding. The council president's budget proposal is a good first step. I beg you to be brave and to take it.

I live right around the corner from the shooting at the lake that occurred this weekend, and I could see the chaos ensue for my apartment. I know that every weekend there's heavy police presence at the lake, and I know that on Juneteenth, OPD had additional backup at the lake.  Still, the shooting was not prevented, and yet every time a tragedy like this happens in our town, the OPOA, Mayor Schaaf, and their allies in city council exploit the trauma in our communities to push for more police funding. The truth is the police can only respond to the violence, and they don't even do that well. The mother of DeShawn, the young Black man that was killed last weekend, wasn't even notified by the police that her son was deceased. She learned from a tweet.  I personally would never call the cops because the interactions I've had with cops have been filled with harassment and unnecessary intimidation. Maybe increased police presence at East Lake makes my white neighbors feel safe, but does not make me feel safe. And it probably doesn't make my black and brown neighbors feel safe either.  And I just want to uplift the findings by the Urban Peace Movement, where they surveyed Black men from Oakland, where 87% of the participants said that they also don't feel safe when OPD is in their community. Their top four ideas for increasing safety in Oakland were good paying jobs, violence prevention programs, affordable and stable housing, and addressing the root cause of poverty and violence.  While I believe a much larger divestment is needed from OPD, divestment, sorry, I'm here to support the budget proposal put forward by Council President Bass, my city council rep, and I want to thank her and Council Member Fife for all their work on this budget and for holding space at the lake on Tuesday for a community vigil. I also wholeheartedly reject Council Member Lauren Taylor's attempt to use federal COVID relief dollars to fund the Fifth Police Academy, which would be an increase from the status quo.  This is unacceptable. It's also offensive that the mayor is proposing to build a new $500 million police headquarters when we have so many people forgotten living on the streets. Our city has been overfunding the police for years.",Police Reform

I'm also an associate member of Allen Temple Baptist Church. First of all, thank you for the opportunity to speak. I'll leave the accolades for everyone else to distribute. I want to say that MACRO must be fully funded as a pilot 24 hour program in East Oakland so that it can be effectively evaluated  used to demonstrate that this community-initiated civilian alternative to 911 is more effective and cheaper than the traditional OPD. Trying to stretch the pilot to cover more of the town will nullify MACRO's success. We need to be sure that they are guaranteed a living wage, which is $70,000 a year. Someone in the council said, well, MTs make  so much money, but mackerels are not EMTs. And one other thing that struck me while everyone was speaking about this new academy class, all these police departments in California trying to certify the post requirement, what Oakland needs to do is partner up with one of these colleges. And instead of having an academy,  Integrate your academy into the college. Those who want to become a police officer can go to college and enroll in those courses. When they graduate from college, which is the academy with their degree amongst other type of courses, then they can be eligible to be an OPD officer. That's just an idea.  But if you're talking about reimagining police, that's the way to do it. And that's the way to save money. God bless each and every one of you.",Public Safety and Law Enforcement

I live three blocks from a Royal Park in District 6. So I'm deeply involved in my community.  What we need is jobs and job training, especially in deep East Oakland and in West Oakland. We need more city services in East Oakland to clean up our streets, to fix our streetlights, and to be more responsive to community needs. That's what actually prevents crime, not responds to crime, but prevents crime.  We also need affordable housing for our brothers and sisters that are living on the street margins and on the streets. 70% of them who are black. Our kids need robust summer camps and after school programs, and our young adults need more funding for summer jobs. Overall, that is what our city, how we can imagine safety.

You have not responded to the issue of the city of Emeryville, the city of Piedmont, not having appropriate contracts related to the library. You have had programs like the day labor program and the animal shelter for which you have not had any reports and you fund unconditionally.

I'm here in support of a People's Just Recovery budget that reinvests resources and accommodations for the unhoused community, creating more affordable housing, violence prevention, and other programs that actually keep us safe.  I support Council Member Bass's proposal to invest $17 million to the Department of Violence Prevention, including community ambassadors, and to fully fund MACRO as a response to nonviolent calls by shifting budget away from OBD patrols. The amendment, like Merritt, this past Juneteenth has demonstrated that no amount of police officers can prevent such incidents, even when there was increased police presence throughout the Lake Area on that day.  Every budget cycle, more funds have been granted to OPD, yet they have continued to overspend their budget, and yet violent crime continues to increase, and so has violence in other forms, like poverty is violence, hunger is violence, homelessness is violence. So I also urge the council to reject Council Member Taylor's proposal to use American Rescue Plan COVID-19 funds to pay for Fifth Police Academy. As someone said earlier, they have a low graduation rate, and it is unfair that we are  continue to front the cost of training cops or other cities. These funds need to be reinvested in the Permanent Affordability Fund to support the production of more affordable housing, purchasing the Lake Merritt Lodge to ensure that it can accommodate and have residents in the long run, purchasing the Travelers Hotel for the same purpose, Helens Prevention or other services that instead of an already bloated police budget, we need a budget that prioritizes safety instead of more violence, more police funding  and the consequence and strategic underspending of their departments and other solutions that have continued to fail.

They need jobs, housing, social services, and parks, not training new cops. I also want to add that police presence seems to have no connection to ending gun violence as we sadly saw this weekend. We demand that the city invests in housing so that we can offer Oaklanders the stability necessary for them to thrive rather than incarcerate them and police them as they struggle to live  Stable and affordable housing is what allows us to maintain relationships to family and friends to keep jobs to avoid the financial strain that ultimately can lead to violence.  We also know that the mayor plans to spend $500,000 to plan the development of a $500 million police headquarters. This is a huge waste of money. So many real problems could be solved with this money, and instead it is being used to fund something that the people of Oakland do not want and do not need. We demand that city council instead invest these resources in building acquisition fund that will ensure affordable housing for residents and rental spaces for small businesses.

I represent District 2, and I'm speaking today on behalf of the Oakland Youth Commission. Firstly, I'd like to thank Council for all that you do to improve the city of Oakland. But today, I'm here to remind you that youth have been waiting for too long, and we want reinvestments in us right now.  Given the countless hours of hard work, dedication, and positive impact OIAC has demonstrated, it would truly serve Oakland youth if we had an additional full-time staff who can empower us. Time and time again, OIAC has advocated for these reinvestments and we continue to be ignored. It feels like our work has been overlooked and I want you all to know what we have done.  Over the past two years, as documented in our annual report, the commission has hosted a COVID budget town hall and advocated for budget priorities benefiting Oakland youth, surveyed 400 youth for the Reimagining Public Safety Task Force Youth Advisory Board and made recommendations, hosted a youth candidates forum and endorsed Oakland youth votes, trained city staff on effective youth engagement, conducted anti-racism workshops, and helped establish a citywide youth incentive program in partnership with DoorDash.  I'd like to remind you that the Youth Commission is the largest commission in the city of Oakland, and that's great because we can do more and represent more youth voices. And next year, we aim to produce another youth strategic plan, plan a youth conference and concert, host multiple hearings on youth issues, pre-register youth to vote, and much more.  As I said, the work OYAC has done with its limited funding and support has already had a great impact on the city of Oakland, and allowing OYAC and other forms of youth leadership development to grow their capacity will only grow the extent of their positive impact. And if there's only one staff person, how are we supposed to develop our minds, emotions, and get support for the things we need and want to do? After years of this investment in us, it seems like you have really low expectations of us, and I'm here to remind you that by not funding investments in us,  You're contradicting your mission to serve Oakland by overworking staff and not actively serving us.",Education and Youth Services

I'm a rising senior at Oakland School for the Arts, and I have represented District 3 on the Oakland Youth Commission for the past few years. Thank you, Council, for your endless work every day to uplift, empower, and improve Oakland. The many cohorts that have embodied the Youth Commission have been present and advocating for youth issues through its advising role in the city for the past 35 years.  This year, OYAC has engaged with many community initiatives, and we want to express our support towards dedicating funding for transitional aged youth housing on 1025 2nd Avenue, the allocation of funds to hire a consultant to support creating a Department of Children and Family Services, and increased investment in the Department of Violence Prevention. In addition to that, OYAC supported and participated in drafting several of the recommendations as a part of the Reimagining Public Safety Task Force.  Specifically, we support recommendation 122, which would increase the investment in youth and youth leadership development.  Now regarding youth development, since OYAC's budget was cut down to one full-time staff person 15 years ago, those funding levels have never been restored, which adds a barrier to OYAC's engagement with youth from all over Oakland. To make big moves, to make meaningful changes, OYAC needs funding, and this is an equity issue. We only have one staff member who takes on additional work as it is,  which isn't fair to her and isn't fair to us because we have high expectations for ourselves. But the lack of funding shows that maybe we aren't pushed to reach for the stars by the city. As if as much as I want to research houselessness, make resolutions, host events, have dozens of projects, there apparently just isn't enough funding or this isn't an Oakland priority. Uplift us to reach new imaginable solutions I know you want here in Oakland and specifically within City Hall. But that means giving us more money.

I'm Tashawn Thomas, District 3 resident and public policy manager for the Oakland Chamber of Commerce, representing over 1,000 local and small businesses here in Oakland. Recently, all five Oakland chambers representing one Oakland submitted a letter to this body regarding our budget concerns.  We have been clear on creating a balanced budget which provides both funds, important community services, while maintaining our public safety. Our five chambers support the efforts to designate funding for three police academies in budget year one and create a policy directive  to determine ways to retain officers in the program and through field training. Without such maintenance due to officer transfers and attrition, the city will fall well below the current levels threatening community services and funding. We believe this is particularly important over the next year, while alternative programs such as MACRO, which we have supported and will continue to support, ramp up operations and train staff.  Once again, let me be perfectly clear. The business community has worked actively and supports community services which uplift many who have felt left out of the city's progress, including providing millions in homeless prevention programs and support for the bid formation fund  which will help emerging commercial districts throughout the city. But we also recognize that public safety is part of that community service and maintaining public safety is needed to address immediate concerns of businesses and residents. With the rising violent crime rate against businesses and residents, many have felt unsafe to walk our streets, enjoy the beauty of Oakland and patronize our local businesses.  This is taking a huge economic and personal toll on all of those who live, work, and play here. We implore council to ensure that your final decisions create an equitable and safe environment for residents and businesses to thrive and grow. Thank you.",Public Safety and Law Enforcement

Yesterday, I was at a Zoom meeting of jurisdictions throughout the United States and Canada that are creating alternative emergency response programs. I was asked about the elements of macro.  and the model that so many Oaklanders continue to advocate for. The other jurisdictions are always amazed when they hear about the macro model. Wow, we wish we could have incorporated those elements. How did Oakland do it?  Oakland's model is unique and sustainable because it was developed by and for Oaklanders. You've heard repeatedly from Oaklanders across neighborhoods and interests. I thank the person from the Chamber of Commerce who always mentions MACRO as something that they support. The support is near universal. And the support is for fully funding MACRO for success.  There has to be excellent pay and union representation for macro emergency responder jobs. It's essential to the success of the program. It's essential to prioritize hiring Oaklanders who can serve their own communities. The city has thus far been disinterested in engaging community members in the development of the pilot.

I'm calling to support the refund coalition's budget and also as a member of the Coalition for Police Accountability. We have a chance to begin the end of the cycle of violence, fear, retribution, and more violence now, and we must take that chance. We must fully fund MACRO and give it a chance to work, remembering that more will be expected of it than policing.  When policing fails to prevent or solve crimes, as it inevitably does, we respond by giving them more money, which so far has not worked out too well. I heard our DVP Chief Cespedes speak at the vigil at the lake, and he said we have the talent and the brains to find solutions to cure our terrible violence, and we do. Give his department enough funds to try.  Remember also to fund the parks like Montclair, where my grandson rides the swings, and Arroyo Viejo, where my son played Babe Ruth baseball, and the 88th Avenue mini park, the other ones that people spoke of. Not maintaining our parks is a slap in the face to the neighborhoods who depend upon them. It's the ultimate disrespect.  When it comes to police recruitment, we're clearly doing it wrong. Let the Department of Violence Prevention work with the police commission and our new chief to design a recruitment process that works. Our greatest tool for recruitment and retention will likely be bringing the department out of federal oversight. We may have a chance with this chief to do that. Don't let the opportunity that the horror of the plague and its aftermath has provided to do things differently.  Don't let that slip away. There is money for programs for our youth and will be more money for policing from the feds. There must also be funding to provide for our unhoused citizens to live in dignity.

Investing more funds into OPD for an additional police academy will not lead to improved public safety. And it was stated by a member of the command staff, I believe the assistant chief, that even at full staffing, that they may still have overtime issues. Let's also not forget that OPD is an organization that has failed for 18 years to resolve the tasks associated with the negotiated settlement agreement.  Why reward them with another academy? All the NSA is is a list of 51 best practices to improve the department. Nine of those 51 tasks are associated with achieving sustained cultural change. Yet of the eight tasks still out of compliance, six of those are related to achieving sustained cultural change. You have to ask yourself, why is it taking them 18 plus years to implement these best practices when other departments are able to resolve their consent decrees in two to five years?  Why indoctrinate more innocent probationary officers into a department that's unable to hold themselves to an appropriate standard and one that resists cultural change? Adding an additional academy is not a fact-based decision based on realistic safety outcomes. It just sounds like more hyperbole.  I also did a tour of the Bearcat and Suburban armored vehicles earlier this year, and the officers, who were their so-called subject matter experts, reported that the Suburban provided the same level of ballistic protection as the Bearcat paramilitary-style vehicle. Then one of them showed me a riot shield and told me that it provided ballistic protection for up to .50 caliber.  Both are completely false and ridiculous to even say, and I had to do research on my own to get to the truth. Mind you, this gear is intended to keep both officers and the public safe. However, if the so-called subject matter experts don't know the capabilities and limitations of their gear, how can we be positive that probationary officers that are trained by them are going to be taught the correct gear to use in public safety situations? On the other hand, applying the funds to the Department of Violence Prevention is already a best practice at work.  Let's invest more funds into them instead. That way we can get closer to solving some of the root causes of why we're having these public safety issues in the first place. Thank you very much.",Police Reform

I support items in these amendments like traffic calming, funding for the Brookdale Recreation Center and other parks, money for sidewalk cutouts for trees, the Laurel Business District restriping, City Hall East, additional money for neighborhood councils for community empowerment efforts.  I also support Council President Bass's proposal that would quadruple the money going to the Department of Violence Prevention. This is a proven strategy. I like this quote.

If you've not had a chance to read the hard work of the economists, data experts, financial auditors, community union organizers of this work group, here's a snapshot which will show you how adding police academies is fiscally irresponsible and does not tackle the shared desire of community to address violence. Some dollars and data points include sworn staff makes up more than 65% of the department's spending. The cost of a sworn position is 1.8 times the cost of non-sworn positions and is about 20% more than officers in similar cities.  It costs nearly $250,000 per officer to put them through the academy, more than three years at Harvard Law School. For every officer you allocate funds for an academy, you could pay nearly two people in a civilian department for a year. And according to who you ask, 75% to 96% of calls for service are about nonviolent issues. Even the police agree with 75%.  Our recommendations included reducing sworn staff and replacing with civilian staff and other departments. This way you reduce costs, but not resources. In fact, you can argue it increases ability to address nonviolent calls because the cost of an officer is 78% more than a civilian position. City Council removing duties currently held by police to civilian departments, for example, decriminalizing homelessness and removing police response to calls for animal control, mental health and traffic. There's plenty more.  We noted that in order to reach fiscal solvency and achieve the goal of a 50% cut, one of two things must happen. You must reduce the salary of OPD, which the union will never go for, or reduce sworn officers. In conclusion, it makes no financial sense, nor does it align with the needs based on the data for calls for service to add police. The current goal of 800 plus sworn officers is simply wrong, given what the dollars and data show.

Thanks everyone for working on this, you know, very complex and difficult issue where you're hearing from a lot of different people with different ideas. I just wanted to comment about our oversight process as the oversight committee for the Measure Q funds. At the end of last year, PRAC was made the oversight committee to oversee the spending of Measure Q funds.  And so far this first time, this first budget process has been difficult and rushed and confusing. Again, I know this is a complex process, but we wanna be a good transparent oversight committee for these funds, but it makes our job difficult when drafts come out late and we have to parse through long confusing documents to even find the funds that we're supposed to be overseeing. I hope that the next budget round, we can work through these issues and have a smoother oversight and budget process for the spending of measure Q funds.  For a couple of items for Measure Q specifically, Measure Q has a legislation that details how these funds can be spent and used. But through this process, we haven't seen that that legislation has been followed on numerous various budget proposals. We've seen proposals for too much administrative time, for hiring positions that aren't allowed by Measure Q. And perhaps the biggest issue is what to do with carryover funds from last year, unspent funds, or extra funds that have come in because the funds coming in are higher than projected.  Those funds need to stay with Public Works and they need to be used to meet Measure Q's goals in improving parks and providing services for homelessness and not using the other ways that we've seen throughout this budget proposal process. This budget proposal process has felt like our oversight role has been  us trying to hold the city accountable to the legislation as written, reacting to the proposals rather than how we envision our oversight role, which will hopefully be providing a good, transparent, proactive direction to the spending of these funds in the future.

How dare you even talk about spending millions on new buildings and renovations instead of housing for people living on their streets?  Stop inflicting trauma. Let the cops have a bake sale. Shaft's budget is based on 32 officers coming out of each academy. Per the city data, each academy and field training takes nine months, costs $3.8 million, and on average trains 38 recruits, yielding only 17 who actually become officers. Not 32, 17. This is before you talk about the OPD stated attrition rate of five officers a month,  which is 45 officers leaving over the course for the academy. Shaft's plan is based on math that doesn't work. The task force guiding principles on accountability include the task force members must move as a collective unit, not individuals with personal agendas. I have concerns that Council Member Taylor, despite being one of the co-chairs of the task force, has at times functioned as an individual and the mayor's laptop.  He's talked about much of the task force being in favor of not making any changes to policing until we have something proven effective and running in its place.

There is a housing crisis in Oakland, and the city must act to end it. That's why EBO and the Refund Coalition are calling on council members to prioritize housing, job training, and public safety that focus on violence prevention.  Now, if the city were to allocate $40 million to affordable housing productions, we can create up to 700 new affordable units in the city of Oakland. The mayor's proposed budget would only create a fraction of that. Imagine what good 700 affordable units would do to give long-suffering families and individuals like mine the safety and security of an affordable and dignified place to call home. Housing is a human right and we must prioritize it.  The residents of the city of Oakland demand that we do. The mayor's budget simply does not prioritize housing for Oaklanders.

In planning the way forward, many of us here believe that defunding the police will make our city safer. They are here to make certain that new programs and established community groups which have long been languishing for funds are incorporated into this new reimagining public safety budget.  We all want justice and safety in our communities. But defunding, is it really the way to go when we are seeing enormous spikes in violent crime? So far in 2021, the Oakland homicide rate has surged by over 300%. Now is not the time to try experimental approaches at the expense of policing. Defunding has already been tested in several cities around the US for the past few years, always with disastrous consequences.  Funding community services is an urgent unmet need, and there can be little question that such investments can have great benefits. But these benefits are generally gradual and cumulative. They cannot meet the urgent, immediate needs of those people in our poorest and most vulnerable communities to be safe in and around their neighborhoods.  We need the people we need to take the people who are responsible for this reign of terror off our streets now before they kill again. I worry that if we do not support the police in their efforts to rein in the dangerous elements in our communities, violent crime will explode, as it has in every city in which defunding programs have been instituted.  putting many more innocent people in danger.

I'm a resident of District 6, and I'm calling in to support Reed Tau Taylor Amendment because it acknowledges that we must continue keeping our residents safe while we reallocate our funds. I continue to be concerned about the level of violence, especially in East Oakland, and we must realize that we're living in an anomaly of a year, and we therefore need to consider that.  This was any other year, and things had remained constant. I'd express full support for our reallocation of resources, but this is different. We're coming out of an economy that has been wrecked by the pandemic, and thus a resulting increase in crime. And mayors across the country, Austin, Seattle, Atlanta, DC, are facing this issue as well. The narrative people talk about is real in East Oakland. We hear gunshots nightly. We see people getting robbed and carjacked daily.  and a 12-year-old shot as thieves steal from their home. I realize that more cops doesn't solve that, but we also need to be aware that we're sending a message that in Oakland, we can't respond adequately to crime and therefore you can do that without consequence. And these alternative programs that we talk about, as much as I agree with them, they need time to ramp up. And I've heard nothing about how we plan to continue keeping Oaklanders safe, especially in East Oakland. We need to acknowledge that OPD is understaffed  And therefore impacting its recruiting abilities only furthers our reliance on the overtime that's dangerous. And what it ultimately does is put our most vulnerable communities at risk. I want to say that SF does have a non-police program like MACRO, but they also have a fully staffed police department.  And I think that you need both working together. We need to ensure that our police not stop, that we don't rely on dangerous overtime.

Well, there has been some progress made. The fifth Q&A did establish that they reallocated the funding that was in the encampment management into the homeless portion of Measure Q. So that was excellent. And the supervisor too that was put into Measure Q has been moved into a different fund.  However, the overall issue with Measure Q is that there is $4 million of new ongoing revenue in parcel tax money  And only three, and I think three positions being added in the parks area with that money to do custodial work, custodial blitzes, which is excellent. But the purpose of Measure Q was to do ongoing increases in public service to every park and landscape area in the city. And what's happening is that it's either in projects that are one-time expenditures  which is, or overtime. So, you know, I hope that going into the mid cycle and into the next two years, there can be a much better process for involving the community, your advisory commissions. I haven't seen either of their recommendations come forward to council, either the PrEP or the homeless commission.  and that the community has much higher level of engagement. Now, one other issue is the Union Point Park. That is still seemingly in the Measure Q funding. It is a major capital project. It does not qualify for Measure Q funding. It needs to be funded somewhere else. The mandate for that has been pending for over two years. The city needs to find KK money or other funding to pay for that funding.  and move forward with the capital projects, the minor capital projects that the council's put together, which seem to be okay, but this one Union Point Park does not seem equitable.",Governance and Civic Engagement

Personally, I think if this and previous councils were serious about the ubiquitous rhetoric of OPD having less of a footprint, where it's not having an impact on serious crime,  while guaranteeing those who most needed a responsive public safety system they can believe in with police focused on violent crime, there would have been an even bigger boost to macro and budget reallocations and a credible commitment to those macro jobs as highly valued jobs. It's a program with deep research and community engagement done over a year ago that is for real in changing the terrain of policing and it has the broadest possible public support.  That opinion offered, I'll put on my faith in action East Bay hat and make three explicit points that we stand by. First, make sure all jobs created in shifting public safety strategies away from OPD like macro be highly valued skilled jobs at $70,000 a year plus benefits so Oaklanders with the relevant experience can afford to stay in Oakland.  Second, direct the city through the fire department to do authentic community engagement in setting up the macro model, starting in East Oakland with folks working on the ground like frontline healers and others who actually have an ongoing presence in the impacted communities. Third, set up the East Oakland pilot as a 24-7 operation, three shifts, so it can be effectively modeled and the data can be drawn for necessary expansion in the second year.

I'm really sad to hear about the increasing violence in Oakland, but like so many other people on this call, I don't actually believe that police prevent violence. In small, very controlled studies, it's been shown that having a few people, a few extra people on street corners where violence is common can reduce violence, but that is...  That's a small and sort of isolated special circumstance, and it does not translate to more money in the police leads to less violence. I'd like to reiterate what everyone has said, that violence is not just guns. It's people not being able to pay their rent. It's people falling into poverty.

Some of the previous commenters have said that none of us want more police in Oakland. I wish that were true, but as everybody who's been listening knows, a lot of people here feel that more police will help reduce the amount of gun violence that the city is seeing.  And I'm disappointed that my council person and others are trying to make compromises to satisfy those who hold that belief, instead of exercising the leadership to show them that doing more of what doesn't work isn't going to help. Others have referred to Chief Armstrong's comments. Yesterday, the Washington Post  had a story about how in dozens of cities across the country for the last year or so, gun violence has been increasing. It has nothing to do with the differential level of staffing in different cities. It's happening everywhere regardless of the level of staffing. And they quoted the police chief of Fort Worth as saying, we're not going to arrest our way out of this.  In 1976, Robert de Gracia, Boston police commissioner, said, we're not letting the public in on our era's dirty little secret, that those who commit the crime which worries citizens most, violent street crime, are for the most part products of poverty, unemployment, broken homes, and goes on, about which the police can do little of anything.  And to wrap up, I just want to mention, I know this from personal experience. In 2009, I was shot by somebody trying to rob me on the street while a police officer was parked in his patrol car a block away. He could hear the shot, but there was nothing he could do. And people don't commit crimes in front of the police. If there's a patrol car going by, they're going to wait until it goes by.

I'm also a proud member of SEIU 10 to 1, and I speak in very strong support of President Council Bass's and the team, the posse that you've had from the budget team, Council Member Fife,  And the reason I speak strongly in support of that is when I found out about the $600 million proposal for the two-year term for the police department, I was stunned. I was outraged. And I couldn't believe that the mayor wants to build a whole new building. To do what?  And in that regard, I'm hopeful and inspired by the council's direction to move into another realm of how we deal with the issue of violence and lack of public safety in our community. With that, I think addressing the violence is by  making sure that we have programs we can really lift up, get our youth to work, get our young people to work in the community so that we as a community can protect our own. I also wanna mention, I'm really pleased to hear  the youth that have had their voices all throughout this process. You are our future. And, you know, someday maybe some of you may run for elected office. We need shared values. We need a collective plan and we need collective action. Thank you.",Governance and Civic Engagement

I'm the director of Faith Alliance for a More Economy, a D3 resident, a father, and a person impacted by the criminal and justice system. I forward to each of you a moral budget platform where FAME and Interfaith Movement for Human Integrity engage our diverse community of faith leaders on public safety. So I'm also speaking on their behalf today. I thank Council President Nikki Poitinano-Vas and Council Member Faya Fagalo and Cobb,  for your purposeful and meaningful moral leadership, holding that a budget is a blueprint of our values and centering those most impacted in our communities. I thank the council for upholding the Department of Work-Related Employment Standards and funding positions to support it that will ensure worker protections. Having a good job and being protected in that job is a public safety issue.  Thank you, Council President Voss and Council Member Fife. From the bottom of my heart, I thank you for your visual at the lake, which included Passage for Peace to address the impact of violence and suffering on the family. The family who neither the mayor nor the police chief offered condolences or respite. It's a shame that a child lost his life and the police made him the cause of slanders and lies.  We are witnessing what trusted officials look like today. Make no mistake that this is about the future of our children, and I want to make a few simple points clear. First, the police do not equal public safety. An investment in more academies equates continued investment in a bottomless pit designed to suck the resources out of our communities, designed to further subjugate Black people to predatory nature of slavery. Let's not be mistaken. The job of the police is to capture and subdue and not to heal or make...  whole historical inequities enforced by the police. Secondly, a healthy and thriving community is one that prioritizes resources to meet the needs of our children and provide them with a future, provide pathways to adjust the economy of stable employment and healthy community by addressing mental health issues. Thank you again, council members, for your advised amendments to the budget. We support you 100%.",Public Safety and Law Enforcement

I'm a member of Faith in Action East Bay and of Imani Community Church. I'm proud to be a part of Oakland where our budget is being drafted to reflect a just and equitable recovery. However I do have concerns. I have not heard any council members state that they believe that macro jobs must be well paid. The city has been willing to pay high salaries for police officers  to respond to emergency calls that will now be answered by macro responders. Does the work lose its value? I've not heard any council members state that they believe that the city must prioritize hiring people with deep connections and understanding of the challenges in the neighborhoods that they serve. I have not seen any council member take action  to support good jobs that are filled with impacted black and brown Oaklanders. I have not seen any council members take any action to demand that the city engage Oaklanders and the planning for the macro pilot in their own neighborhood. I'm calling to ask you directly not to let us down. If you're truly progressive, you will ensure that the black and brown people of Oakland are hired for the macro program and trained to replace some of our police.  you will fight to ensure that they are paid a wage of at least 70,000 a year with benefits so that they will be able to remain in our community and to raise their families here. These are emergency responder jobs, not comparable to nine to five jobs with less responsibility, stress, or potential risk. If you don't make sure that these jobs are paid what they're worth, not only are you likely to doom the macro program to death by attrition,  But you're betraying your progressive credentials and your promises of a just and equitable recovery. I want to thank the community and the many community members and organizations who researched and organized and advocated and developed the macro model as it is before you now. I am proud that my organization was.",Governance and Civic Engagement

I'm also a social justice minister in the East Bay and a faith-rooted organizer with Faith Alliance for a More Economy, FAME. We are an initiative of the East Bay Alliance for a More Economy, EBASE.  We joined the interfaith movement for human integrity and created a faith delegation around the budget. So my voice represents 140 faith leaders and 28 faith institutions whose hearts are shattering every time a bullet stills a soul. So we are delegation committed ourselves more deeply and more actively to ending racial and economic violence. So today I'm urging  the city council to pass a more budget, which reflects the values that addresses the suffering of all of Oakland. We are calling on the council, the mayor, and the city administrator to support our council president's budget and her team that prioritizes housing, job training, public safety, that focuses on finally investing in violence prevention and emergency mental health services. We're calling on city council to reject the Taylor Amendment  COVID-9 relief dollars should not be spent on training law enforcement. It should be spent helping Oaklanders recovered from COVID-19. You see, we are not asking for a budget proposal written by those touting Black Lives Matter while stripping away a Black and Brown workforce and what that means to supporting positions for the Department of Workplace Employment. We're not asking for a budget for those who  are saying that housing is a human right. Yep, is absent of any real promise of change.

I'm the President and CEO of the Oakland African-American Chamber of Commerce and founding president of the Oakland Bay Area Chapter. I'm here to express my support for the budget amendments proposed by council members Taylor, Chau, and Reed.  I also support Taylor's win-win solution and amendment to prioritize funding for a fifth police academy without any reduction to the transformative investment Oakland needs to reimagine public safety, including a record 20 plus million dollar investment in violence provision, full funding of a 24 seven macro pilot in East Oakland and many other recommendations from the reimagining public safety tax for.  Without the Fifth Police Academy that Taylor has proposed, Oakland's police force will shrink faster than the alternatives can be put in place to offload the work. This will lead to longer wait time for 911 responses if they respond at all. And this will disproportionately impact Black people who are responsible for the majority of the 911 calls for service.  The initial draft budget amendment proposed by council president's budget team was a good first step, but doesn't do enough when it comes to addressing the long-term systemic inequities that have plagued central and deep East Oakland for decades.  Taylor Tau Reed's amendment address gaps that will help to ensure the safety, health and financial stability of even more Oaklanders, including the most vulnerable.

Black Homeless Advocate Lake Merritt, also Executive Director of the Green Team. I'd like to once again reiterate the fact that bathrooms in parks are a public safety issue, especially when you have kids that are leaving the park and going all the way back home when their parents think they're at the park.  Going back to and fro from a park to the bathroom is not a good idea. Using the bathroom in the bushes while you have adults around, when you have children, that's not a good idea. Let's make sure that all bathrooms in all communities, especially in the black communities, if we're going to be spending park money, Mr. Riley, from the commission, let's don't spend it on repaving tennis courts because those aren't used by black people for the most part anyway.  Let's take care of these bathrooms so the kids have a place to play. And that'll cut down on some of the violence. Let's make sure that we have something for our kids to do.  Also, just quickly, I'd like to say, Mr. Ed Riskin, you do know me. We know each other. I worked not directly under you, but I have worked for you and you know how efficient I can be.

It's hidden in the fine language, but item number five about the funding and identifying staff to acquire buildings  and to use money, city money up to $12 million to acquire buildings for the land trust, et cetera. TOPA is an extremely significant policy that affects the entire city. And we have requested for over a year to engage the city  on important critical policy and we've been denied the whole rollout of TOPA has been extremely dubious, disappointing, and it's extremely upsetting and  This has huge impacts and I want to know what the city will do going forward to engage us as a public so that we could have true and genuine input on this TOPA policy. I feel like what is done is wrong. The public has been denied appropriate outreach and Berkeley is putting TOPA on hold because  It sees that the land trust was given $12 million. That home that was acquired that was supposed to house homeless people is still vacant after a year. And the policy in TOPA in Berkeley is raising rents on tenants. There are exemptions there that allow  a 40% rent increase in tenants in just five years. That is wrong. Please stand up for homeowners, local residents, and tenants so that we are taken care of.

I know that they have already used your powers to have money allocated to certain entities that should have been in the budget, like the day labor program, Central De La Rasta getting money. I know that Cobb is going to be coming with this initiative to get a library at Piedmont instead of keeping it as a child development center, because you meet behind closed doors to do things that don't result in equity.  The day labor program is racist and you need to develop an equitable program for other people. You have a Lake Merritt initiative for which you funded over $500,000 using money from the warriors. Now you're looking at another $693,000 for Lake Merritt in addition to another $263,000 for public works addition at Lake Merritt.  You're spending all this money at Lake Merritt and Taylor and Reed can't get money for this violent crime that's going on in East Oakland. And look at them, it's millions of dollars now that you put into Lake Merritt. And you are talking about parking and you're talking about noise and white folks don't want these black people on the lake. You have grants that you give to the same people over and over again.  That's why I can't see how you're going to hold the police accountable when you don't hold the unity council accountable for taking that money in 2015. When you don't hold the open promise accountable, they owe us $4 million and you keep giving them money. You give money to central dealer roster and they can't help black people as it relates to rent and eviction.

First and foremost, I do want to say that I do not in any way support the four new police academies. We need those funds to be invested into the community. More specifically, community organizations like Homies Empowerment, Courage, and Vertical Skills.  At Homies, our hearts are set on helping and healing the hood. As a community care manager, I keep my heart, ears, and arms open to the needs of the people.  Homies Empowerment is currently set to open a community care center in Argus, where our five-person community care team will continue to help community members with access to resources, life skills, emotional and spiritual support.

We also launched Radio Balam, which is an online radio station that features local news, music, community conversations, all in mum, which is an indigenous language.  I am here to ask for funds to support Homies Empowerment and other community-based organizations. Our community does not need more police funding. We need funding for the people.

I want to start by thanking everyone for all your hard work. I know there's so much that goes into this, and I do want to make a few quick points. First, I want to begin by affirming the leadership of Councilmember Strieber-Reed, Lauren Taylor,  Chang Tao and Noel Gallo. And I'm doing this for a reason, because we hear lots of buzzwords like equity and racial justice. But East Oakland and deep East Oakland has not received equitable treatment, let alone funding.  And I really will encourage people. I've been out of state for the last two months. And I'm going to tell you, you really can't see the conditions in Oakland until you leave it for at least a week. So much that's going on has been so normalized that it doesn't even become a priority. We're dealing with a plethora of things out there in Oakland. And as it relates to resources, I want to make this point clear. I think we need to center the resources within our communities.  These are long-term residents who hold institutional memory. We had an opportunity to address gun violence last year when folks like myself and others raised it. We've seen it coming, but it was ignored. People didn't want to have that conversation. So now here we are, 60 homicides in, which is higher than last year, and we're now just having conversations about it.  There are real solutions, and it starts with centering the people who are in proximity to the folks in our community who leverage their connections and networks in a manner to really keep us safe. You know, I'm all about semantics, but I'm not about flowery language that make us feel good. You know, we've got to stop saying things that sounds good and really focus on how we can make Oakland a better place because this opportunity is to do so.  But we won't get there if we continue to be reactive. We have to stop letting disaster happen and then try to figure our way out of it. Let's find a way to stop falling into that same hole over and over again. And with that being said, I wish all of you well.",General Community Organizing

As I feel we are simply trying to work towards the concepts of hope, peace, inclusivity, and a more open, better reason, democratic community future, a reminder ELI, VLI, and mixed income can be more comprehensive ideas of affordable housing. I hope we can begin to work towards these good reimagined concepts now. The idealistic good preparation we can do now can simply make for our better human practices and can ensure a better future.  and that I also feel can make for an easier transition process and to more quickly better return to our regular practices and patterns for many large natural disasters the Bay Area may face in the next few years and decade. I hope simple open conversation, dialogue, and trust can be the good work to address all parts of the community and this in-between era of COVID-19 and violence we are in, and that can invite all sides to add to a better community local government process in our future.  Thank you. With my remaining time, I wanted to mention the city administrator. He offered a real grim, dour report to the incredibly hard work people are trying to do towards reimagining equity ideas at this time. I think if we talk more about natural disaster preparedness, we can talk about health and human services ideas and good practices of equity.  important ideas of equity. So the city of San Jose, they've worked incredible plans pre-COVID-19 about, we all were on the West Coast, about ideas of equity and reimagine. Let's do those things now. Let's do good audit reports. Let's get it together.",Governance and Civic Engagement

We've had that all our lives. We don't need to continue that. This was a very difficult process. And I think we can get there. We can be united.  You know, I thank folks for their input and all the hard work that they put into this. But let's do it in a united way instead of polarizing it and being more negative.

Yes, David Wofford, Oakland native, an ambassador and history guide with the Oakland Museum, a member of the Measure DD Coalition, Lake Neighbors, East Lake Neighbors, the Cleveland Heights Neighborhood Council, but most significantly, co-chair of the Rotary Nature Center Friends, primary stewards of the wildlife refuge at Lake Mary. I came here today in strong support of Council President Bastis and the budget team's recommendations. I want to say,  that in 1870, an all-white, all-male legislature of the state of California declared Lake Merritt a protected land for wildlife. It's a new day in America, a history that's been years in the making. We stand on the shoulders of those that came before us. The Rotary Nature Center Friends use Lake Merritt to increase our collective knowledge and understanding of our ecosystem. As stewards, we seek to understand how the past and present are shaping Bay Area communities for the future.  But the question before us now is how we can stop the oppression of specific groups of people, which is fundamental to our system's framework and design. Individuals, families, and communities here in Oakland have long suffered and experienced many forms of degradation to their quality of life, be it violent or otherwise. This does not excuse anyone's behavior, but it does mean that as citizens in the city, we have a mutual obligation and responsibility to address historical and systemic inequities.  The same systemic forces that have shaped our treatment of African-American people have shaped our treatment of the environment. Racism, sexism, and oppression are so intertwined with the nature and structure of our society that it is impossible to quit any of them without making fundamental structural changes throughout our system. The answer to the question of safety is not enforcement. It's access to safe, adequate housing, food, and healthcare, and investment capital, and to equal justice under the law.

But they, unfortunately today, the budget memorandum, the budget policy directive, specifically item five,  was published less than three days prior to this meeting. That's not open and transparent, and it should not have been included. And I'm sorry that, you know, Council Member Batt or Bass decided to include that and  We know that the city of Berkeley is going through a similar process right now. They found that there was many flaws in the process. Number one was there was no equity study. And they understand how these type of initiatives, TOPA by another name, actually hurts black and brown people, specifically in East Oakland. It pushes out owners. It hurts generational wealth. And for Nikki Bass to be pushing that,  without proper public notice is disheartening, actually. I think also, number six, the rent adjustment increase, the rent registry, these are not the right things to be doing. They are just going to be causing divisiveness in the community.

When the community has spoken time and time again, you've heard it today, you've heard it in every budget forum that you've been a part of,  What we need is actual solutions to violence in our city.

He said, you got money for wars, but you can't feed the poor.  If you guys build that new building for these police officers, for these brutal police officers that show us no love, no compassion, they treat us like animals. I'm a first-hand victim of this since I was 14, 15 years old, walking around being brown-skinned Latino, wearing too much of a bigger clothes than what I wear because I got hand-me-downs and automatically assumed that I'm a gang member. And I went through this my whole childhood. And it was programs like Homies in Empowerment that, thank God,  They came into my life when I was in high school, saved my life, gave me an opportunity to become a man, to be a person that's born and raised in Oakland, being proud of Oakland.  And it's just, I feel like it's so disrespectful for anybody to think that the police does anything in here besides makes the problem worse. You're funding the war. The war is here. The war is here in Oakland between the people that are suffering, that are trying to get out of here, trying to make a better living for themselves, besides these people that come into our city to patrol us when they're supposed to be here being safe. So therefore saying, I feel like money can be used in so many different ways in so many different situations, but  Nobody's getting to the root cause of why all this violence is happening. Who's showing those people who are out there doing that violence love? Who took care of them? Who nurtured them? Nobody. And that's what you get when you come to homeless. You get love. You get nourishment. You get a place of belonging. You feel like there's better than just that gun, that crack, that dope, that heroin you're selling on the corner. So I...  I just feel like funding could go in a million different ways to help a million different places. But you got to start with love. And that's what you get when you come to Homies.

I'm a lifelong Oakland resident, born and raised, and I'm the executive director of Urban Peace Movement. We appreciate the leadership of Council President Bass and members Feist, Kalb, and Gayo for moving toward a progressive budget.  This is Oakland, a place that's always been on the cutting edge of social and racial justice, and we need to continue to uphold these values. Earlier this year, as some other people stated, our organization surveyed in about four weeks over 240 Black men from Oakland, nearly three quarters of whom were from East Oakland. 87% of respondents of that survey said they feel less safe when they see police in their community.  They also stated that violence prevention programs, affordable, stable housing, and higher paying jobs address the root causes of violence and are the best ways to make them feel safe. We support the proposal to invest $17 million in community-based violence prevention programs, and we want to see increased investments in services and housing,  and especially that of housing and services for youth and young adults. And we asked the council to reject the proposal to increase the police budget to spend $500 million on a new OPD headquarters and to increase and use COVID funding for police academies.  Our communities in Oakland are over-policed, over-incarcerated, and at the same time underserved and under-protected. We need to invest in things that create real safety in our communities, things that quote-unquote safe communities already have, like housing, good jobs, quality education, parks.  Because those are the things in the neighborhoods where people think are safe neighborhoods. Those are the things those neighborhoods already have. There's a real double standard when people say that they have to have all of these rubrics and metrics for community-based programs, but when policing does not show to improve safety.",General Community Organizing

I'm systems impacted because my family and I have been directly impacted by policing. We're also impacted by mental and behavioral health and have first at hand seen the lack of health and services from OPD. But we have seen how much this budget will spend on officers that do nothing but incarcerate our BIPOC community members. The times the police interfered in my life, they only made the situation worse. They never helped.  The Alameda County City of Oakland budget shows that us BIPOC humans don't matter. They are funding the same officers who incarcerate and kill our Black and brown community members. Having been in these systems, I know that almost everyone incarcerated has experienced police brutality, whether physical, sexual, or emotional, and that separating families through incarceration is police terror. What we want is solutions that keep us safe.  Things like non-police responses to mental health services like MH First. We want community-based solutions like my fellowship at Courage. More young folk that are systems impacted like myself so they may obtain the skills they need to give back to their community by putting in the work. I'm helping other systems impacted young people from my community reach their goals as Courage and other communities united for restorative youth justice work have taught me.

It is disgraceful to me that council is considering amendments that would increase police funding instead of putting more resources into housing while so many of us are still struggling, while many of our residents have no way to actually afford housing. We are in an unprecedented housing crisis. We are in an unprecedented joblessness crisis. And it is not a surprise to me that violence would increase when our residents' needs  have been chronically unmet by capitalism, have been chronically unmet by neoliberalism.

I'm also concerned that people keep trying to change it into some idea that they have.  for some program. I wanna stick to the basics, keep macro the way it was designed by Oaklanders. In particular, it should have people from the community who are trained in deescalation, who are trusted by the community. I'm really concerned about adding requirements for the people who work in it, such as being a clinical nurse or something, a mental health worker,  because they don't want to go out without police.",Public Safety and Law Enforcement

I have a general concern first that the city council is gutting traffic safety via OPD but leaving nothing meaningful in its place.  that will help impacted streets city-wise. It appears to be a free-for-all in the speed limits people are driving out there, or the speeds rather. We agree that Oak Dot should be doing more, but they seem to only be working on Telegraph Avenue. As has recently been highlighted in the Chronicle  A devoted Glenview Elementary School African American father was killed on Middle Park Boulevard. A son is left without a dad permanently.

As there are several items related to budget issues today, thank you again, Oakland City Council, for all of your good effort and a clear good reasoning there can be with budget issues for the next few years. A reminder, good accounting and auditing can very much help good equity and reimagine ideas at this time and can be interesting ways to mend fences and help develop a more unified community process.  With the Narcotics Task Force agenda item to again try to make clear, we simply have to begin to better address the role of state violence and extremism as it creates despondency and exacerbates and continues the spiral of violence upon everyday local community and youth. With this said, the $5 million Complete Streets project on Telegraph Avenue sounds like it's going to have a lot of surveillance and data collection technology, a reminder that equity, reimagine, and open public policy ideas with technology  are a part of many current concepts that can actually help develop a more hopeful future of open democracy, a more open, communicative process for a community. The ideas of a positive community sustainability and ideas of peace, not war. On today's agenda, there are also some good subsidy programs coming into the Bay Area from the state and federal level and to help fund permanent housing from decades old problems where most low income homeless can only pay for short term transitional housing.  I hope these types of subsidy programs can stay true to the spirit of what they are intended to work towards and to not become corporate welfare programs meant to only feed the Bay Area real estate market. And finally, at about $300 an hour for each language, it should be important to ask ourselves in Zoom, why exactly is the cost of sharing a language with its community so high and exclusive?

I am a member of the Oakland Redistricting Commission. The commission is an unbiased and diverse team of citizens of Oakland, and we are charged with creating a map of new boundaries of the seven voting districts of Oakland by December 31st of 2021.  In order to create this map, we need input from the people of Oakland. We need to know what your communities of interest are. A community of interest is a concentrated population which shares common social and economic interests that should be included within a single district for purposes of its effective and fair representation.  If a particular community of interest is mapped to one district, this group as a community has more sway to elect representatives to the city council and the school board who speak to and act in the best interests of each community of interest. Examples include areas where people share similar living standards, have similar cultures, use the same transportation facilities, have similar work opportunities, or have access to the same media. Please consider what your communities of interest might be.  In order to share your community of interest with the Oakland Redistricting Commission, we need you to go to our website, which is www.oaklandca.gov slash redistricting, and click on the green rectangle that says, we want to hear from you.

Prioritize hiring people with lived experience in neighborhoods impacted by policing and violence so they know what the deal is when they go out there.  We ask that macro implementation involve community voices and leaders consistently in neighborhoods as it's being piloted in those neighborhoods and throughout the city as the model expands. Digital surveys are okay, but they're not nearly enough and they're not really meaningful community engagement.  And we ask that council members advocate for transparency in implementation and for true grassroots community involvement in the most affected neighborhoods to ensure that this pilot succeeds.

Dale Gerringer here with California Normal and one of the proponents of Oakland's Measure Z cannabis ordinance and a former member of the City Cannabis Commission. I want to commend Vice Mayor Kaplan and Council Member Fife for their resolution item 2.2 against discriminatory drug testing  of Assemblyman Quirk's bill to put an end to this. I think these drug tests have nothing to do with impairment, really. It's a fraud. I think, as we saw with this Sha'Carri Richardson incident in the Olympics, a positive drug test has nothing to do  in the case of marijuana. They're detecting not any active element of the drug, but inactive residues that stick around for days and weeks afterwards. It's time to end this obsolescent technology now that cannabis is legal here. I do want to say California has been behind bars  behind on this. Other states, including Nevada, Connecticut, New York, and New Jersey, actually have legislation barring this use of this kind of drug testing, and so have the cities of Atlanta, New York, Washington, D.C., and Philadelphia.

I'm calling in to ask you to please vote yes on allowing our group to begin formal negotiations with the JPA. We're excited to bring the WNBA to Oakland through what will be the country's first African American women-led ownership group.  We've been working very closely with the WNBA for over a year. We're in direct communication with the COO of the WNBA. We were assigned to her by the commissioner. It's really important to know that we're in high-level talks with this league. The strength of Oakland is really working in our favor, and Oakland itself is working in our favor with respect to the WNBA. We do know that there are other areas, San Francisco and Santa Clara,  that have expressed an interest in WNBA. So we feel that Oakland is the best place. The arena, the transportation with BART, with Amtrak, with 880, we just feel like we're in a great position. And also the WNBA, you know, their platform aligns with Oakland. Oakland is the epicenter of social justice and the WNBA led the sports leagues with respect to social justice this summer. Our ownership group will be some of the most dynamic African-American businesswomen in the country.  We're top-level negotiations with one of the most successful women's basketball players in history. Approving this will really give us an opportunity to put together the final piece of our proposal, which is designing an accurate financial analysis to complete our proposal. So we're fighting for Oakland. We know that San Francisco does not have territorial rights to the WNBA, but they do have a right to submit a competing proposal. So we need to move forward quickly, and we need to move forward with Oakland in our forefront.  This will strengthen our arena. We love our arena. It's a jewel of our community. We do everything from go to concerts to have Disney on ice there. And 2850, the local union has committed and we've committed to an agreement to create union jobs and continue that process.

I'm calling to urge you to approve the WNBA proposal item by the AASG. It's important to reflect on the fact that even though on the surface, this item is about the sport of basketball. In reality, this item is about far more than sports. When Jackie Robinson took his first at bat for the Brooklyn Dodgers, that moment was far bigger than the sport of baseball.  Likewise, this item that you're going to vote on today is actually a Jackie Robinson moment for Black women and Black girls. There are currently zero. I'm going to say that again. There are currently zero Black women who are the principal owners of a professional sports team in America. In this country, there's been an invisible wall that has literally told Black women that they aren't good enough, they aren't smart enough, they aren't capable of being the owners of a professional sports team.  Well, today we can shatter this wall once and for all. I'm sure almost all of us present here today have at some point during the last year raised our voices in support of the families of Breonna Taylor, Sandra Bland, and countless other Black women who our society failed to adequately uplift and protect while they were here. Well, today we have the opportunity to send the message that in Oakland, we do uplift, honor, and treasure Black women and Black girls, and that they truly can be anything that they set out to be.  The entire country is watching what Oakland does at this moment in history. So we must vote yes to approve this resolution of a term sheet for a Black woman-owned WNBA team that is being brought forth by the AASEG. I don't see how there can be any other conclusion and decision that is made by you all today. So thank you very much for your time. Have a great day.",Economic Development

My name is Karenia Bass, and I am the Chief of Staff at the Unity Council.  a community development corporation deeply rooted at East Oakland's Fruitvale neighborhood. I am here to speak regarding a few items tonight. So one, number 18, OWDB, Budget and Service Provider Contract Recommendations. We notice on attachment A that the Unity Council is the only organization not receiving general fund dollars for neither youth nor adult services.  It would be helpful to know when this item is read and understand how that decision was made and when it was made. As you know, the Unity Council has been a critical pillar of Oakland's workforce development system for decades. We currently serve over 300 residents from diverse backgrounds, including Latino, Black, Asian, Middle Eastern, and mixed race. Item number 17, accepting and appropriating $19.6 million in IRAF dollars  I cannot stress enough how the need is in the community. We currently have close to 700 Oaklanders on our wait list waiting for housing support. The report states that the city will work with community partners to get the message out. I want to put a plug in for the Resilient Fruitvale Collaborative, a group of 17 community-based organizations in East Oakland that include Tribe, Street Level, East Oakland Collective, and others.  that are ready to get the word out and really get the support that's needed to our community. Finally, I want to speak in support of item number five, the resolution amending the budget and number 11, City Hall East. Thank you so much for bringing attention and resources to East Oakland and deep East Oakland in particular. It's long overdue and I hope both items move forward.

This was an important signal to the arts and cultural stewards of our city as well as the community at large.  However, the fund balance of 5505 does not indicate a lack of intent for the use of the funds.

To simply offer some of the many options of this time with the A's, is it possible the current A's ownership would want to work with the AASCG and the new multipurpose stadium for the Coliseum area? And is it possible the current A's ownership would be willing to sell the team to new owners who would want to stay in Oakland to help build a good future with the AASCG at the Coliseum area? I still feel there may be too many environmental concerns at the Howard Terminal area for any type of sustainable future housing.  I think to develop the Coliseum area with small business ideas and truly affordable housing ideas of ELI, VLI, mixed income that have already been well planned by the MTC for the next decade in the Bay Area. These are the ideas of equity and reimagine that all sides should be considering at this time and simply how to consider the future of a city. The choices of current AIDs ownership staying at the Oakland Coliseum  and even selling the team so the A's can continue at the Coliseum are incredible acts of decency and a testament to the good efforts all sides seem to be making in the negotiation process at this time.

And this was after the fact that the  city applied and received award from the office of Head Start. However, we learned in early as December of 2020 that the city had contemplated contracting out some of the slots and jobs to other nonprofit partners. And it was going through the process of applying and receiving the grant  that we subsequently learned that about 30 or so positions were gonna be cut from the city side of the Head Start program and that sites were gonna be closed as a result of the lower grant amount. And so I would just urge the council as we move forward and as we deal with this issue in subsequent years to have a more transparent process around the grant making and application process  to include labor and allies in that process much earlier so that we're not kind of scrambling at the last minute like we have been over the past month or so.

I'm calling to support the Head Start parents and workers who are demanding no cuts, no layoffs, and no closures to Head Start programs. Head Start is an anti-poverty and an anti-crime program.  It provides critical social services that include childcare, nutrition, behavioral health, and housing referrals. Cuts to Head Start mean fewer good jobs in our community, less access to healthy food, and fewer childcare spaces for working families during a time of public health crisis. The mayor's proposed cuts will gut this vital program serving low-income black and brown families.  At the same time, Libya has called in outside state and federal law enforcement agencies, including California Highway Patrol, Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms to terrorize our communities. This is exactly backwards. Unlike policing, early education programs are one of the best ways to actually keep our communities safe.  Head Start has a multi-generational positive impact. The children of Head Start graduates are significantly more likely to finish high school, enroll in college, and are significantly less likely to be involved and caught up in the criminal legal system. Policing, incarceration, and poverty also have a multi-generational impact, but in the opposite direction.  I'm appalled that Libby Schaaf is again cutting social services while increasing criminalization and doing an end run around this city council to get more jackboots on our street instead of funding programs that actually keep us safe and healthy. Bringing in more outside law, unaccountable law enforcement agencies like CHP, FBI and ATF will make us less safe.

As a worker justice organization, we understand how important these programs are for working families and our communities as a whole.  From its inception, Head Start has proven to be an effective anti-poverty program that leads to far better outcomes for our most vulnerable children and families. It's imperative that we protect and preserve these programs, especially in neighborhoods like mine in Deep East Oakland that have experienced much destabilization and disinvestment over the last few decades.  We are due to immediately restore the current operation of this critical program and retain the Head Start staff in their positions, preserve current city-run childcare slots, and stop site closures, especially in East and West Oakland neighborhoods. Furthermore, workers and families directly impacted by these proposed cuts must be centered in the conversation and decisions about the future of our city's Head Start programs.  Lastly, please register our opposition of the mayor's proposal to enlist state and federal law enforcement agencies to patrol our city streets.

Much of it has already been spoken, but there's a 2016  You know, study that shows that Head Start children have a higher likelihood of graduating high school and attending college. There's another study from 2014 that shows that Head Start children have fewer child welfare encounters. There's another study that says Head Start children are 93% less likely to end up in foster care.  Head Start has just proven time and time and time again, whether longitudinal studies or otherwise, that it really is creates better social, emotional language, cognitive development, and particularly a black, brown and Asian students and children. So please save Head Start. Please vote yes. Thank you so much.",Education and Youth Services

I'm a District 7 resident and a member of the Anti-Police Terror Project.  And a mom to a two-year-old. I was at the press conference this morning and similarly to many people who have spoken, very, very, very grateful for Parent Voices Oakland and your leadership in both pointing this issue out and  just all over valuing, you can hear my little one here, the critical infrastructure that is childcare, caring for and educating young people. To me, there's nothing more precious, nothing more important than how we care for our next generation. And so I think that the attempt to defund Head Start by the city  while at the same time maintaining and trying to increase the budget of the police department that already gets hundreds of millions of dollars. And on top of that, bringing in outside agencies like CHP, FBI, and ATF with groups like California Highway Patrol, who, as people have mentioned, have murdered people's children in this town, blocks away from where we live. Eric Salgado was murdered. And so to see that black and brown children are not being valued in terms of both  the early education and care they receive and then as they grow to be targeted and murdered by police.  obviously is deeply troubling and disgusting. And so I'm here to speak towards the support of Head Start. As people have said, no cuts, no closures, no layoffs. And as Clarissa said, and thank you, Clarissa, for your leadership, also to extend the services. Anyone who's a parent knows that there's much more needed in terms of  universal health care and on and on. We could go on and on. But the last thing we should be doing is fighting for city workers to keep their jobs.",Education and Youth Services

I'm the Lake Merritt Black advocate, homeless advocate. I'd like to really jump in with the Head Start issue. The next time a 14-year-old shoots a 15-year-old, that's because programs like Head Start weren't available. Like Mr. Bird says, 70% of those kids go to a better mindset, get jobs, and it's a harm reduction program if you really think about it.  As to Melissa Bakken, please do not use my name, my likeness, or Photoshop my pictures for anything that you have to do with your organization OCP.  One of the issues that's pending at me still being at the tennis courts is some issue with storage space. How come the city can pay for a white person to be in a hotel for a whole year or multiple white people to be in a hotel for a whole year, but you don't wanna pay any of my storage? That's a problem with your...  I'm seeing more and more of the fact that it's a one-sided administration or a one-colored administration. I'm getting where I can't sugarcoat this anymore. It's just too blatant. As for Mr. Darwin, Bonta Graham, stop writing  articles to allow people like me to be to get money. She asked for funding and you put the article on the Oak side. And as for the Oak side, stop attacking black men that are homeless by putting in parentheses that they won't take housing, Natalie, when you don't know why they won't take housing from the city. So mind your P's and Q's on that. The white media is on the side of the city and really is crushing the black people out here. That's a big part of it.

First off, I'd like to thank the Head Start staff and families for all the incredible organizing and work they've put in since news broke about the administration's plans. It's not a surprise, of course, everything I've heard about the people who make Head Start. Head Start has been surrounded with praise, admiration, and appreciation for their energy, effort, and dedication that their workers have put in to ensure that our babies get the care and attention that they deserve.  Next, I want to thank Clarissa Douthert and Parent Voices Oakland for the tireless organizing that they have done to fight for the Head Start program. Finally, I'd like to thank  Carol Pfeiffer, her responsiveness on this issue. As a council member, I reached out to directly when APTP learned that Head Start was in jeopardy. I appreciate how you have moved from the time we first spoke through the council meeting today. I'd also like to thank council members who moved this legislation, Bass, Kaplan, and Tao. And I'd like to thank Council Member Reed for the clear commitment to the well-being of Head Start that she made today at the Tass Faranga Rec Center on 85th.  As the policy director for APTP, I'm constantly asked what it means to reimagine public safety, and I can think of no better example than the Head Start program. The public safety impacts of early childhood education are abundantly clear. There are countless studies that demonstrate those impacts. For example, in Chicago, children who are enrolled in a program for three- and four-year-olds were 70% less likely to be arrested for a violent crime than those who are not enrolled in early childhood programming.  So when the administration proposes cutting these programs and defunding Head Start, that is what makes our community less safe. The data show that it is those who are most under-resourced and underserved who are at the center of cycles of violence. And the data show that the best way to interrupt those cycles of violence is to provide resources and programming to those most impacted, something that Head Start does and does well.  We need a robust and thriving Head Start program in Oakland. Our Black, Brown, and Indigenous babies deserve it. The Anti-Police Terror Project will continue to stand with Head Start workers and PBO until we get what we deserve. Thank you.",Education and Youth Services

We need more slots, and we will see child care money coming from the feds, so we should be prepared to open more. The idea of closing places like Lincoln, Head Start, Tassafuranga is actually criminal, and I don't understand how we could have had a mayor who made sure that these stayed open to a mayor who wants to close  the programs that our kids at East and West Oakland need the most.

And this is in reference to the Head Start item. I just want to register support for  Maintaining services as being delivered and also expanding services. I represent an organization that organizes hundreds of families across the county. We've been successful with the passage of Measure C to increase revenue to early childhood education, increase wages to childcare workers, which are some of the most under-resourced  least paid workers possible, which is why it is incredibly important that we stop any layoffs and any restructuring that means that black and brown women who provide services every day to our children could lose their jobs. This is absolutely, it is unbelievable that we are even considering cuts to these vital programs during a pandemic. Any site closures, understanding that we are losing facilities and childcare that we may not even be able to  support all of the new slots that could be coming from transitional kindergarten to preschool, that closing any facilities right now should be off the table. And again, as someone who grew up in a family with civil servants workers who were able to buy a home and retire and support me and my goals and dreams, I think it's incredibly offensive  to not figure out a way to maintain city employees and to maintain the good jobs and benefits in our city, given the incredible service that the Head Start workers provide.

My neighbors and I have been reporting code violations for years. I warned the city and developers not to place a giant crane and its tons of counterweights on top of 19th Street until a structural analysis of that street was performed. Sure enough, the weight of the crane broke a large water main under 19th Street. This caused an enormous flood. We lost the water in our building. PG&E was pumping water out of their underground vaults blocks away.  AT&T was replacing copper wire under Broadway for days. The developer will suffer no penalty for their negligence. It comes out of our pockets, the taxpayers and ratepayers of Oakland. I warned you that the ongoing street parties on Broadway were out of control and murder was imminent. For years, we have been petitioning Greg Miner and Mobile Food Vending to relocate the food trucks that had moved in. Sure enough, an 18-year-old man was murdered right in front of our windows at 2.45 Sunday mornings.  He had just moved here to attend college and did not yet understand the danger we face here. Two young women were also shot and injured. I told you this was going to happen. I spoke to an officer today who's on our street collecting evidence while investigating this murder. He recognized that these illegal street parties are out of control, but said there is nothing the police can do. He told me I need to discuss this with city council. I told him I have, and here I am again. You can help us by instituting some simple preventative measures. The violence we experience here will continue to expand.  The body count will grow.

This use of ground floor commercial as affordable workspace may also be a model to be considered for the downtown plan for new developments.  With BCZ and Curtis Development, this team has significant project and program experience to support the creation of the proposed catalyst project, Liberation Park, to bring the community's vision for the site to life. Thank you to city staff and city council members for this opportunity.",Urban Development

No one, including this counsel, you've given them all this money, and neither one of you have chosen to ask for them to produce the document that affirms their legal status. What's wrong with you?

They never asked Oakland Promise to produce any documents. Oh, it's in the Secretary of State. A lot of the things are there in the legal venue. It's just like Oakland Promise should not be in the city charter. It's a private organization. That ballot measure should never have occurred.

On the macro topic, I'm certainly happy to see that it's moving from consent to non-consent. I think that's a very good decision. I wanted to thank the city for making sure that the macro jobs are going to be well paid and union jobs. This is something we've been advocating for a very long time.  Just happened to look at my Nextdoor account and see that a resident of 82nd Avenue has had an issue with somebody who is continually feeding her dog ice cream, which is getting to her and she's very livid about it and doesn't know what to do or who to call.  This is a perfect example of the kind of issue that macro responders should be responding to. These are not mental health calls that require clinicians. The calls that macro are supposed to respond to are really quality of life calls.  situational and immediate issues that can be responded to in a voluntary way, not with the ability to commit someone to 5150, which would completely undermine the trust that people have in the macro response system.  So I want to encourage the council to continue to prioritize the fundamental role of macro, which is to respond to these kinds of low-level calls that are not requiring clinicians, that are not defined as mental health, but are situational and circumstantial issues.

I'm an Oakland resident and I'm calling today about the update on the bike plan. So two years ago, this bike plan was created and it said that Oakland would create 51 miles of protected bike lanes. And so far, three years later, we've only created 2.5 of those 51 miles. So we're only 4.9% of the way towards  the plan and this is a big problem because as the whole point of the bike plan was to build out a network of safe lanes and Oakland has the highest rate of people killed in traffic collisions of any city in the Bay Area. And it's four times more dangerous in Oakland than San Francisco, which also has a lot of traffic deaths.  We have more than double the number of traffic deaths than San Francisco and they have more than twice the population that we have. So we have a huge epidemic on our streets of people getting killed by cars and this protected bike lane network and the bike plan which had the buy-in of everyone is the path towards reducing those fatal collisions and yet  We're not making any substantial progress on this. I'd like the council to produce a report on why there hasn't been progress on the bike plan since it was passed back in 2019 and a proposal for how and when we're gonna see significant progress towards the completion of this network.

How can I get out of this landlord-tenant paradigm and do my own housing at a cost-effective way that is in harmony with the environment? That led me to tiny homes like it has led many others, and it will continue to drive droves of people to seriously consider this new and actually very old idea of a home that can move. I strongly advise you to begin to imagine a world outside of this binary landlord-tenant paradigm, one where everyday people like the group that started Neighborship  take housing into their own hands and make their own choices. The ordinance that you're going to consider today should pass, but it's important to be honest about the fact that it will not have much impact on our affordability crisis. And that's by design. This ordinance ignores our six-year example and many other examples like us, where a community of homes on wheels existed under everyone's noses,  No sewer lines were ever installed. Density was much larger than one to three units and the sky didn't fall. Rather, this was a space with a stable home for countless working class people for the last six years. If you'd like to make this ordinance actually live up to much of the lofty language I've heard from you all on the need to open up options, there's two small adjustments. Exempt vehicular residential facilities from density restrictions and allow sanitation alternatives that include port-a-potty service.  In many ways, this ordinance is a microcosm of a broader approach to housing regulations that would flabbergast any visiting alien. We are still too squeamish to permit clusters of poor people to exist anywhere but the most obstructive situations that increase maximum suffering for everyone involved. And we are still too uncomfortable with allowing housing to take a form that doesn't match the standards and the costs that  that are so much that nobody can actually produce them we continue to pass legislation that says effectively you can build a house but you've got to be a unicorn dancing on one leg in the bermuda triangle or filthy rich please pass this ordinance and hopefully we'll get closer to what people really need at a later date thanks thank you and madam chair we have one speaker left and then a hand go up how do you wish to proceed",Housing

First of all, I'd like to recognize Native American Heritage Month. That's something good about our American Indian folks that are here in our country and how some of them are still living on reservations. It's really sad. Secondly, I'd like to say to anybody that doesn't realize why I've been off topic today is I have decided as an act of civil disobedience that I would not waste my two minutes on anything about black issues, black homeless issues.  I also like to say that anybody that thinks I'm some kind of radical black person, I have a son that's half white. And if it seems like I'm targeting James Vann, that's because I expect to see him at Target with a gift card because of his statement about trying to help downtown streets.  to get a solid building. That's ridiculous. There are nothing but slave owners as far as I'm concerned. Also, I'd like to say,  Injustice anywhere is a blow to justice everywhere. So those that had criminalized the homeless here in our parks and schools, don't forget in Texas, they have a law that if you are getting an abortion, anybody can sue you for $10,000. Injustice anywhere is a blow to justice everywhere. And once again, I like to say,  Don't do the white thing. Do the right thing when it comes to Oakland politics. Everyone has the opportunity to change at any day and do the right thing. Mr. Cobb, I need your help. The white media will not let me say what I need to say. I'm going to try to reach out again.

Of course, as a Zoom webinar, we're not actually able to know exactly how many people were actually in attendance, how many residents.  versus how many people were just developers, nonprofit affiliates, construction, union representatives, financial representatives, et cetera. The whole plan has not been very clear. I respect that we've heard from a number of folks who are affiliated closely, it sounds like, with these organizations, but in terms of actual outreach to rank and file members of the community,  with respect to the agency meeting and not being able to do stuff in person. I just don't feel like the community engagement has actually been there.

For over a year, we've seen them  frontline in our community. We haven't seen the other group. Yesterday, I had the opportunity to watch the community District 7 meeting, and the question was asked about community engagement. And the AASG has had over 50 signed endorsements from the community. When the other group was asked, they struggled to mention five. And so really, that's what this boils down to, is community engagement.  Four months ago, this body said they would take four to six months to figure out who they wanted to support. There were 70 murders at that time. Now we have over 120. So inaction has real life consequences. I'm urging you today, vote for the AASCG for an ENA so that they can get to work with the real business of providing real benefits that affect real people's lives. Please act today. Thank you.",General Community Organizing

But if we focus on the positives of finalizing this decision today and what this will do for our community.  The AASCG has set the plan of bringing jobs, revenue, affordable housing to this community. But not just that, they've also have plans to revitalize East Oakland while not gentrifying it. And that's just to name a few of the things that I've heard that they're planning to do. For those of us who live here in Oakland, we know it's a special place. It's a privilege to live here, but this project is gonna shoot Oakland into the stratosphere.  And then worldwide, everyone will know just how special Oakland is. So every day that is pushed back, that's another day that our community can't thrive, it can't benefit from this amazing project that's been set forth by the AASCG. I was at that meeting as well last night that's been mentioned for District 7. And I just have to say, and just to say lightly, AASCG is clearly the right choice.

Some of these organizations are East Oakland Collective, Planning Justice, Black Culture Zone. What I know is,  AASEG has been at the front for engaging the community to find out what activities, what priorities, and what exactly is it that they need. So what did they do? They came and sat with us, the entire community engagement, and we are able to  talk about the benefits as what the community will need and what we've seen that they will be providing. That's workforce development, that's housing, that's sports and entertainment, that's environmental benefits, and that's hope that the community is already on board with. We have not heard from anything from the other proposal, and that does sadden us. We would love everyone to come together, but they have not engaged the community  at all as to what are the priorities and what is it that these community needs in Deep East Oakland really need.

Karen Chenoy, government affairs director with the Bridge Association of Realtors. We would like to thank you for your support of item 2.17 on the consent calendar, authorizing the city administrator to apply to the CalHome program for funds to assist first-time homebuyers with mortgage assistance. And this is a great step in bolstering Oakland's first-time homebuyer programs.  Communities across the Bay Area from San Francisco, Emeryville, perhaps now Berkeley, are realizing that mortgage assistance is a necessary tool to help residents grow deeper roots in their communities through home ownership. We're also seeing down payment assistance programs being created across the nation, like in Evanston, Illinois, that will provide dedicated funding for housing reparations for the Black residents of that city.  In addition to that CalHome funded program before you at item 2.17, if you take a look at the correspondence at attachment A to that item, you can see that Oakland already has another highly effective mortgage assistance program led by a highly competent city staff, which has remained unfunded for some time. This is unfortunate because the majority of first-time homebuyers that benefit from mortgages assisted by that program in Oakland are people of color.  And there are still many affordable homeownership opportunities for Oaklanders, and the city's programs providing mortgage assistance have been very popular in the past. So the Cal Home Program, which is the subject of today's item, as well as the Oakland Mortgage Assistance Program, which remains unfunded, have routinely been able to directly provide funds to Oaklanders to purchase their first homes. And the cost benefit of that program is highlighted in Attachment A.  With that being said, thank you in advance for supporting item 2.17 today. We truly hope you will support the city's other mortgage assistance programs moving forward. Thank you.",Housing

We're cautiously optimistic that this organization will ultimately make some significant commitments toward the following goals. Any developer seeking to build out the Coliseum and other public land must deliver on quality jobs with living wages and benefits, workforce development, local hiring, and fair chance hiring programs to remove barriers to employment for formerly incarcerated people.  Such requirements must apply across the board to all project partners and tenants. Developers must commit to a minimum of 35% deeply affordable housing and significant funding to support anti-displacement services for East Oakland and other flatland tenants. Developers must also commit to supporting a healthy environment. To contribute to healthy Oakland, the project must ensure clean air, clean up toxic sources, utilize clean energy infrastructure, and support clean businesses.

It is open to the city councilors to make nominations to the mayor and the mayor confirming it. But those nominations are always published publicly. And then people can make comments either to in support of the nominee or in opposition. And this process is once again under this  the last section of setting up macro showing secrecy that is totally unwarranted.

Whichever partnership group you choose, I'd like you to require them to include a renovated ballpark in their plans to work closely with the A's to keep them at the Coliseum as well. I'd like to thank Councilmember Reed for her leadership in hosting a town hall last night where D7 residents were able to learn more about the many concepts and ideas  and resources and opportunity each group shared. I want a win-win for Oakland by protecting our port, waterfront and jobs, keeping the A's out of Howard Terminal and in East Oakland at the Coliseum, where East Oakland community has invested their support for years. Let's imagine all jobs, resources, and wonderful opportunities that will come to East Oakland with this new development.  and possibly WNBA team and or Black-owned NFL team and the A's at the Coliseum too, Council?

Hi, Council President Bass and members of the Oakland City Council. My name is Ray Leon. For more than 20 years, plus years, I served as policy analyst for the most senior council member to ever serve on this council. This decision you're making today is not personal, it's business.  And it's the business of the residents of Oakland who have charged all of you of being the stewards of their interests. It's public land. To rush to do a decision is deplorable when it's a $100 million-plus acquisition and you've allowed five, well, now thanks to Council President Bass, eight-minute presentations to decide on this site. To fully vet the financials is yours and the staff's responsibility.  Broken promises from various members of the AASCG team in the past should be considered. No agreement with the NFL, no agreement with the WNBA, no agreement with the Warriors, and no relationship agreement with the A's who own 50%.  The Stuart Murray Group, they have four strong points in their proposal. One, financial stability, payment in full on acquisition costs at the quickest amount of time possible, not over a timeframe, not over years, but immediately.  A developer who has shown in the past they have built projects in District 7, as well as the leading Black developer who has built affordable housing throughout this entire Bay Area. A relationship with the A's that constitutes 50% of the ownership,  who have already engaged in discussions to reach an agreement. And finally, community leaders such as Bishop Bob Jackson, Donald Lacey, myself, Brian Shaw, Damian Lillard, Dave Stewart, and Michael Johnson, who have actually put boots on the ground in that community. I implore you to make the decision to support the Stewart-Murray proposal in moving forward with this project. Thank you.",Governance and Civic Engagement

Good afternoon, Madam Council President and esteemed members of the council and everyone under the sound of my voice. My name is John Jones III. I'm on staff with Building Opportunities for Self-Sufficiency, also known as BOSS, where I serve as the director of reentry and violence prevention programs. I'm also a member of the African-American Sports and Entertainment Group, and I am urging you all to vote for this proposal.  I want to start with a quote that's attributed to William Gladstone. Justice delayed is justice denied. East Oakland has seen this for far too long. I was born in East Oakland in 1974. So I've lived long enough to see that in my part of town, we have not seen the development. We have seen a loss of institutions that serve the youth, that serve elders, and that overall contributes to a higher quality of life.  This proposal meets that in so much more. There are an intersection and an interwoven number of issues that's plaguing our community. And again, the proposal presented by AASCG will go a long way toward providing solutions to these problems. When I talk to youth and young adults, the first thing I often hear, and I hear this especially having a 19-year-old son, is there is nothing to do.  And I'm sad for them, because when I grew up in East Oakland at the Coliseum site, we had the Malibu, we had the Grand Prix. Malibu Grand Prix, we had the Castle Video Parlor. The point is, we need people to have a place to have pride in, a place to live, to congregate. And we've seen this, especially with this pandemic that created so much social isolation.  So at the end of the day, the ASEG is a team that consists of Black women and men with a proven track record of giving back to this community that we all love and call home. Now is the time to make the decision because we have too much going on to continue to put this off because that is not fair to the residents who are suffering and living in marginalized conditions. So again, I'd like to thank you for your leadership and above all, your courage.",General Community Organizing

I'm David Morales, Artistic Director of Contare Con Vivo, a successful and respected arts organization in Oakland for the past 35 years that has received cultural arts funding these past 12 consecutive years, but surprisingly is not currently on the organizational assistance proposed funding list. We recognize that the application process itself needs attention and adjustments going forward and anticipate that happening under Roberto Bedoya's leadership in the coming season.  We are recommending that the council approve funding for all Oakland Arts applicants, including the six legacy arts organization currently excluded for this two year cycle. This public recognition of support is crucial for both new and legacy organizations who together uniquely touch tens of thousands of Oakland lives through the arts.  Allocating additional funding to meet the total requested amount is the best case scenario. But if that is not readily possible, then we recommend a redistribution of the allocated $670,000. By granting every applicant 80.24% of their requested amount, all applicants will receive essential funding for two years to help ensure stability and success at this very critical time.

This is Anita Ayotte and Joyce with The Village in Oakland. Just want to let you know, want to get this on record, that last week we came home from working. I've been living with my family in my vehicle in District 3 for the past three years in the same exact spot to find that four vehicles that were used as homes, businesses, livelihoods, and services, four unhoused people were stolen by the city of Oakland. Our vehicle for The Village and three other vehicles people live and work out of were stolen because they did not have current registration.  Several housed folks who live on the same block as us had their vehicles tabbed for not having current registration. So the unhoused folks were never tagged. The housed folks were. The unhoused folks were never given notice. The unhoused folks were never offered adequate shelter. There is a moratorium still in place for vehicles for people to live in to not be towed. But this could be further from the truth. Since Wednesday, I have been in advocacy with members of HOG, Just Cities, and Nikki Fortuna, boss's office, to get the administration to waive all fees. We got all fees waived.  This is the fourth time I have witnessed the city do this when they have towed people's homes. This morning I went to OPD at 8 a.m. to get all the paperwork we needed. Village folks went to the tow yard today to get our truck, which houses the village administrative offices and the cardboard and concrete studios. Because the city only waived all the fees until yesterday, they charged us $189 today. Much better than the several thousand they wanted in total. But they destroyed our truck.  They removed the steering wheel and the steering column, and all the property in the truck is destroyed. Our perfectly working box truck that served homeless folks no longer works. Our art is destroyed. And several unhoused folks are traumatized by this. But wait, there's more. Media came over to cover what was going on when they heard what happened. The tow company locked the gate and locked the media journalist inside the yard.  And then also, I wasn't doing the top part. Two other volunteers were. Me, my daughter, and one of our high school interns were doing Feed the People when we got the call from our volunteers of what was going on. We have hot barbecue chicken dinners from Lena's Soul Food Cafe, courtesy of Lena's Soul Food Cafe and Community Kitchens.

It's not often we hear Palestine at City Council. I wish we did hear more support, but it's great to hear it from an ally. So thank you. I just want to say, you know, it's not a question of which developer was better. The question is, who knows?  Any developer can put a lot of effort into outreach, and that's wonderful. That's great. But those promises don't mean anything. We know that from watching Dave Cavall talk to the CBA committee after two years of making promises the A's don't want to live up to. We know that AASCG is a company. Their bottom line is money. They want to make money. We know that they battled with the Coliseum  for the licensing negotiations. They fought to get all the money from parking, for example. I remember that presentation from the director of the JPA. So I just think council is sort of, you know, issuing its responsibility to be a good arbiter the way public land is disposed of just for,  And I think it's unfortunate because people, thousands of people came to council years ago to make sure that there was some responsibility, some kind of due diligence around the disposition of public land. And those people's efforts meant something. And people really wanted council to stand up for the public's right to have public land be used for public good, not for the benefit of billionaires and rich people. And it's sad to see the most progressive council not do that.  and instead hide behind platitudes and politics. I hope that doesn't become the way things are from now on.

And I wanted to express my excitement in the development of the MACRO implementation and that burgeoning team. It's very exciting. They're doing exceptional work. Bringing the MACRO Community Advisory Board appointments into alignment with how other members of boards and commissions are selected is important. The current advisory board language for MACRO  says that the city manager has sole authority to appoint and remove advisory board members. Council nominations help to build the council's ongoing engagement and commitment to macro and strengthens the community voice and oversight. In order to ensure the voices and participation of the Oaklanders in neighborhoods with the highest proportion of service calls, please consider adding additional seats to be appointed from those districts.  Changing the appointment structure would ensure diverse representation on the macro advisory board. It does not delay macro implementation for the council to decide to participate in the selection of advisory board members. It simply demonstrates the council's commitment to ongoing community engagement and oversight of macro and ensuring representation by the people served by the macro project.

I'm originally from New Orleans, Louisiana, and moved to Richmond maybe about four years ago. I experienced a period of hard times, whereas I seen an ad in the paper for teaching of labor skills in construction. And it was the union labor union of  North America, LIUNA, that trained me and taught me what I needed to learn in order to acquire the job that I needed to have in order to better my life. I went from making maybe eight, nine, $10 an hour to 17 or better. Best job paying was almost $20 an hour. And I went from just paying my bills and barely making it to having some semblance of seeing daylight and getting on my feet.  In four years, I went from homelessness to my own place to start my own business. And all of that was afforded to us because the union trained us. But we operate out of South Carolina, North Carolina, because there is no union in Virginia. It's a work for hire state, and we're getting fighted on every side to start a labor union in Virginia.  And I am living proof that if crime would go down, recidivism would go down, if you can afford the citizens of Virginia, Richmond, the necessary tools that they need in order to better their lives, things will turn around. I'm living proof that it can. Thank you so much.",Homelessness

I live in what is referred to as an annexed portion of the city of Richmond off of Hopkins Road.  The street that comes into my neighborhood is Lost Lane and intersects with Talbot Drive. There is a corner store at Lost Lane and Hopkins and bus stops on both sides of Hopkins Road. Just recently, a sidewalk improvement project was completed on the entrance side of Hopkins leading into Lost Lane.  The sidewalk needs to be extended farther into Lost Lane because of the pedestrian traffic to the bus stops and the corner store. Presently, there is a very deep ditch that is a hazard to the pedestrians walking on Lost Lane.  I have contacted the Office of Public Works. A return call by Anthony Harding said an inspector would ascertain the necessity of my request. I was advised that I should ask assistance from city council in addressing this request.  I implore the council to consider the danger to the elderly, the young children, and others who frequent this street be reviewed in consideration of their safety when walking and traveling on Lost Lane. I have previously addressed the council on this matter and I am again asking for your support.  I also, again, am asking for the installation of trash cans in our neighborhood to help minimize litter. Thank you.",Transportation and Mobility

I've lived in Richmond for three years now. One of those years was spent in the American Tobacco Center in Chaco Bottom, and the other one was spent in the River Lofts in Chaco Bottom. And I want to bring up the issue of recycling in apartment complexes in Richmond. Neither of those facilities offered recycling that was easily accessible to residents, and it's my understanding that most apartment complexes do not offer recycling to residents.  to the residents. Because of that, the general trend is that nobody recycles. I've sent an image of the trash can outside of my apartment tonight, which is largely full of aluminum cans, bottles, cardboard, and other miscellaneous trash. It's especially disheartening to me knowing that this stuff is being thrown in the trash when aluminum cans can, when recycled, save up to 95% of the emissions that they would if they were created from scratch.  My further concern for this is as Richmond tends to grow and as like was just mentioned, there is limited housing in Richmond. So the general trend for that has been establishing large apartment complexes. These apartment complexes do not offer recycling to their residents. About 34% of Richmond's residents rent their housing and a large percentage of those people live in apartment complexes.  There are more complexes arriving every year. Just down the street from me, two complexes are going up and have gone up in the last year, and in Scott's addition, at least one has gone up in the last prior year. It feels like every other article posted on Richmond BizSense is about a new projected apartment complex, and it's generally understood that Richmond needs more dense housing in order to grow.  So trying to understand this problem, I called the Central Virginia Waste Management Association. They are generally interested in collecting recycling from apartment complexes. My understanding of the situation after talking with them is that they don't collect it because the city doesn't provide an infrastructure for apartment complexes to offer recycling to their residents. Wondering why this was, I poked around the DPU website. I spotted that  Businesses are allotted up to four supercans before requiring private contracts for waste disposal. I'm wondering if these limits are applied to multifamily and mixed-use residents, and if so, why that is. The world has a waste problem, and Richmond isn't exempt from this. Fairfax County realized the same problem and now requires  recycling for all multifamily residents. As a taxpaying citizen of Richmond, I don't expect recycling to be limited to the homeowners. Thank you. Thank you.",Utilities

The letter was sent directly to your email this morning with 125 signatures  And as of five o'clock, we have 158 signatures. Your neglect to provide adequate emergency shelter services in the city of Richmond is frankly unacceptable. Elected officials and Homeward can no longer ignore the magnitude of this problem. I heard your discussion in the informal meeting, and I want to emphasize the need for action over discussion. The crisis is putting lives at risk daily,  Prior to COVID-19, we had existing eviction crises and a lack of affordable housing with a disparate impact on black and brown communities. In March 2020, RPD demolished Camp Kathy in direct violation of CDC recommendations cited in the letter. The cold weather shelter has been non-operational this winter. There was supposedly a plan from homework to place people seeking shelter into hotel rooms. However, that has not materialized and there's been a lack of funding to maintain individual rooms.  Thus, many people have been sleeping in the lobby of the hotel in communal format or sleeping outdoors. I wonder if any of you have ever slept outdoors in January. Aligned with the Social Work Code of Ethics values of service, social justice, the dignity and worth of each person, and integrity, we demand that you, one, find the funding to provide shelter for all who need it through this crisis and beyond. Two, extend the eviction moratorium and include persons in shelter services. Three,  Make a clear public statement about how you will address this crisis. Four, ensure the housing crisis line is properly staffed. Five, call for RPD to end the harassment and slashing of tents of our houseless population. Six, call for an immediate IRS investigation into Homeward's use of funds. This crisis will only become worse as people suffer from pandemic-related unemployment, and the lack of adequate shelter services will add to the COVID cases and death toll.  The present situation requires your immediate action. Now is the time to act swiftly and with integrity. What I've witnessed so far is this pandemic, it can bring out the worst in people or the best in us. And I want this call to action to be an opportunity for your best selves to emerge. If you have a modicum of social ethics or human compassion, you will do the right thing. I close by saying rest in peace and power to Mr. Irving Peanut Ward  and all those who have lost their lives due to houselessness. May their memories be a blessing.

My name is Beth Orcutt, and I am here this evening on behalf of the Carytown community to ask for your help in receiving beautification funding to maintain our neighborhood in the coming year.  Carytown features over 200 businesses who jointly generate millions of dollars annually in tax revenue for the city through both meals and sales tax. As a small business owner, I volunteer my time and my staff's time to tidy our sidewalks through monthly cleanups, but the neighborhood needs more than a monthly cleanup to be maintained.  While the Carytown Merchants Association had a paid employee who cleaned the neighborhood on a daily basis last year, with our lack of funding this year, the association has had to lay off this employee three weeks ago. The trash accumulation in our neighborhood has become overwhelming in just that short amount of time.  As this past year has shown us, outdoor venues are of special value these days and Carytown as an outdoor mall of sorts has become a safe haven for folks craving an outing in the new world that we now live in. In addition, its unique character as a collection of small businesses has made us especially vulnerable during this challenging year.  Our neighborhood isn't only a venue for locals, it's also a top tourist attraction, according to TripAdvisor, Thrillist, and Travel Channel, all referencing a trip to Carytown as a top activity for first-time city visitors. I fear that with a lack of funding to maintain Carytown, we will not only become overrun with trash, but also negatively impact our tourism industry.  I speak for both Carytown small business owners and residents in asking for this financial assistance. In driving down Cary Street on my way to work this morning, instead of seeing a collection of colorful small businesses, I saw disposable masks, takeout cups, cardboard signs, and milk crates. I saw homeless camps and graffitied walls. This is not what the neighborhood looked like a year ago or even a month ago.  We need your support in revitalizing our beloved neighborhood.

I'm the Executive Director with Read to Them. We're a local nonprofit organization based in Richmond, and our mission is to create a culture of literacy in every home.  The reason I'm here to share with you tonight is an upcoming literacy program that's going to be occurring throughout the entire city of Richmond, including all 26 RPS elementary schools, and will be kicking off on March 1st. We are going to be reading, all across the city of Richmond, The Trumpet of the Swan by E.B. White.  If you're not familiar with this book, don't worry.

It's an incredible community building experience.

The public library system will be supporting this initiative as well. And it is also a partnership that is made possible through a partnership with the Virginia Bankers Association and the Virginia Economic Council.  If you're not familiar with the story, this is the story of Louis the trumpeter swan who's born without the ability to honk, which creates a lot of turmoil in his life and makes him feel as though he does not fit in. And we are going to be studying economic  aspects of this book through lots of different activities and discussions as we follow Lewis on his journey to earn the funds he needs to purchase a trumpet so that he has the ability to communicate with other swans. It's a lovely story.  We will be partnering with local banks to help support getting the books for all of the kids, and that's made possible through the Virginia Bankers Association. And we are hoping that you will all follow along as we do live readings of each chapter of the book daily throughout the month of March. If anyone is interested in participating in those live readings, we will be  We will have places for you to be able to do that. I'm sure that your districts would love to see your faces online reading these chapters out loud for all of our students. We'll be doing that in both English and Spanish. And if you're not interested in reading, I completely understand that, but please do follow along. We'll be releasing daily trivia questions each day on our social media outlets and doing lots of fun activities to encourage both literacy and learning new economic concepts.  So thank you for those who have supported us in the past in this initiative. I know we've had lots of support from city council members. Many of you might be familiar with this initiative, and I really appreciate all the support that you've given, and we hope that you will follow along and support this initiative this year and in the future as well.",Education and Youth Services

About nine months ago, Ordinance 2019343, also known as short-term rentals ordinance, was passed. While it passed, it was generally recognized by council as not having been fully vetted and to be revisited at a later date.  That formal review, which I believe is a deliverable of the Planning Commission, is coming due at the one year mark, which should be around July. And since the implementation of that ordinance, we've seen departure of Mark Olinger and John Wack.  Because of that, it's kind of leading me to believe that there's no real owner to bring the topic back up to the table. And someone like myself or the public is now acting as the medium for continuity.  So I have a request to speak with the Planning Commission at their meeting next week, and I'm also suggesting informal working sessions are reestablished with the Council sponsor. I feel those were very effective prior to the rollout of implementation and would probably be the best forum to get some changes implemented, perhaps around the time of the review due in July.  But basically I do not see the intent of the legislation is being met and I also don't see any changes. For that ordinance at the time, so I just ask that you revisit that and check whether you think the intent has been met. Thank you.",Housing

My name is Guadalupe Ramirez Blevins, and today is the International Day of the Women, and I wish to take a moment with you today to look at what Carytown means as a road of opportunity to minority women immigrants like myself.  I came to this country with a little more than a work ethic. I support myself and my infant child by selling on the streets of Carytown for two years before I had enough saved up to get a storefront.  I was hard at the time to find a property manager who will rent to me. They asked me if I understand that I could not live on the property or have chickens in it. Carytown is very different as it was 25 years ago. Almost every shop and restaurant that I have seen open,  And the last few years have been working women and many of them minorities. When you walk down Cary Street,  and visit the stores, you find business owners who are there working, some of us seven days a week. Well, while there are a few chains, most of the shops and restaurants are owner operated. We don't have a great deal of capital. We have  a work ethic to try to create something better than the system provide us. We are all concerned  when the funding to provide better funding for the schools. As a business owner, I wish for the city to attract clientele who have disposable income to purchase items from my store. Resources are tight and I respect that I consider  to view council's sacred responsibility to ensure the stewardship and the common resources and ensure sustainable development for the city. I think it's evident enough that supporting Carytown is an investment in sustaining the property and sales tax income for the city.  What I wish to communicate is that Carytown is now the most multicultural segment of the city. I believe Carytown represents what is a promising future for the city. Young people want diversity and a walk down Carytown today is like visiting United Nations.  for me represented a path for a better future and this is a message that i wish to communicate today thank you thank you that's your time thank you miss Blevins madam Clark the next speaker the next speaker is Thomas Courtney",Economic Development

There's a report coming due in July, and I wanted to refresh City Council's memory on the following paraphrased comments from the June 22, 2020 meeting. Representative Lynch made a prediction that in one year we will have regrets  no revenue, and we won't be able to recover the initiative. Representative Hilbert, ready to implement something so that changes can be made in the future, but disappointed that revenue stream was not included in the ordinance. Representative Jones, excuse me, confused how there were multiple prerequisite meetings with no changes to the ordinance, would prefer a policy that works. Representative Gray, it's taken three years to implement a flawed ordinance, but it's a start.  Representative Newbill, the number of discussion items indicated in the revisiting this topic is needed. Since implementation, there have been 24 applications, 10 approvals and a 36 month contract commitment with a committed expense of $33,244 a year to a third party.

My name is Bob Wheatley, and I'm a business owner here in Carytown, and I also own a condo in the fan, so I have a vested interest in Carytown and the surrounding area. I'm here this evening on behalf of the Carytown Merchants Association asking for support of the application we submitted for discretionary funding for the continued beautification efforts here in Carytown.  One of the most persistent problems we deal with is litter along Cary Street itself and on the side streets and in the alleys. There seems to be a constant barrage of trash, cigarette butts, masks, and other things that just don't seem to make it into the receptacles. We do have monthly cleanups that are organized by the Emergency Association, RVA Clean Sweep, and residents of the local neighborhoods, but once a month is not nearly enough to combat the issue.  In the past, we've hired a person dedicated solely to picking up trash a couple of times a week for several hours a day, and it was effective while it lasted, but we realized that the City of Richmond doesn't have the capacity or the resources to hire a person for this specific task, so we took it upon ourselves to do so.  Without the necessary funding, obviously, we can't continue to pay for such a person, and therefore, we recently had to let that person go because of our budget constraints in the association. Carytown is a unique and historical shopping district and obviously attracts tourists from around the region. A simple internet search on top attractions in Richmond, Virginia, Carytown comes up as number five on TripAdvisor.  However, along with restaurants and boutique shops, it also attracts professional service businesses such as mine because of its vibrant and unique character. It's also centrally located with easy access to the interstate and Poway Parkway, so my clients don't have to drive all the way downtown or out to the suburbs to get to my office. Therefore, I think it's important to try and fill the vacancies, the current vacancies right now,  that are in Kerrytown with long-term sustainable businesses. But potential business owners will be turned off if the streets look littered and unkempt. And strictly going by observation, we've also noticed a correlation between graffiti in areas where trash is the most prevalent. And it seems like graffiti would be another big turnoff for potential businesses in this area. It would seem to exacerbate the problem of vacancies going unfilled.  To me, filling those vacancies creates long-term tax revenue to the city, so I'd imagine that it would be a top priority to get those filled, and keeping the streets clean and the graffiti at bay should also be a priority, and funding should be viewed as a reinvestment in the city and in our community. And partnering...  with local business community organizations such as the Carytown Merch Association to take care of the issue is the logical thing to do. Really, without the Carytown Merch Association, no one else would really take care of this place.",Urban Development

This is Rodney Hall and Ivy Hall calling from 2020 Ingram Avenue. Just wanted to first thank the first precinct captain as well as the officers over there who have stepped up patrols in the Oak Grove neighborhood. They're doing an excellent job. Also wanted to let you all know of our support as well as the Oak Grove community for One Casino and Resort. As we've been talking to neighbors as well as the president,  of the Oak Grove Civic Association, Rosa Jones. Quite a few individuals in the neighborhood have supported One Casino and Resort, not just because it's a casino, but also because it's going to be a resort. One of the most important things that stands out to me being a mass comm person is the fact that One Casino plans on giving at least $50 million to advertising, $25 million to Richmond, Virginia, advertising to a  advertise and broadcast among all of the urban one media radio stations, which is very important. In addition to that, the 1500 permanent jobs that they're offering to Richmond residents, an annual salary of $55,000 per year. And most important for me, someone that grew up in the eighth district is jobs, jobs, jobs, location, location, location.  As you travel down Richmond Highway, you think about young people, and I know all young people will not be able to work in the casino, but there are other entities of this resort that they would be able to work in. There are very, very few jobs over here in the 8th District that young people can get to very easily. So that is one of the things that sold me when it came to one casino and a lot of the other individuals that you talk to here in the area. The other thing is location, location, location. It's right off of 95.  It doesn't impact neighborhoods like the other proposals have. It is very close to the airport, bringing airport or folks that are flying in easily from 895 as well as from 95 coming south. And it offers an opportunity for us to use the James River because it won't be that far from the Port of Richmond. So an idea that came to my mind is suppose we could have  Tours that could go up the James River, just like we had with the Annabelle League, maybe drop tourists off at different locations, possibly Rockets Landing, so that they could visit historic Churchill. And maybe another stop, we could have a tour mobile that could actually take them to Scott's Edition. But the thing about Scott's Edition  is it's already saturated. A lot of the folks don't want it there. And as we talked to the people in the eighth district, they definitely want the economic development. They definitely want the jobs. And as far as security is concerned, they think the security and the police presence will be beefed up because you have a casino and resort in this area. And that's all I have for right now.",Economic Development

First, I want to apologize. The last time I was called to speak, I was unable to get on due to technical difficulties. So I apologize for that. I was supposed to speak on the public safety building. But I appreciate what the council did on that to include private labor agreements on that project. I speak in my capacity.  as the president of a nonprofit here, Project Give Back to Community, and a co-founder of the organization, and also in my capacity as a lead organizer for the laborers union here in the city of Richmond. I'm speaking to show support and to ask that you support the construction of one casino here in the city of Richmond.  I want to say that even though we have a prevailing wage requirement on this project, that one casino has committed to hiring a City of Richmond resident and they have final agreements with LIUNA.  to hire some of our residents to work on this project. So there's a guarantee from that group, One Richmond, that we're going to have citizens of Richmond that are going to build that casino. Not only just build a casino, they're going to make money up way above the prevailing wages. And not just that, that they're going to have full benefits  retirement benefits and health benefits while building that casino. So we do support that project. And I want to say something that I think I want to something very historical that I think all of us should be very aware of. I was one of the three people when I happened to be at the General Assembly when this casino bill was passed. I happened to stumble upon that room that day.  And there were three people that objected to that because at the time the five licenses were issued, it was supposed to be just for the Pumonkey and Colonial Dance only. And I raised an objection to that on the grounds that they should allow the city of Richmond  you know, to choose whoever they want to choose. In particular, I was particularly offended by it because it was in February of last year, and I thought in Black History Month, you know, that they never give consideration to the Black collective.  They give to the Indians, and they give to other white folks. Now, this is what got us here today. And I'm saying that let's allow this organization. One Casino will be the first Black-owned casino in the country. We deserve to have one out of all the casinos being built all over the world, all over the country, and being reserved for everybody else. Kordish is going to be White-owned. One Casino is going to be Black-owned.  There's time for black world to be built and I will appreciate if you can let that make that happen. Now one last thing about about about there's an issue about about where there's some where there's experience. Now there's always going to be a first time. Nobody ever asked any white company when they want to do the first one, whether there's an issue of where they have experience.  One casino has a very reputable experienced partner in Colonial Downs. So I find it very offensive as a Black man that once a Black man is going to do something, everybody's crying about lack of experience. Even when you have a partner that has a strong experience to be with you. So this man has a good experience as CEO. We should let one casino build this.",Economic Development

I like the idea, and I'm sure that there are other folks out here that like the idea of Cordish providing jobs for some of our citizens, especially those that are sort of unemployed, marginally employed.  or less than employed, if you will. And so this is an opportunity that we can actually give them an opportunity when we keep talking about economic equity. So let's take that opportunity to do so, which is why I asked the city council to look at this project and not with their biases that are being presented and with the open eye and actually support the project for Cordes. Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. Allegiance.",Economic Development

My husband and I live in the museum district and we love Richmond. Tonight I am here to defend our vibrant local community and want to make a statement on jobs, impact on small businesses, and impact to our community.  Jobs, the Cordish company and council have touted jobs as the primary reason for this project. However, this includes a significant number of short term jobs that will quickly evaporate. Of those that remain, many will go to current Cordish employees brought in to open and manage the casino. Of the few jobs left, how many will actually go to Richmond residents who will bear the burden of this project?  Impact on small businesses. Cordish indicates they will be different than other casinos that have historically gutted communities and ruined small businesses. However, casino visitors only stay one and a half nights, and we know that these complexes are designed to keep people within their walls.  According to the Small Business Administration, when you spend $100 at a small business, $48 stays within the community. When spending the same at a big national company, only $14 stays within the community.  Furthermore, Kordish touts its 4,000 seat concert space. How does this differ from our current Altria Theater? How does creating another venue of similar capacity benefit our current local businesses and their employees? Finally, community impact.  As of earlier today, 14 neighborhood associations formally oppose the construction of this casino. The citizens of Richmond are not opposed to growth. We want growth that is consistent and compatible with our city's character.  Instead of believing the words of a company that has no root or commitment to the long-term viability of our community, I ask City Council to believe in its citizens who work, live, and invest in Richmond and made it what it is today. We built Richmond and we will defend Richmond. And I ask City Council to please consider opposing the casino project. Thank you.",Economic Development

Good evening. Thank you. I just wanted to speak in support of the one project because the project is bigger than the casino and the resort. It's about equity in the black and brown community. We don't have any sit down restaurants in the eighth districts.  We always have to go outside of our district to find a decent restaurant that we can patronize. So we're very excited about the opportunity for jobs, even if it's just short term.  It's an opportunity for people to work, to put food on the table, to pay bills, and to feel like they've done something that gives them a little dignity about themselves. Because a lot of times  People don't want to give you a job because of your background or your lack of experience. So I feel like this is an opportunity where people will have an opportunity to work, build equity in the community, as well as keeping some of those funds local. I mean, one is talking about 12 of Richmond's best restaurants and breweries.  in one location. That's money right here, local, where you don't have to travel outside of the city. So while we're excited about the resort that has games, music, and so much more, to me, the bonus is the opportunity to have jobs in the 8th District that's on the bus line when a lot of people don't have an opportunity to get back and forth to work using Uber,  or any of those other means of transportation. So we're excited about it, and we're excited to support the project in the 8th District.",Economic Development

Which means there's no new jobs in Southside, so it's a big to piggyback off of what everybody else so far has said.

More jobs will be focused towards minorities because there are a lot of people. Who are in like the subsidized housing and the?  Homeless people are very rampant in this area, and I think that will bring more economic opportunities to them because they will have more jobs here with the casino and the resort.

Speaking of coming from a single-family household like I was, we won't have that opportunity unless that was brought to our attention. And then it's going to bring money as far as storms, as when the roads are damaged to fix potholes. And if people are coming from out of state to come to the casino,  they probably won't come because of the damage that could possibly be done to their cars. And then also with the rich men having been lacking in entertainment, there's going to be a whole lot of big entertainers that's going to come who rich men normally doesn't see.

My name is Melvin Jones, and I'm a resident of the 3rd District. And my concern was that on May the 19th at 530, I encountered two young men driving down North Avenue, and they had a shootout at Hazelhurst and North Avenue.  And I had called 911 and didn't get a police response. But I understand they were having a protest going on in the city. And my next accountant was trying to call Henrico County, but they were having a graduation at the fairgrounds. So I went on about a week and hadn't anybody come around to pick up the gun shells that were on the ground. It was about nine millimeter gun shells on the ground. I had called the police department to try to get somebody to come over to get them.  So what I did, I went out there with an ink pen and a container and picked them up and took them to the 4th precinct on Chamberlain Avenue. And there was a lady in a cubicle over there, and she asked me, was there mines? I said, no, these were something that somebody was shooting out there. So she went and got a sergeant. And before that time, I said, well, if you can't get anything done, I'll go over to the headquarters and get something done. Because the remark that I got was kind of nasty. So...  You know, in the meantime, she went and got a sergeant and he took the shells. But in all my days, 22 years in the military and living in the city of Richmond, I never in my life, I thought I was watching a TV show. These guys got out of the car and I mean, they unloaded. Anytime I go up there the next week, it happened on the 19th. My dad was sitting in the backyard. You know, I support the Richmond Police Department 100%.  And I really wish that the city council and the mayor would give the Richmond Police Department whatever they need. Because I was really embarrassed the day when I saw on TV Henrico County paying their police officer $53,000 to start off. I mean, come on. We need to keep these good police officers that we got. And, I mean, I've never seen this in my life. And the other night, somebody unloaded an automatic out here. I mean, you could hear it.  And the man on the street, he said the same thing. He said, no, Mr. Jones, they won't fire our crackers. That was a semi-automatic. And, you know, we got to get these bad guns off the street. So we need to go back to these rolling roadblocks and stop this stuff. I mean, you know, it's just getting out of hand now. I mean, we're getting young kids shot in the city of Richmond.

We've been downtown for 22 years, raised five kids here. We finally have an empty nest, so we're really beginning to enjoy our front porch. But it's awful when you step out each morning, starting at 6.30 in the morning usually, the homeless have gathered in front of our house.  And it's gotten worse, right? So even prior to calling today, joining this call today, I reached out to the non-emergency number. I'm calling them frequently. Most of the time, you know, the officers' hands are tied because, you know, the homeless understand the laws and ordinance better than we do. So they're staying right across the street from my house and gather and make noise.  inappropriate behavior of all types.

I'm a lifelong Richmonder parent teacher and I'm deeply concerned about the climate crisis.  According to the IPCC, we're on track to emit the global carbon budget of 420 gigatons in six years and six months. Meanwhile, the words emissions and carbon did not appear in the most recent city budget. The word climate appeared once on page 97 as one goal under one priority.  If we're going to do the massive work of decarbonizing, we need these goals to be reflected in every budget and in all aspects of city decision-making for the foreseeable future. We need to declare a climate emergency, as Alexandria, Virginia did two years ago, and as 148 cities nationally and 23 nations already have, and use this declaration to educate and mobilize our city to meet this challenge with the urgency and honesty with which we're meeting  the challenge of the global pandemic. Also being introduced at tonight's meeting is an acknowledgement of racism as a public health emergency. Research continues to confirm how climate change disproportionately impacts communities of color. The climate emergency resolution being introduced tonight is explicit about the link between racism and climate impacts and the necessity of anti-racist climate policy.  I'm aware of and heartened by the city's green plan, but I did not see these commitments being put into action with the speed and scale that is called for by the scientific community. I'm also aware that the Office of Sustainability lacks the power and resources to implement this plan. As the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated, society can make seemingly impossible transformations very quickly when we publicly unite behind the science. It's also shown  us the deadly toll of scientific illiteracy, incompetence, and inaction. Thanks.",Environment and Sustainability

The impacts of climate change are no longer subtle. The onslaught of wildfires, heat waves, floods, droughts, tornadoes, and extreme weather are all around us and continually in our news cycle.

The resolution is a vision for the future and a blueprint for change, particularly as it relates to the modernization of the city, its policies and the enhancement of quality of life markers such as parks, green spaces and neighborhoods. But we must act urgently and with agency. With the introduction of this declaration, the city of Richmond is taking an important step forward and has become a leader in the country by addressing the climate emergency facing our world.  It's going to take the implementation of critical follow-up actions that address climate and racial justice to bolster the lives and the health of our residents. Green New Deal Virginia applauds Richmond City Council for leading the way forward on climate action that benefit all who live, work, and play in the River City. Richmond is laying the foundation for what a just and equitable transition to a green energy economy will look like for residents, while modeling real solutions for other localities  making the move to clean energy.

When it comes, when a citizen submits a complaint about police misconduct and a violation of their Fourth Amendment right, there needs to be a thorough internal affairs policy completely revised because it allows so many loopholes for harassment after a citizen will file a complaint on a Richmond police officer.  I have a quick thing I want to read right quick. Apologies, I've never done this before. Can you bear with me? I'm sorry. Our internal affairs policy discrepancies, all complaints should remain within internal affairs and should not be handled at a unit level. All officers, especially officers that have a complaint history, should be mandated to wear body cam equipment. There should be proper contact with complainant and results of disposition should be reported to the complainant at a reasonable time.  The current internal affairs policies has loopholes for corruption and harassment upon its complainees. Once an officer has so many civilian complaints, a thorough investigation should be done on that officer. Officers are conducting themselves in gang behavior, such as intimidation, unprofessional manners, abuse of power, etc. Who do you call to police the police? Thank you.",Police Reform

I can attest to the positive impact these green spaces will have on our community for years to come. 11 years ago, a group of community members and volunteers developed a plan that would serve as a guide  for the creation of the Bellmead Outdoor Learning Campus. We have removed invasive plants, added two acres of land to the park, created a bike shop, learning stations that consist of beehives, youth, rain, and pollination gardens, geology station, walking and biking trails, and a safe entry into Albro Creek. Our community youth meet every Saturday from 10 to 1 o'clock to focus on improving their reading and math skills.  They plant weed, water, and harvest the vegetables which they take home to their parents and enjoy other adventure activities in the park. A highlight of the summer when it's been 95 degrees is to try to keep them out of the creek. We consistently have 40 children ages 4 to 18 attending our Saturday program along with our high school and their sponsors.  We've been conducting the program for eight years, and because we conduct our program outdoors, we've been able to continue the program throughout the pandemic. We haven't missed a step. Many of our children stay with us year after year, and that accounts for the age spread. All our students that stay in our program are graduating from high school, attending specialty schools, including Maggie Walker, and are going on to attend and graduate from college.  In addition to our Saturday program, we have witnessed the transition of our park from primarily a two-month usage of the park for a football field, and now it is utilized every day, not only by our immediate community members, but visitors from surrounding counties.",Parks and Recreation

I'm a resident of the First District, president of the Richmond Building and Construction Trades Council, and the business manager for the Electrician's Union, IBEW 666. Here today to discuss opportunities for city residents that are presented in upcoming projects and the planning process that will utilize property currently owned by the city. Misclassification and wage theft is rampant in the construction industry, disproportionately affecting women and people of color.  Imagine you have all seen the high-profile projects in the news recently with allegations of misclassified workers and wage theft. Misclassification of workers takes tax dollars out of city and state coffers, cheats workers of protections like workers' compensation and unemployment insurance, and leads to reduced opportunity for city residents to participate in apprenticeship training.  Development by the city or on land the city sells to a developer should create jobs that pay a family-sustaining wage with benefits. Instead of a race to the bottom encouraging unscrupulous and illegal business practices, Richmond development should be providing training and apprenticeship opportunities to residents. As many of you know, there are tools available to Council passed in the 2019 General Assembly session.  I urge the council to consider the use of project labor agreements or community benefits agreements and prevailing wage requirements on upcoming development projects the city has a part in. Additionally, there are AFL-CIO funds that invest union capital in the development of affordable housing. There may be opportunities for those funds to partner with the city and or developers as the Coliseum Area Framework Plan is rolled out, as well as a redevelopment associated with the Diamond.

When reading the recommendations from the Task Force on Policing Reform, the word outrageous kept coming to mind. It is a good plan for a locality that has a large police department that is totally out of control and an outside entity is needed to take over and establish order. That locality is certainly not Richmond, Virginia.  The police did not do everything right during the unrest, but definitely should not be completely taken over by an outside dictatorship. And that is exactly what the task force is recommending. With the destruction of our city, the thefts and harassment of officials at their homes, there should have been many more arrests and convictions.  The type of model presented to us is not being used because it is a power grab on steroids and will cause more problems than it could ever solve. I suggest that two compliance officers, not members of the police department, be hired to investigate all complaints and be given any authority needed to do so.  They would also make sure that the police department follows all through on all of the rules and regulations and dispense all discipline in a timely manner. A secretary would also need to be hired to maintain the official paperwork and answer the telephone for the compliance officers. It is not necessary to spend $1.2 million to get the job done.  We need the police, but they can find a job somewhere else. Let us not put up roadblocks that become a detriment to our city.

Four years ago, a small group of anti-development activists called Library Green successfully amended the city's charter to preserve a downtown parking lot forever as a park. They promised the public that they would do this privately. It would be a project privately led, privately funded, and that it would be completed by the city's bicentennial.  The city has given Library Green a fair and full opportunity to deliver on what it said it was going to do. Four years to raise money, privileged access to council and staff, a city-funded task force, a dedicated advisory commission that exists entirely separate from the Parks Department, and critically, hundreds of thousands of dollars in city budget allocations. Few citizen-led,  Projects enjoy this kind of city support, and few organizations could have wasted that support more comprehensively. They haven't raised the money. They don't have a plan to do it. They haven't demonstrated to voters that they are capable of executing their vision or making any significant progress on that vision on any reasonable time scale, short-term, medium-term, long-term. The politics of housing and land use in Ann Arbor since the passage of Proposal A have shifted dramatically.  In the last two cycles, we've seen voters comprehensively reject the exclusionary anti-housing agenda that animated Proposal A's passage. Every council member who supported significant resource diversion to the project has lost their seat. Every year that goes by, under the status quo, they will continue to parasitically drain and waste staff time and resources,  They will cause the city and private organizations like Peter Allen's EA2, who's sitting behind me, they'll have to plan around this fiction. And the city, critically, is going to continue to lose millions of dollars in tax revenue, hundreds of units of housing, tens of millions of dollars in grants. Tomorrow I'm going to email all of you a draft resolution. It doesn't repeal Proposal A. It replaces it.  with a charter codified commitment to invest whatever we reap from the sale of that property to advance community consensus policy goals, to help the city. It also requires any purchaser that would come along to create and maintain the plaza that we were promised, the plaza that we would have today, absent the intervention of Library Green.  I'm speaking you tonight because I'm independently passionate about this issue. I was a taxpayer. I was a resident. I was not involved in city politics. This is something that really drew me in because of how indefensible and shocking it was. I believe it's time to ask voters this year, 2023, whether they want to continue throwing good money after bad. Thank you.",Governance and Civic Engagement

So this past Friday, the Ann Arbor Fire Department reported in a social media post that a pedestrian was struck on Jackson Avenue in front of Veterans Park and had been in critical condition after that. So I haven't seen, I don't think we have a full accounting of exactly what happened just yet, but I've been dreading this sort of situation for some time.  In fact, I spoke to council about pedestrian safety on Jackson Avenue back in September, and I said it was inevitable that somebody would be hurt or worse. I hate that I was apparently correct about this. I hate it. But here we are. So this location, Jackson, with Betts Park on one side and Burwood Avenue on the other, it's a high demand spot for pedestrian crossing across Jackson Avenue.  It connects a neighborhood to one of our city's premier parks, but there's no marked crosswalk no safe way to cross the street there. In fact, this is part of a stretch of Jackson Avenue over two thirds of a mile long without a single marked crosswalk without a single safe place to cross, even though there are bus stops all along here neighborhoods, there's convenience stores and of course there's parks so  You know, folks in the neighborhood along Jackson, and city staff too, to their credit, have actually been working for years to try to get some mid-block crosswalks added here, at least ever since the road diet was completed in 2015 on Jackson, if not for a lot longer before then. But so far, nothing's happened, because this is a state trumpline owned by the Michigan Department of Transportation, and MDOT just doesn't seem to care about anything except free-flowing car traffic, at least not until people die.  Adding a few crosswalks is the least they could do to improve pedestrian safety and access in this city, but they haven't done it for at least eight years now when people have been asking them for it. Now, I know this sort of situation is why the city is running a study looking at possibly taking control over these state routes. But the outcome of that study isn't a foregone conclusion, and it really won't come soon enough in any case. We need MDOT to add safe crossings on Jackson and West Huron  Now, immediately, as we have just seen, every moment of delay puts our neighbors and our community at further risk. You know, enough is enough.  So tonight, I'm speaking to you. I'm in a slightly weird position where I'm asking city council to take action on a problem, even though I know that you don't really have authority over it. Sorry about that. But still, I hope you will do everything you can to convince MDOT to finally solve this problem and to do so without delay. And I will also do what I can to contact them directly. And I hope everyone in the community who's watching this who cares about this issue will do the same. Thank you.",Transportation and Mobility

It's the Human Rights Commission of Ann Arbor in 2003 telling you, the city council, to pass a resolution against military aid to Israel. Look at it. Allow a vote on the resolution.  We are against military aid to Israel. We didn't make it up. We got it from the Human Rights Commission. Vote for it. You, the City Council, up until now, up until now, have broadcast to the world that Palestinians' lives are worth nothing to you while you pretend to be progressive.  You, the City Council, have let the world know that Palestinians have no rights that you are bound to respect. But the whole progressive base of your party, the whole progressive base of your party, has already moved decisively over to supporting Palestinian human rights. Don't you know that?  We are no longer in 1857 when the Supreme Court ruled that black people have no rights which the white man is bound to respect. Similarly, we are no longer in a time when you can call yourself a progressive and say that Palestinians have no rights that you are bound to respect.  while you pour billions of dollars of military aid into the apartheid state of Israel. Don't even pretend you're progressive unless you say something about that. Beware of hitching your wagon to the violent, racist state of Israel. Israel, who you remember,  is a hardcore supporter for many years of apartheid South Africa. Even if you, like Iyer, took campaign money from old friends of the Israel Defense Forces, even if you did, you really ought to allow a vote on the seven-word resolution that's been in front of you for so long  Ready?

For 40 years, I've owned the property adjacent to and south of the 530 development. I lived at the property for eight years and started my family there and would like to return to live there sometime. I ask that the PUD not be granted.  I think it is clear that if an 8,000 square foot house can be net zero, then a 4,000 square house with the same solar footprint will also be net zero and meet the city's energy and density goals. Mr. Shelby claims to be a builder, carpenter, and landlord and has owned for 45 years.  for 20 years, the 3,333 square foot building at 530 North Division Street. I think Mr. Shelby describes the building as collapsing. It appears that the structure will end up in the landfill. I don't think the city should award a landlord that fails to maintain his building with a PUD.  Also, what are the consequences if energy predictions don't materialize? Will the city triple his property taxes? Will he be made to remove one of the units for the structure in compliance then with RC4 zoning? Or will he just pass the extra energy cost on to tenants and laugh all the way to the bank with his  140% increase in profit. I am unaware that private businesses under any obligation to share accurate energy information with the city or anyone.  Private businesses, to my knowledge, are not under the Freedom of Information Act. Likewise, I do not think he's under any obligation to install any energy savings equipment in the building. And if it is not available or is too expensive at the time of construction, or keep it maintained once installed, he can just pass the high energy costs on to the tenants.  I bought into RC4 zoning 40 years ago and I do not want those rights stolen from me when this new building, this new house is built. I ask that you deny the PUD. Thank you.",Housing

First,  Congratulations and respect to the powerful people of Iran who are fighting for human rights and dignity every night. I am with you. People of conscience are with you. And anybody who gives a shit about human rights is with you.  I have been coming to human rights commissions in Ann Arbor, to city council in Ann Arbor, demanding human rights and human dignity for people of Palestine, who are the target of U.S. military aid to Israel. They've been getting killed by Israeli military day in and day out.  Just about every day for the past 30, 40, 50, 60 years, Palestinians have been getting killed. I've been coming here demanding human rights for Palestinian people. When I first arrived in Ann Arbor, I really thought this was a progressive group because they had a human rights commission. And me and multiple people like myself, we went to their meetings and we pushed them to pass this resolution, which Blaine just talked about.  pass a resolution against human, against military aid to Israel. And finally in December, January of 2004, they did pass that resolution and it made it into the media. You have a copy of it to look at. I invite all of you to look at it and read it carefully. They passed that resolution. That resolution never made it to the tables of this  fantabulous city council and those like it, it never made it to them to vote on it. Because what happened is that corruption and Zionist lobby in this town won. And they stopped it from getting into the hands of the Ann Arbor City Council members.  It is time that you vote on that. Instead of voting on that resolution, Ann Arbor City Council replaced the commissioner's chairperson, eliminated its staff, and changed its staff so that they would vote the right way, the way of Zionist pigs in this town.  I am asking you again, those of you who have just arrived, you have the chance to do the right thing. If you don't use your opportunity to stand with people of Palestine and vote for this resolution that says we are against military aid to Israel, if you don't use your chance and you do the right thing, I will be yelling and screaming at you the same way I'm yelling and screaming at the rest of these killers. I would be counting you in with them.  Choose rightly. Vote for Palestinian human rights and do the right thing before I call you a racist pig like I call our mayor every time I come here. He has proven to be a racist pig. That's why I call him. He's got a record. He cannot sue me. Ms. Ayer is leaving because she can't stomach it.

I came to U of M School in 1971 to take seven really valuable courses in business, architecture, urban planning graduate programs. My favorite course was with Norbert Gorwick in urban planning. At every class, he would show us his personal travel pictures of the great cities of the world.  Professor Growick made a huge difference on me, so much so that I stayed in Ann Arbor to pursue my real estate career and raise my family, having fallen in love with its walkable urbanity, nearby parks, and the amazing Huron River. I started teaching real estate development at the University in 1980 as a side pursuit to my development. I retired last winter from teaching over 40 years and 4,000 students, including Jeff Gahan, Lisa Suave, Wanwu Li, Hilary Hansel to name just a few of those at City Hall.  One of my best and last students, Sarah Lorenz, and I co-founded a non-profit, Equitable Ann Arbor Land Trust in 2019 to offer creative and bold housing solutions due to Ann Arbor's lack of housing at all the middle and lower price points. Here are EA2's recommendations. First, step for step, expand park land uses and activities near the riverfront.  expand the new 22 million dollar funded Lowertown Riverfront Conservancy to help with new passive active cultural recreational  and educational opportunities. Open the river views by culling all the invasives. Expand the bike and walking trails out into the nearby neighborhoods along the creek sheds. Enhance and transform the 2.5 mile stretch of river into the defining characteristic of Ann Arbor, as renowned as the big house is to the university. Use the river to stitch together the town and gown. Make this new riverfront a birthday present to our citizens for the next 200 years.  Step two, motivate the city and university to transform their well-located service parking lots into mixed-use housing over retail. Place these public sites into community land trusts with 99-year leases. Develop them with affordable workforce and market rate housing for sale rather than rental wherever possible.  Local retail and new parking would be added where necessary. The eight large parking lots for the housing solution are all located within the five oxbows from Argo Pond to the Arboretum. Can you imagine where any of them are? Two sites are owned by the city. The rest are mostly owned by the university.  Tonight, I'd like to introduce six talented U of M seniors and their faculty advisor, Christina Eckhoff. Stand up, folks. They will all be doing their three-credit capstone class this term to help the EA2 unravel the details and complexities for our agenda. This capstone team will be researching best practices across the country on how to promote Ann Arbor's riverfront renaissance.  This will be for a fully explained article by Ryan Stanton later on this week. Thank you very much. I've got a handout for each of you as well. Appreciate it. Thanks a lot.",Urban Development

Casey Klein, 3304 North Timberwood Drive, Traverse City, Michigan 49686. I would like to address agenda item C1 regarding the proposed new development at 530 North Division Street, which would include the removal of the 3,000 square foot structure to be replaced with an 8,000 square foot recertified structure.  I grew up next door at 524 North Division Street, where my family continues to be stewards of this historic property today. One of the responsibilities of the city is to set and maintain standards, and this project falls well outside the current standards. When a variance is allowed, it sets a precedent. If the city's intent is to start changing this neighborhood, then those changes should be a part of a larger master plan and approved by the citizen.  not piecemeal together as will happen if this proposal moves forward without substantial modifications. During the Planning Commission meeting, I heard one of the commissioners ask about adding a maximum setback  and another about adding restrictions for maximum height. That only added to my concern that there is no clear or set plan moving forward in this neighborhood. I believe the proposed construction should be at a minimum contained to the existing footprint, if not in total size, scale, and historical exterior finishes, in order to maintain the characteristics of this unique neighborhood.  The only thing to be gained by building a structure as large as what is proposed is to make money, and that is not the city's responsibility to ensure that that happens. New construction within the existing footprint would be a win-win in my eyes, as it would maintain the current look and feel of the neighborhood, could still achieve the goals of LEED certification, and be designed for more dense occupancy. Even when a project checks all the boxes,  It does not always mean it is the right thing to do. The Old Fourth Ward was not developed at an energy-saving district, but a historical one, and future planning for this area should take that into consideration. During a previous Planning Commission meeting, I heard Mr. Shelby acknowledge the history of the neighborhood and noted no Native American presence in this area. If the proposal moves forward without substantial modification to the footprint, please consider requiring an archeological survey of the site prior to development.  This neighborhood is one area close to downtown that is protected from university development. Every time I pass the corner where the Flimsy Burger location used to be, my heart sinks a little. I miss the quaint gateways downtown. The looming building that replaced this structure, which contributed to that faint feeling, does not fit the site and look out of place. While it is beautifully designed, it does not fit the site or characteristics adjacent to it.  While that structure is much larger than what's proposed by 30 Division Street, it gives an example of the way that one structure can change the entire look and feel of an area. Thank you for your time and consideration.",Urban Development

I'm a resident of Upper Lowertown. I'm a former health care worker at the University of Michigan. That was about 30 years ago or so. But in terms of CA1 and CA2, I support pedestrian and bicyclist infrastructure.  and hope to see more of that occur around the city, but including this problematic intersection and bridge. When I was working at U of M, these were always treacherous crosswalks.  OK, treacherous, no matter what time of day or night. Now, the university, if they want what they want, they should pay more for what they want, OK, and not be subsidized by the Ann Arbor taxpayers.  And in terms of CA9, I support this proposal, this action, and like when developers put forward affordable housing options. I think this is the best course moving forward.  What I really wanted to talk about was the library lot. And I wanted to echo some of Dan Adams's commentary from a few weeks ago and the proposals that he is pushing forward. And I will also be writing some email to city council expressing my views on what should happen with the library lot.  I think that Ann Arbor City Council should put forward proposals to either modify or replace the amendment to the city charter from 2018 and I I'm a fan of  putting money and effort into improving Liberty Plaza because that is our commons too. The library is our commons. Kemp House is our commons too.  And if we spin our wheels constantly, I mean, I've been an observer of the center of the city and the library, conservancy, et cetera, et cetera, meetings.

I'm on the board of Walk Like Washtenaw, but we haven't had a time to put together an organizational statement on your latest proposals before you tonight.  It's been interesting to follow the progress of this project, the sad progress over the last year. Walk Like Washington has tried to represent the public interest and tried to represent what's in Ann Arbor's and the university's non-motorized transportation plans and carbon neutrality plans. So far we haven't been successful, but we hope to be. The earlier statement, I hope you had a chance to look at what I sent you earlier today.  The WBWC statement from about a year ago talked about what's needed. Widening the west sidewalk on the bridge by about five feet and building the long planned trail loop under the bridge. Widening the sidewalk would allow room for bi-directional bike lanes and a pedestrian lane as an important part of a campus-to-campus bike route if we ever want to make a safe route between the campuses for biking.  However, a council by a 65 vote about a year ago directed the designer to proceed with a bad design, which would actually narrow the west sidewalk from 10.5 feet to 8 feet. Now you've been presented with a proposal which, as I understand it, would narrow it from 10.5 feet to 10 feet. So it's less bad, but it's still not good. And it's not what's needed.  One thing that I'm confused about in the proposal before you is the cost issue. It would authorize $2 million to widen the bridge by two feet, as I understand it. We were told about a year ago that it was estimated to cost about half a million dollars to widen it by five feet because of the need for an extra support beam. So it seems odd that we'd be paying more for less, paying three times as much for  or four times as much for less than half as much widening. So that ought to be clarified, what the issue with the cost is there. Also before you, as I understand it, the city would be paying the first 500,000, first half million, and then the university would pick up any additional one and a half million up to $2 million. If that's right, and if it turns out that the cost is only about a half million, then the city has been taken to the cleaners on this deal. I think you ought to look into that cost issue.  You know, we're on the verge of making a $10 million mistake on a long-term investment here when really we should do it right. And if we can't do the bridge right on a long-term investment like this, we should reject this proposal until we can do the design right and build it right. Thank you.",Transportation and Mobility

And this year's award goes to Council Member Erica Briggs. Erica came to my attention about five years ago as she applied for the position of Executive Director of Scenic Michigan. And I was very concerned when she applied because I looked at her resume.  And her resume showed that she was a community activist. She was involved in biking, not the Hell's Angel type, but in biking. She was a runner. She was a camper. She was a cook. She was a traveler. She was a mother and a wife and an academic, having completed her master's and was working on her PhD.  But as it said, if you want a job to get done, give it to a busy person. And we did. And I'm very glad that we did. During her time as executive director, Erica monitored state and federal litigation.  the lawsuits that are filed by the billboard companies against municipalities that regulate the billboards and signs. She participated in developing of local ordinances and state legislation. She spread the word about Scenic Michigan in person, in the media, and electronically.  and she organized and promoted our Scenic Michigan photo contest.",Urban Development

We're calling in about C1. And I hope you've all read the very thorough report. So I just want to make a mention from page 19 of that report about the Robert and Irma Hayden House Historic District.  The Robert and Irma Hayden House Historic District Study Committee finds that the proposed Historic District, Robert and Irma Hayden House Historic District, sounds redundant, has significant under National Register of Historic Places, Criterion B, as it illustrates the lives of persons significant in our past within a local, state, or national historic context.  I support this and hope that you'll vote in favor of this. We do have some other single resource districts within our city, Northern Brewery, Cobblestone Farm come to mind. This is a wonderful way to recognize, not just preserve, but recognize architecture and people and the history of our community. We have our bicentennial coming up in 2024. So I'm hoping that there'll be some other recognition similar to this  that will be highlighted as part of that as well. And by the way, I was on the Historic District Commission for six years, Chair for two, and on the Board of Cobblestone Farm for two years. So I speak from that perspective, but I speak here supporting this as an individual person.  I'd also like to thank the last caller for their remarks on that particular item. I believe two items, maybe. And I also want to speak about CA9. And I suggest that you pull this for discussion from the consent agenda. I'm not against it, but I think the discussion of it would be valuable to everybody. We have a $2 million contribution to the Affordable Housing Fund as part of the TUD, and they're looking  actually have 15 units on site, which would be the right math, I'm guessing. And the question is, as a community, what do we prefer? Do we prefer to have the units on site when we have these type of developments, or do we prefer the money paid in lieu? Rather than me telling you right now, I think the discussion  Should be opened up and let's hear from you and it probably is an ongoing discussion Recently announced was the five corners PUD a state and package and they're going to be paying a few million dollars affordable housing fund So if we'd rather have the units on site or not, that's the 30 seconds and some and something that's a community and you as our representatives I should be communicating with the developer about I  People know from my past speeches that I am a proponent of flexible development options, including but not limited to PUDs. So I look forward to having actual affordable housing units built on site at this development. And then the best decisions made at some of the other PUDs in terms of where the money goes to actual units being built or to the affordable housing fund, which can be leveraged.",Urban Development

Tell me, would you pay the extra $100,000, 50% higher, assuming, of course, you can afford it? If not, why should we? If the spread was close, it makes sense, but not 50%. On the Bailey contracts, unlike the typical multiple bids on large contracts of this type, this time Bailey was the only bidder. Last year, if you remember, Council Members Iyer and Rodina twice convinced you  to override staff recommendations to hire lower bidders in favor of Bailey. Two well-established local contractors with lots of past city jobs have said since they might not even spend the time and dollars working up bids if this process like that continues to be used. I can't blame them. And now it looks like no one wants to even compete with Bailey. So it appears in less than a year, implementation of best value has resulted in potential  much higher bids, $1.6 million, $2.5 million on an annual basis, and has completely eliminated competitive bidding of the work that Bailey likes to do.

The four contracts described in my email illustrate how flawed implementation of our best value policy has already potentially wasted almost $1.6 million in just eight months.  over competing qualified lower bids and appears to have chilled competitive bidding. This is real money. Failure to ask hard questions would be the height of fiscal irresponsibility. Ask yourself this, what are we getting for that $1.6 million? I recognize the community voted to approve best value. I had mixed feelings about it then and unfortunately it looks like some problems raised then have now occurred. It's your responsibility to deal with them. Look at the CA Hall contract. It's $755,000, three quarters of a million.  Higher than the low bid. Staff's using a five-factor scoring system for awarding contracts. I'll leave aside for now the issue of weighting items like worker development equally with cost and qualifications. Let's look at the detail. TA Hall scored 83, the lower bidder 80. That small scoring difference was a four-point difference in social equity and sustainability.  Ask this, what was that based on? Then ask, what are we getting for that $755,000? There might be good answers, but those questions need to be asked. Next, look at the August 837,000 AZ-SHMINA contract, 279,000 higher, 50% higher than the low bid. AZ scored 74, the other bidder 67.

C1 on your agenda is likely your most important rezoning vote all year.  It will make the village project a by right development for planning commission approval. So if you want to see changes, now's the time between now and second reading. My view is this, Ann Arbor needs the housing and Robertson Brothers is a reputable builder. But this is a plan for 1993, not 2023. This developer is stuck in what economists refer to as status quo bias.  It does not grasp that the climate emergency dictates that we do everything differently, including construction. The village's for sale homes will be all electric, but the apartments, there will be 320 with more planned, will have gas heat. This directly conflicts with strategy two, action one of the 820 plan, which includes the following assumption, quote, all new residential and commercial buildings are designed and built to operate without the use of natural gas, end quote.  And strategy three, action two, quote, all new construction from 2022 to 2030 and beyond is built to net zero energy standards, which includes no natural gas consumption, end quote. Our Office of Sustainability and Innovations reviewed the village last July and wrote this, quote, the use of fossil fuels in any capacity goes against the goals of 820, end quote.  I calculate that the village's 320 apartments will produce 2,064 metric tons a year CO2 equivalent emissions just from burning gas. That almost cancels out the 2,446 metric tons a year that the city's Enerlogix solar at city facilities project will prevent. Gasoline savings from converting commuters to village residents will help, but will only offset about one fifth the damage.  We're told the apartments will be electrification ready, which means that they'll have a 220-volt panel for when it's time to replace the furnace. But gas furnaces have a 15- to 20-year lifetime. We can't wait that long for them to fail. And a heat pump for furnace swap often won't work because ducted systems are inefficient. The affordability versus sustainability narrative is a false one. Look at the apartment project at 1815 North Maple. It achieves both.  A Robertson Brothers consultant wrote that tenant utility bills would be 20% to 30% higher at the village with electric heat. But they used DTE's October 2021 gas rate of $0.67 per therm. That rate is now $0.89, or 33% higher, while electric rates are the same. The operating cost advantage for gas over high efficiency heat pumps is gone, at least for now. Tighter buildings with rooftop solar would ensure affordability.

Public comment making good progress miss dig and permit submitted working to expedite permit with city staff if all goes well We may be able to start work Wednesday or Thursday weather permitting this is regarding the mid-block crosswalk on  Fuller, that was a site of a fatality in 2016. I stood at this podium three or four times and begged the city to address the lack of lighting. The closest streetlight was 132 feet away. When the child was killed, the driver was not found at fault because a driver could not have reasonably seen the child in the crosswalk. I submitted a ticket on January 9th of this year after  The lights had been out for some time. Now we are getting to the point of contacting Mystic. I'm not going to go into all the details, but it is unconscionable for the city of Ann Arbor to not refer street lighting and illumination of crosswalks to the Transportation Commission. For some reason, it belongs to some other department somewhere that seems to be called Kathy Griswold.  We have to address this. So tonight I'm talking about DC one resolution to commence.  a collaborative planning process regarding the bridge. Obviously, we weren't collaborating and planning until certain people arrived on council. But anyway, given the projected cost increase of over $2 million, we need to look at this from a historical perspective and in the context of the greater need for pedestrian and cycling infrastructure in this community, especially crosswalk illumination.  So while we're working on tweaking this bridge one more time, we have hundreds of street lights that are out and hundreds, if not thousands, of crosswalks without optimal lighting, which is positive contrast lighting. So I've already talked about what's happened at Huron High School.  The DTE executive believes that it's two circuits that are connected to at least 35 lights. And these circuits, underground circuits, get damaged from all the development and digging and whatever we're doing. And so they may have to restring lighting. In conclusion, I was going to talk a lot more about the University of Michigan and how we're collaborating with them right now, but I'll save that  please light our crosswalks.",Transportation and Mobility

On January 27, parts of the world celebrated International Holocaust Remembrance Day. Actually, that was just the official day of remembrance. The real Remembrance Day is every day of the year, and if you don't believe that, merely create for yourself a Google alert on the word Holocaust.  The reason for this daily reminding is to fix forever in people's minds the eternal suffering and innocence of the Jewish people. Tonight, I'd like to focus on this alleged Jewish innocence, the innocence that is programmed into our minds by Hollywood, the media, campus, statues, and museums throughout America. We are taught that National Socialists of Germany wished to exterminate the Jews for no other reason than that they were Jews.  We are taught that Jews did nothing to deserve this alleged extermination and were like innocent lambs being led to slaughter. But maybe in 1933, Jews were not as innocent as we were led to believe. The headline of the March 24th edition of London's Daily Express read, Judea declares war on Germany. Jews in all the world unite in action. From the body of the article,  The Jewish wholesaler will quit his house, the banker his stock exchange, the merchant his business, and the beggar his humble hut in order to join the holy war against Hitler's people. And this international call to boycott really was against the German people. Jewish elites knew that the boycott would cause the starvation, the deaths of 30% of Germany's population.  A Jewish newspaper called Nasha Resch wrote, the war against Germany will be waged by all Jewish communities, conferences, congresses, by every individual Jew. Thereby, the war against Germany will ideologically enliven and promote our interests, which require that Germany be wholly destroyed.  Samuel Untermyer, president of the World Jewish Economic Federation, spewed falsehoods in his hate-driven speeches designed to whip up support for this Jewish-led boycott. He said, Germany has been converted from a nation of culture into a veritable hell of cruel and savage beasts. But in fact,  This economic war by Jews against Germany in 1933 occurred long before there was any such thing as sanctions or reprisals of any kind against European Jews. Innocent or warlike, as the Ann Arbor News said today, the past rediscovered. Thank you.",Israel-Palestine

When my husband, my ex-husband, John Sinclair, got out of jail after two and a half years, he started  back where he left off before he went to jail, and that's promoting music, managing bands, and he organized the 1972 and the 1973 Blues and Jazz Festivals in Ann Arbor, which were a great success and set the standard for festivals all in the country in terms of booking.

So the people of the cannabis culture community, whether it's medical or recreational, have spent and lost too much time in their homes hiding, in a car, behind a building. There isn't many events besides the hash bash over the years leading up to legalization.  This is one of the places where it's like a family reunion. We all meet family, friends, we talk about what's going on in the community, what are we gonna do for the next year, and how are we gonna structure the legalization, the recreational, and the medical all together to come together. A lot of the cannabis money that's given to the state of Michigan and to Ann Arbor  is from these stores. These stores are going to be on the Monroe Street Fair. They're the ones there supporting and giving them, the people, the community, education, the knowledge. I come from a place where I had a family member hurt in a car accident, filled him with drugs from the hospital.  If it wasn't for cannabis, this person wouldn't walk. So we need to be able to have a place where we can all meet and rejoice and, shoot, have a place to get together. Ann Arbor has always been the structured place. I've lived here for 40 years. This has been the place. Whether there's a permit or not, like this gentleman said, the people are coming. And there's nowhere for them to use the bathroom.

I was a vendor at the street fair last year, and I'm here to speak in support of granting the street fair permit. I think it's important to remember the history of the street fair. The street fair started about 20 years ago to address a very real issue, and that issue was the lack of infrastructure at the Hash Bash. Specifically,  the ability to wash your hands, cleaning up afterwards, subsidizing the police and fire response, as well as just, you know, kind of generally cleaning up at the end, because they clean it up every single year. And that is something that  You know, I think the hash bash needs. The hash bash is going to happen regardless if the street fair happens. The hash bash and the street fair, in most people's minds, there's no distinction. It is one in the same. You take away the street fair, those 10, 15,000 people are still going to show up to the hash bash. Then the question becomes, if they're at the hash bash, they got to use the bathroom, where are they going to go?  And the answer is twofold. One, they go to the local restaurants and they cause a nuisance. And we know because there's a lot of complaints before the street fair about that. Or number two, I mean, they use the city as a sewer. And they go wherever it is convenient for them. And I don't think that's good for anyone involved.  I do want to also address the public safety concern. Because that was brought by the police and it was brought by fire. And I believe it's unfounded. I believe not having the street fair is actually going to cause public safety concerns. Because you have 10,000, 15,000, 20,000 highly intoxicated 20-somethings. And if we don't close off those streets,  I'd rather have them in the streets without cars than in a street with cars because these people are not, you know, sober and they may not make great decisions. And I think it would be a lot better for everyone if we did close off those streets. So what I'm saying is, if you deny the street fare permit,  I believe it's going to cause the very issues that the city and fire are saying are going to happen if you actually grant it. It's going to cause public safety concerns. It's going to cause nuisances to nearby residents. It's going to cause a big mess that the street fair isn't going to be around to clean up this year. And, you know,  It's bad for the community. I mean, it's something where people are going to need these services, and they're going to go to hash bash. So then the question for you is, are you going to allow them to have it, or are you going to deny the permit, and people won't have a place to go to the bathroom, wash their hands? And so for those reasons, I'd suggest you grant the permit.",General Community Organizing

I've ridden over the East Medical Center Bridge for decades now to get to my job, to get to meetings on North Campus, to get to the pool when my kids were smaller, to get to robotics practice, and yes, to get to the Songbird Cafe to meet with city council candidates. I ride my bike across that bridge, but nobody else I know does. I don't know if any of you all have ever ridden your bikes across that bridge, but it's  Not good. I don't blame anyone who doesn't do it today because it wasn't built for people like me to ride a bike across it. It was built by your long ago colleagues for people to drive in cars and buses across it.  And so, of course, that's what people do today, because the decision they made 40 years ago that we were going to ride in vehicles across that bridge has haunted us for 40 years. And I say haunted, because I do ride my bike across it. And it's not safe today. It's not safe to cross across the lanes. It's not safe to ride in the lanes of 35 mile per hour traffic. But I've never come and complained to any of you about that, because I know that we can really only afford to rebuild bridges at end of life.  end of life, like Broadway and Stadium once were, where when we rebuilt them, we made sure they met multimodal needs. So I, you know, sucked it up, told my family I'd be careful, not to worry, that I would come home at the end of the day and gone out day after day over that bridge.  And now, the bridge is at end of life, and so you all get to rebuild it. And now is the time. Now is your time to make a change. It's the time to make that choke point welcoming for cyclists, especially those who, unlike me, are too intimidated today to ride across it. Perhaps some of you feel that way.  It's 12 minutes to North Campus. Not one of my U of M colleagues that I know of has ever ridden their bike to North Campus. Besides me, I'm sure there are some. They're just not common, at least in the offices I've worked in. I know that fixing this bridge won't fix the whole route, but you can't fix the whole route today. But this is your only chance to fix this choke point. Because now is the time, and it's the only chance in what's left of my lifetime.  So I'm frustrated to hear that the plan for it is no dedicated cycling infrastructure. Let me repeat that. No cycling infrastructure.  The current plan is for cyclists, like me, to ride in the road. Or to dismount in the center of the road with the traffic around us and haul our bikes up onto that sidewalk. A sidewalk where there is no room for us, even as guests under our policy, because the pedestrian traffic is so heavy.  There's no way that the new e-bikes that I'm sure you all are excited to hear may be coming to Ann Arbor can safely ride in that sort of traffic of the sidewalk today without endangering the pedestrians. I hope that means I have 30 seconds left. Okay, I have old closure. It was really great. Thank you everyone. See ya.",Transportation and Mobility

As someone who's been coming to the Hash Bash since the early days before the fair, I remember what it was like back then. And you know, having to beg to use a bathroom or beg to get a drink of water. So frankly, I feel that  It really, since the Monroe Street Fair has been there, it's added and it's made things safer. It gives the people that are gonna come anyway somewhere to congregate afterwards rather than they're out bothering businesses.  You know, it gives people, again, it's a really positive environment as well as, you know, stepping up. It gives some of the businesses that are, you know, in the cannabis field a way to advertise. And again, it's just a good scene. It's a tradition now. The street fair's been going on for 23 years.  It just seems silly to stop something when we all know it's not a problem.

What you're deliberating tonight has been characterized as a bridge project, but at its core, it is a road widening. Widening a road, whether or not it adds lanes, increases the speed of the road. Faster driving means exponentially more human injuries. And of course, inviting more injuries contradicts your Vision Zero commitment to zero deaths and serious injuries by 2025. The discussion highlights three things that should be worrisome to anyone concerned about road safety.  One, you're debating among choices that will increase car speeds. Two, these choices made their way through staff to your packet in the first place. And three, this is just the latest in a series of examples of how your Vision Zero commitment is somehow not being communicated to or carried out by staff. Recent examples include the Lower Town Mobility Study, a tremendously expensive study that, despite referencing Vision Zero and carbon neutrality, was described by staff as addressing car congestion and was largely car-focused.  Platt Road. The plan to resurface Platt was going to leave it as a dangerous four-lane road. Thankfully, you directed staff to correct this. Huron Parkway. Staff recommended and you approved the resurfacing of Huron Parkway that also keeps it four lanes, maintaining highway speeds through a high school crosswalk where children have been injured. Just like with Platt, please direct staff to correct this. The Fuller and Maiden intersection. Designs were circulated last year that showed adding turn lanes and slip lanes.  How is it that any staff or consultant resources are being used for this? A Vision Zero approach might start by questioning why Polar Road has four dedicated car lanes in the first place, not how to widen it. And now the bridge. So we see a pattern. Why does this keep happening? Why wasn't staff's first instinct to remove lanes on this bridge or add cycling infrastructure? The traffic volume on the bridge is about half of that of South Main Street, where we removed lanes and saw dramatically reduced speeding. Was it U of M's money?  Is any amount of money worth endangering everyone using a road or its sidewalks? What if U of M offered $5 million for a redesign of Fuller and Maiden Lane so they can ram through thousands more cars to their new parking structure? Despite what U of M wants, the Cars First mentality in City Hall needs to end now so we can move forward. My request tonight with the bridge, specifically, is for you to direct staff to create a new design that removes the car lanes and increases the bike and pedestrian infrastructure.  In the broader picture, I ask four things. One, reaffirm your commitment to literally zero deaths and serious injuries by 2025, not fewer deaths and injuries than most of Michigan. Two, direct staff to do road diets by default, so proposals like this never come before you again. Three, remove regressive policies like the so-called neighborhood feedback veto process for sidewalks, traffic calming, and removing parking.  And four, institute other Vision Zero friendly policies like a roundabout first policy and prohibiting the use of car level of service and staff analysis. You're going to spend about a billion dollars over the next two years. Please follow the lead of many cities in the U.S. Thank you. Zero commitment. Thank you.",Transportation and Mobility

So to start off, I found it interesting that at the last meeting, former council member Griswold spoke at public comment, among other things, expressing concern that reworking the plans for East Medical Center Drive Bridge to include adequate pedestrian and bike accommodations might add $2 million to the project cost.  And in some ways, I find this concerning too. But let's take a moment and consider why this is and how we got here. Nearly half of the estimated cost, not counting the contingency fund, is for a rework of the engineering plans that were completed over the last year. This means that had the previous council, including Council Member Griswold, as well as a few of you,  actually chosen to aggressively pursue a design that adequately accommodated all transportation modes, much of this additional cost could have been avoided. Or to put it another way, if we had had the current membership of city council a year ago, it might have saved the city and the university hundreds of thousands of dollars in a year of delay on this project. Better not for hypotheticals.  Main point is we should not fall prey to the sunk cost fallacy here. We will, as previous commenters said, have to live with this bridge for generations. So it's important, and it is worth paying the cost to get it right to the greatest extent we possibly can.  So I do want to offer sincere thanks to some of the folks on council and to Mr. DeHoney for this time standing up for the state of values of the city and getting us this far. Speaking before you in December, I characterized the previous bridge design as a capitulation. Now at least we can say it's a compromise. But it really is just that, a compromise.  We are compromising our city's goals and values by allowing a roadway to be widened to increase traffic volumes, speeds and potential conflicts. When we have adopted plans and objectives to do the opposite, we have objectives to reduce fatalities and serious injuries to zero and to cut our city's total vehicle miles traveled in half. We cannot do this. We cannot achieve any of this if we're going to keep on widening roads.  So in case you can't tell, I'm not exactly happy with the plan that's before you tonight. But I also recognize that this might be it, right? So my ask for you is first, please continue to keep a careful eye on transportation needs in the wider vicinity of this bridge, in the Fuller East Medical Center intersection. It's a critical linchpin in multiple biking and walking routes through the city.  There's a redesign of this intersection potentially coming down the road, so to speak, one which could be even more disastrous for these safety and sustainability goals if we do it wrong. And meanwhile, progress has not been made on long-planned pedestrian and bike underpass connections here for 40 years now.",Transportation and Mobility

My immediate family has taken five degrees from the University of Michigan, so we're familiar with the surroundings. When my wife and I were married here in 1953, do the math,  We went to Hawaii to raise our family. And when we retired from Hawaii in 1993, 30 years ago, we thought about California and Oregon as places to retire.  But we came to Ann Arbor. We found that we had been spending our off time in the summers trading houses with people in Ann Arbor. And they loved to trade houses with somebody who lived in Honolulu. So we settled in Ann Arbor 30 years ago, and we bought a house on the west side. And we have really enjoyed living here.  But in the recent years, we have had some misgivings about that. And I'd just like to raise a couple of issues. Our quality of life seems to have been declining here.  And one of the reasons we found was that there is traffic congestion now. There are more potholes as a result. There are high-rises going up, and there are vintage houses and vintage trees coming down to accommodate them. We find that the city council is really instrumental in this because they're offering gift  well, gift offerings of numerous sorts, but mainly of rezoning properties so that they can be developed upon. And in the long run, we have a feeling that the city council is really instrumental in this.  We have read recently in the New Yorker magazine that the city of Austin in Texas has made its city council into an instrument of profit making for developers and contractors.

What you may not know is that same Ann Arbor Human Rights Commission was pushing for virtually the same resolution that we've been pushing for all these years.  to speak against military aid to Israel. The Ann Arbor Human Rights Commission was pushing for that in 2003 at the city council. And the city council fiercely, fiercely turned a cold shoulder to them, took away their staff, flushed out their director, and to this day it's still not the same Human Rights Commission.  everyone and everything that you respect, you end up ditching, you end up ditching if they support Palestinian human rights. Exhibit A, Mayor Pro Tem Travis Radina was praising former Ann Arbor City Council member Kathy Kozachenko, the first LGBTQ open and out member of the Ann Arbor City Council.  She was that and much, much more. She pushed like crazy for Palestinian rights. And as soon as Radina found out about that, you stopped hearing her name pass his lips ever again. You stopped seeing any tweets from him about Councilmember Kozachenko ever again. When an institution or a person supports Palestinian human rights,  You ditch them like a hot potato. And for over 20 years, this whole Ann Arbor City Council has devoted enormous amounts of time and effort to making sure no Palestinian rights resolution would ever be debated by the city council. Is that anything other than racism? Is there some other name you would use for that other than racism? And that's setting aside the fact which you can't set aside.  that Israel was for years an intimate, close ally of apartheid South Africa because they were the same. None of that has moved you. None of that.  You have exerted so much effort to make sure that there's no debate of this simple seven-word resolution. We are against military aid to Israel. While Israel keeps gunning down Palestinians, Israel keeps bombing Palestinians down to the ground, and it has effects that are felt right here, even in Ann Arbor. You cannot find a Palestinian who isn't terrified to publicly bring up the subject of Palestinian rights. It's because of you.

You've heard me before, and you may recall from our previous communications, speaking on behalf of Bike Washtenaw, that we'd like to see two things on the bridge. Widening the west sidewalk to about 15 feet to make room for bi-directional bike lanes and a pedestrian lane, which would also serve as part of a campus-to-campus bikeway, and building the planned trail loop under the bridge, which would also be a part of that bikeway. We think it should be straightforward to resolve MDOT's concerns about that.  Now the proposal before you, as I understand it, would call for restoring some or all of the sidewalk space that was taken away in the earlier plan. I have some questions about that, and I'm not sure what the answers are. Is most of the cost of that due to an added beam being needed underneath and abutment support for that? And if so, how many feet of added sidewalk space could we get for an added beam?  If I understand the engineering drawings correctly, both about our current bridge and the planned future bridge, the current beams are about just under six feet apart, five feet, 11 inches, and a little bit more. If that's the case, then we could get approximately six feet of additional sidewalk space by adding a beam. So it'd be good, if this is true, it'd be good to verify that, both council and staff, to find out if that's true, and that may open an opportunity to widen that west sidewalk.  As you know, the city and university have carbon neutrality plans. The university's plan calls for a bikeway between North Campus and Central Campus. This facility could serve as a part of that bikeway.  Ann Arbor's A20 plan calls for a reduction of vehicle miles traveled by 2030 of 50% in Ann Arbor and 25% of trips by walking and biking in Ann Arbor by 2030. Now whether or not you think these goals are achievable, at least it would be good to work towards these goals.  This bridge gives us an opportunity to make progress towards these goals and an opportunity in one of the parts of town with some of the heaviest bicycle and pedestrian traffic. This bridge is a major long-term investment. It's important, we think, to do it right and not to make a $10 million mistake. Thanks.",Transportation and Mobility

I live at 621 5th Street, and I am an environmental commissioner, but I'm speaking for myself tonight. I want to encourage all households and businesses to contact the Michigan Public Service Commission, because as you're considering in the resolution DC-5 tonight, electricity is an essential service, and DTE does not deserve the requested rate increase that it has made.  In our house, we experienced two back-to-back power outages in the last two weeks, triggered by ice and wet snow, but actually caused by poorly maintained DTE infrastructure. DTE admits that it deferred maintenance in its 2022 year-end earnings conference call. You can find it by Googling its earnings conference call and see pages 10 and 11, on which deferred maintenance is highlighted as a feature of earnings for 2022 and is planned for 2023.  We're lucky here. We were cold, but safe and concerned. We only had 80 hours without electricity over the two events. I witnessed firsthand a wire that dropped to the ground behind our house on Friday, March 3, that sparked throughout the night until noon on Saturday. Firefighters assessed the situation early on, determined that it was not critical, and called DTE. It wasn't to be a repair. A DTE safety staffer sat in a car idling  at the head of a dead-end street watching it to the wire to be sure that people did not approach the unsafe wire. At noon on Saturday the power was cut and the repair of power was completed 24 hours later on Sunday. We heard about people's loss of work expenses for spoiled food and obtaining food that did not need to be cooked during the outage as well as costs for hotel rooms when available many of which were priced excessively. Please add the cost of Ann Arbor firefighter time that was not available for other fire emergencies in the city  due to the need to check on the many downed hot wires, the cost of warming centers, and other emergency services in the city. Those costs add up and they should be charged directly to DTE. We appreciate the service of all the technicians and electricians who helped return our power. We're not pleased with how DTE management appears to depend on ignoring maintenance to gain the financial return for its investors and simultaneously ask for higher rates.  In Bridge Magazine, it's reported on February 10th that DTE asked the MPSC for permission to increase its yearly revenues by $62 million, representing a 14% residential rate increase. At the same time, DTE reported a $1.1 billion gain to its investors. What the heck? Search for MPSC on the eDocket. Once on that page, search for case number U21297.  click on submit comment and tell the MPSC to deny the rate increase requested by DTE and set a procedure to make DTE accountable to its customers ahead of its investors. I agree with the resolution that you're considering tonight and agree with the prior speakers that you remove the resolve clause relating to DTE as a regular participant in the Energy Commission. DTE should not influence our Energy Commission recommendations  They're extremely good at crafting influential messages that distort actual services received.",Utilities

It is a strong attempt at a path towards regulating a corporation that continues to act in its own best interest, not those of the residents of Ann Arbor. However, requiring DTE to attend commission meetings to report on its progress may in the end be the same as giving DTE a seat at the proverbial table and access it may use to exert its influence on the commission. What may be nearly as bad for the city.  and the commission is the perception that DTE has been given a seat at the table. Because everyone knows that DTE's ultimate goal is not to provide power or amazing service to the people of Ann Arbor. DTE's ultimate goal, because it's a corporation, is to make as much money for its CEO and shareholders as it possibly can. We have to remember that, from DTE's point of view, Ann Arbor is merely a solidly storm-proofed power line  reinforced to withstand the harshest storms so that it may reliably transmit cash from city residents to DTE's CEO and shareholders. They rely on access to political power to keep that infrastructure in place. If the goal of this resolution is to create more accountability and the perception of more accountability, giving DTE access to political power or the perception of access to political power  will only create the appearance or the reality that ET has been put in an even better position to exert its influence over local energy policy.

I live at State Street Village Apartments. And part of the reason why I'm here today is because I've lived in a lot of areas, but this is the first time where I'm paying as much in rent as I have been. I'm paying as much in utilities as I have ever. And the first time I've ever been without power for more than six days. And that's why today I want to talk about a critical issue that affects us all, power outages. Power outages are a major inconvenience, and they can have devastating consequences for businesses, hospitals, and homes.  They disrupt our lives, compromise our safety, and harm our economy. But what causes these power outages? One of the main reasons is the failure of privately owned electric utilities to invest in infrastructure and modernize their power grids. Private utilities often prioritize their profits over the needs of their customers, which can lead to the neglect of the system, resulting in blackouts and brownouts.  It's time to recognize that electricity is a basic human need and should be treated as a public good, not a commodity for private profit. We need a public ownership model for our electric utilities, one that puts the needs of the peoples first.  Public ownership of electric utilities means that the community, through its elected representatives, owns and controls the electrical grid. This model ensures that the utility is run in the interest of the public and not for private gain. It also means that the public can hold those in charge accountable for their actions, something that has been severely lacking.  In addition, public ownership of electrical utilities would lead to greater investment in infrastructure, making the power grid more reliable and less vulnerable to outages. It would also create jobs and economic opportunities in our communities, as local workers would be employed to maintain and upgrade the system.  Some argue that public ownership of utilities would be inefficient, but the evidence suggests otherwise. Municipal utilities, which are owned by local governments, consistently outperform private utilities in terms of reliability, affordability, and customer satisfaction.  In conclusion, power outages are a serious problem, and we need to take action to address them. Public ownership over electrical utilities is the solution. It will ensure that the needs of the people are put first, and that our power grid is reliable, modern, and sustainable. Let's work together to make this a reality. Thank you.",Utilities

I'm here because energy is really important to me, and I'm really interested in the resolution that's being proposed. I'm really happy to see the enthusiasm, and I feel like as a city, we're moving in the right direction.  But I have a concern about, well, I'd like to say first, I really appreciate being able to talk with Dharma Ackman and Jen Iron, my reps, after the storm about many of the issues that we see in the resolution. But I do have a concern about DTE being invited to the table, that clause being invited to the Energy Commission. And I would hope that somebody could explain to me why that is and what the intent of that is.  I personally don't see that they deserve to have a seat at the table. What I would like to point out is also, and I'll get around to this, but in terms of the resolution, I think it's great to try to work with the state, but we also have an opportunity as a city to create our own municipal utility and bypass dealing with a state. And I'd like to point out the state has not been effective in regulating DTE. If you look at the MPSC,  They said themselves in an October 25th press release, 2022, over the past decades, the MPSC has issued a series of directives in response to widespread outages after storms. While there are important efforts underway, the reality is that we still haven't seen improvements in reliability and safety that Michigan customers deserve.  That's our own commission saying that. When we talk about the legislature, a report from the Energy and Policy Institute reports that 138 out of 148 state senators accept money from DTE. Governor Whitmer accepts more money than any other state elected official. We can bypass the state and work at a city level. And we have the opportunity to do that. We have the legal right to do that.  So I think that's something I'd really like to see us do. The feasibility study will show us what options we have.

I live on Ember Way in Ann Arbor, as I have lived here for the past 40 years. As we've all seen way too clearly the last two weeks, DTE has failed us. Thank you for taking a first step towards demanding accountability for these unacceptable electric outages.  This was completely predictable and largely preventable. DTE can be relied upon to be unreliable, and this is nothing new. Over 40 years ago, then Detroit Edison made a business decision to focus on shareholder value instead of reliability and customer service, and it shows.  One summer in the late 1980s, Detroit lost power. My healthy 93-year-old grandma sergeant became hyperthermic in the heat and humidity of August without air conditioning. She was taken to Sinai Hospital, where she lapsed into a coma and never regained consciousness.  In 2006, we experienced one of our frequent power outages in my neighborhood. My son's buddy's little sister had developed a progressive muscular dystrophy, which left her dependent on breathing equipment at night. I asked the DTE supervisor cruising through our neighborhood, can you get this family some help? Their little girl can't breathe at night without power. The reply? If she can't breathe, she should go to a hospital. That family moved away.  Last week, I found another DTE supervisor driving through a nearby neighborhood and asked, what was causing our four plus day power outage? He said, it is the trees. Tell your neighbors to trim their trees. My neighborhood has underground utilities. Our trees are not guilty.  The callous disregard for the health and safety of the customers cannot be accepted one more day. It is literally a matter of life and death, particularly in winter and summer when babies under six and the elderly cannot regulate their body temperature at a safe level, but any time of year for people who rely on electricity for medical equipment and safe storage of life-sustaining medicine.  I urge you, the council, to join with Washtenaw County and the city of Pontiac to proclaim that this pattern ends here. In 2013, the city of Lansing experienced a catastrophic ice storm with prolonged outages. The citizens called on their municipal utility that is accountable to them, the citizens, to ensure that this would never happen again. Here is the report.  outlining all the changes they made. And no, it is not just the trees. They have not had a major power outage since. These last two storms resulted in fewer than 100 of 100,000 customers out of power briefly. Accountability matters. Either we demand better or we pull the plug on DTE and take the power into our own hands. Thank you.",Utilities

I work with Ann Arbor for Public Power, which is seeking to replace CTE with Ann Arbor's own public electric utility. I'd like to strongly commend Council Members Scottie Edwin, Song, and Harrison  for the resolution they put forward, quote, requesting the city administration to engage with the Michigan legislature and Michigan Public Service Commission to advance energy equity and resilience, unquote. It spells out the many ways in which we need to hold VTE accountable for its lack of reliability during the recent ice storm and during the snowstorm that followed. Hundreds of residents in Ann Arbor and in Southeast Michigan  lost power during both storms, some for as many as eight days, a few even longer. We should all be outraged at DTE's lack of preparation for these ever more extreme weather conditions. I propose one small amendment to the resolution, and that is to remove the clause stating that DTE should, quote, attend regularly scheduled Energy Commission meetings to provide updates on what DTE is doing  to improve the resilience of its infrastructure with a focus on energy justice and decarbonization."" The Energy Commission has the power to call on DTE to speak at its meetings and to get updates at any time. To allow DTE to be always present at Energy Commission meetings gives DTE the opportunity to push forward its PR campaign to greenwash what it's doing and not doing.  So I suggest amending the resolution to remove this one clause. But again, I thank council members Ghazi, Edwin, Sung, and Harrison for putting this resolution forward.

I'm among the unlucky few who had power out for about eight days or for over eight days. I had my power restored on the ninth day of outage, and just five hours later, my power failed once again due to the snowstorm. I'm calling in because I would like to commend Council Member  Ghazi Edwin, Song, and Harrison as well for their resolution calling on greater accountability for DTE within the Michigan Public Service Commission, legislature, and at the city level. I think that it's incredibly important that we all use this tragedy, this mass power outage, to really demand change for something that has been going on for far too long.  DTE has made the strategic decision to invest in our politics rather than their infrastructure. They're the 430th utility. They're one of the most expensive utilities. And as we all just saw, they're one of the most unreliable, with up to nine-day outages followed by even longer outages that have not been fully resolved. Meanwhile, public power utilities like Lansing, Chelsea, Wyandotte all had very short-lived outages or none at all.  The difference is clear between public power and private utilities. And I think that other people across the state are looking to Ann Arbor and seeing that we have taken the steps forward to start to break free and are trying to follow in our example. It's incredibly important that we continue to move along this process to give hope to others in the state that we no longer will have to live under the rule and callous regime of DTE. So I would like to thank  the commission, the council members, apologies for introducing this resolution. However, I would, as other speakers have stated, recommend that it be amended to remove the clause, adding a permanent speaking position to the energy commission meetings for DTE. DTE has already proven that they are willing to lie about their investments in their infrastructure, bragging just a day after the outage, their shareholders about how they  saved $100 million by deferring tree trimming and plan to continue deferring maintenance to keep their budget lean, all the same time while bragging about reliability upgrades to the press. We simply can't allow them to keep spreading this type of misinformation within our city government. We need to remove their lobbying capabilities and we need to break free from them so that we can start to build a resilient and sustainable energy grid that will carry us through the climate crisis.

Derek Miller, resident of Ann Arbor on Pauline Boulevard, and also speaking on behalf of Community Action Network. There has been a widespread disruption to services for under-resourced families with pockets of outages still persisting. In fact, just two days ago, a community resident had reached out on behalf of their 89-year-old neighbor, still without power. By reaching out to our contacts at DT, we were fortunately able to get a team out there to prioritize the repair. Although this response was to the benefit of this elderly resident,  it is symptomatic of a broken system requiring clout for resolution. Loss of food security resources as well as the ability to distribute was seriously compromised and we are the largest distributor in partnership with food gathers in Washtenaw County. Scrambling to meet emerging needs in light of uncertainty of when power would return, this led to emergency actions from dozens of nonprofits as well as municipal staff to enact remediation strategies on an already stretched system.  For example, can establish an emergency food distribution distributing over 7,000 pounds of food and over $5,000 in gift cards. The city in partnership with can and other partners also set up several warming centers, including overnight warming centers, one of which was at the north side for you center, which is one of the universe few resiliency hubs. With expectations that severe weather will only become more volatile. We are far from experiencing challenges to our grid other and other life saving resources.  In addition to tackling climate change, we also need to ensure top levels of accountability from our utility providers, as well as explore options in which to build community resilience.

Mayor, council members, as you just heard, my name is Jeff Wilkerson.  the petitioner and developer for the North Maple Road Apartments project that is on tonight's new business agenda item. I'm also the founder of A2 Collaborative, a local design development firm that, along with local engineering and architectural services, played a role in the early and ongoing project design. I know that this is the first reading for this PUD rezoning,  but I wanted to take the opportunity to introduce and summarize the project and talk about some of our various features. Our team worked diligently to blend elements of sustainability, affordability, community connectivity, and also a reduced reliance on auto-related infrastructure. In fact, our design has an approximately 82% parking to unit ratio.  Not only do these design features, these are important to A2 Collaborative as a firm, but we also believe that they are valued by the community and the city of Ann Harbor. Through our efforts, I believe that we have put together a project that will have a meaningful impact on addressing the lack of housing in the city, as well as producing and allowing for units that will remain  forever affordable at a 60% AMI level. Our project is located on a major trunk line that has access to other parts of the city and the project includes a clubhouse that is dedicated to bike storage and maintenance as well as e-bike charging. The building itself will use far less energy  than a traditionally designed code built apartment complex. And we believe that this plays a role in reducing our carbon footprint and angling towards a less intensive carbon intensive future.  Our building will be all electrified. We will offset a percentage of our energy usage through photovoltaics. And we will have a built-in level of resiliency through a geothermal design that has been incorporated into the courtyard and the parking lot. And so thank you all for your time as I introduce this project. And me and my team will be available to answer any and all questions. Thank you.",Housing

My name is Ralph Marcus and I represent Earhart Village Association, the 174 unit owners. There are members of the community either requesting to speak tonight or watching or on the call.  We asked to have input in the engineering department's plans for the sidewalk that's contemplated with the Earhart 2023 reconstruction prior to those plans being consulted and submitted, and we were not allowed to have that opportunity. We have asked to be formally advised of a processing track for the plans, for the preliminary plans, and quite frankly, no one from the city has responded, making  this process a little unfriendly, necessitating the use of the association's lawyer at a cost to the association to gain the attention of folks in the city. And we'd rather not proceed in that fashion, but it unfortunately has come to that. We've asked someone to provide a written response to the path of the meetings and schedule for processing and approving the project. And we've asked for those, we've submitted those questions to you all in writing.  Again, we have not had any response. We've made presentations at the Transportation Commission and the Planning Commission, and some of the responses that took place during those meetings were just inaccurate or untrue statements by the folks on those commissions. And I don't blame them, but they just don't have the necessary facts in front of them. We have presented objective rationales to why the planned sidewalk on the eastern side of Earhart Road is just another unconnected sidewalk to nowhere, probably in perpetuity.  The sidewalk can't be placed, as we understand it, in front of Botsford Cemetery. You cannot move the complicated utility equipment on the north end of our property. There's a conservation easement that has a partial sidewalk, which would have to be reconstructed. And that is where the planning commission said, well, the sidewalk's already there. Well, part of it is, but part of it's not. And there's a restriction in that recorded conservation easement, which precludes construction on that property.  Also, there's not any sidewalk apparently being contemplated between the two pine braze streets. So we're kind of at a loss as to why the sidewalk has become so important to the engineering department. If it was to be constructed, the sidewalk would damage critical root tree root and actually remove about seven trees and have to have root protection for a number 30 or 40. And we think that there's probably about 30 trees in total that would have to be removed.  The preliminary road improvement plan that was presented by engineering shows, and I'd like everyone to take note of this, on pages 21, 27, and 40, that the engineering department has this sidewalk, which is supposed to be in the right-of-way, extending into the private property of Earhart Village. I can assure you that Earhart Village has absolutely no intention of providing any authority for the sidewalk to be on its private property, and we do not want the sidewalk constructed.  As we stated earlier, there are these trees that would be damaged.",Transportation and Mobility

And I am opposed to the sidewalk. I don't think the city has listened to us. And I don't think our council members have represented us. Well, you keep referring back to 300 reviews that you had from local residents regarding this project from 2019, I believe it is.  at which point the sidewalk was not even a factor, and you say nobody opposed the sidewalk. Well, nobody opposed it because it wasn't even a factor in that project. So that's a ridiculous argument on behalf of the city. There's plenty of area in the existing roadway to put in two lanes of road, two bike lanes, and if you must have a sidewalk, put it in the existing area.  You said you can't move the curb. Well, I think you can. And in the way that our governor says things, move the damn curb. If you must have a sidewalk, don't impose it on the residents of Earhart village. Speed is also a factor here. And that was requested by the 300 reports that you got back from 2019. And I don't believe that the roundabouts will reduce the speed. So I am requesting that the speed limit be reduced  to 30 miles per hour, like it is on Glacier Way, as opposed to the 35 miles an hour that it is now. And I also hope that in this whole project, you address Green Hill School and our ability to exit and enter our driveway without obstruction during drop-off and pickup time. At this point, we are hostages in our own parking lots because of double parking  and people picking up and dropping off people at Green Hill School that has never been addressed.

I'm here to talk about a golf issue that we're having. My issue pales in comparison to no energy, but it's important to me and it's important to 50 other senior golfers that play at Leslie Park. In 2009, you adopted a resolution that set rates and restrictions for season passes and green fees.  Since that time, the green fees have been amended five times, each time by council approval. Season passes have never been brought forward for amendment. They remain as you adopted them in 2009. This year, amendments were made by staff that changed the original intention of the adopted resolution. For example,  Senior season passes specifically allowed we can play for senior golf the commentary section specifically says Now available for use on weekends This year Park staff changed that policy so that seniors can no longer play on the weekends We are not allowed to play at Leslie Park or  on Saturday and Sunday, unless we pay the daily fee, or by a full season pass, which costs $400 more, or a 67% increase. Seniors are the only ones impacted with these cost increases. That is not right. The change, I believe, is not in line with the original intention that council adopted in this resolution.  The second change that was made was to limit the use of a full pass. A full pass allowed users to play seven days a week anytime. Now Parks is saying you cannot play on weekends until after 12. You would think that's no big deal. But the resolution specifically states it's a full pass. It does not allow for restrictions. For me, the cost I estimate to play on the weekends, because I play in the mornings, will be $1,500.  I will gladly pay that, but I'm going to pay that somewhere else if I have to, because I feel that passionate about the change that has been made that it is not right. And again, the change to the full pass does not meet the original intention of the resolution that you adopted. Another change is the original resolution included monthly, senior, full, and weekday passes. Those have not been offered in the four years that I've been in Ann Arbor. I don't know where they went.  The resolution you adopted allows it, but they've disappeared. I think they need to be reinstated and offered to the golfers as allowed by the resolution. I believe that the resolution binds the park staff to offer what was presented and approved. Staff should not be allowed to change the original intent of any resolution that you adopt.  The changes currently made by parks were never presented to the public, and we hope that you do something about trying to get these back in order. So, thank you.",Parks and Recreation

I reside at 782 Greenhills Drive and represent Earhart Village Homes Association as its president.  I want the council to be advised that Earhart Village in no manner, shape or form proposes or provides that the city of Ann Arbor with any permission to trespass onto our private property for the construction of a contemplated and unwanted sidewalk. A properly circulated and documented petition of over 100 residents of Earhart Village has been formally submitted along with the board resolution  and narrating cover letter objecting to the subject sidewalk. We asked the clerk to accept the petition and the accompanying documents. Bearheart Road needs to be repaved. It just doesn't need to have a sidewalk to nowhere built, which would be a dramatic waste of city resources and will ultimately lead to significant damage to the property of Bearheart Village. Should our reasonable requests not be accommodated, as they have not been so far,  We certainly are positioned with legal counsel to protect the interests of our residents. Notwithstanding, we would rather collaborate with the city for an amicable solution and invite all parties to a meeting to reconsider the existing plan. I'm most concerned about the fact that we have attended all the community meetings regarding this project, beginning in April, 2019 through December, 2022, to express our opposition to the construction of this sidewalk.  We have written to the mayor, to the city attorney, the city administrator, the public service manager, planning manager, council person, and others, and no one, not one person has responded to us. We have commented during the most recent planning and transportation committee meetings, and we have been left dismayed by the inaccurate responses of some of the commissioners and engineering personnel. We pay our taxes. Where is our representation?  We believe the sidewalk is unnecessary because the sidewalk already exists on the other side of the street. And there is no requirement in Ann Arbor for sidewalks on both sides of the street. You've already heard about the many gaps that would exist between the Pine Gray streets in front of Botsford Cemetery and on our conservation easement. And we do not believe that the 1972 sanitary sewer easement previously granted  gives the city the authority to construct on our private property. Our ISA certified arborist noted in his recent inspection that not only will an unsightly retaining wall be required due to the grade, but removing large tree roots can make our remaining trees unstable and a hazard to the homes behind them. The construction activity will stress the remaining trees, making them susceptible to insects and diseases, causing death and decline. And on top of that,  The tree canopy in our neighborhood has already been severely impacted by the development of the Concord Pines subdivision where over 1,000 trees were recently destroyed. We believe the city's plan will diminish our livable community by increasing air and noise pollution.",Urban Development

I'm calling from Ward 5 to speak about the rezoning of 415 West Washington, which has been  recommended by the planning department. 415 West Washington is a difficult site to develop, especially for residential use. That is because most of the site is in the floodplain. One of the highest authorities on building in the floodplain is the National Flood Insurance Program. And they are quoted in our own city website as recommending that, quote, residential uses in the floodplain be discouraged, end quote.  That, to me, is a very clear recommendation. Don't build residential in the floodplain. Locally, we have Jerry Hancock, our stormwater and floodplain programs coordinator. In his memo to the planning department dated February 6th of this year, he says, quote, for the past 19 years, the policy direction the city has taken for floodplain mitigation  through the various hazard mitigation plans has been to look for opportunities to purchase property, demolish structures, and lower the intensity of use in the floodplain. The concept plan to sell 415 Washington, this city-owned parcel, works at cross purposes to the city's floodplain mitigation efforts,"" end quote. But Mr. Hancock's memo does not  mentioned the toxins in the 415 West Washington site. Lucky for us, Rita La Caruso, Professor Emerita U of M, addresses the toxins in her March 17 letter to our mayor and city council. Her letter reminds us of two things. First, that both the benzene and the TCE found at the 415 Washington site are known carcinogens. Second, her letter reminds us that, quote,  Because of flooding risk, the possibility that flood water will carry pollutants beyond the site requires careful, knowledgeable analysis,"" end quote. The kind of analysis that personally I would trust only experts to do.

We oppose the Earhart Road 2023 project. Although we were promised meetings with our city council members and the project engineers, they have not occurred. We want to know why you would accept a design that diminishes the level of service  As reported in a memo dated February 15th, 2019 from Grace Crow and Cynthia Redinger to Nick Hutchinson. Where's the data to justify spending taxpayer money on projects that reduce the level of service? Also the city's uniform development code stipulates that proposals contributing to a level of service of D, E, or F can be denied by city council. Why should the same stipulation not only apply to existing roads when implementing road diets?  We believe there is room to consider more than one design scenario, as was done for the Gettys Road Improvement Project. The city collaborated with private property owners and made adjustments which resulted in fewer trees destroyed, a shared use path, and bike lanes. Since Earhart Road currently has four lanes and the proposal reduces the road to two lanes, there is sufficient room for other design scenarios. As proposed, the city will paint Chevron lines over excess road surface.  Let's move the driving lane closer to the median and use the excess road for a bike lane and a walking path or a larger shared path. Constructing a sidewalk outside of the existing road will increase the overall width of the corridor. Keeping intact the existing property line and mature trees creates a narrow road visual, a known factor in reducing auto speeds. Additionally, the Route 3 bus stop at the corner of Earhart and Gettys is located just west of Earhart Road.  So most using the stop would have used the existing western sidewalk. All of the schools, churches, and other tributary streets to King Elementary Schools are on or connect to the western sidewalk. All residents living on the eastern side must cross Terre Heart Road at some point to reach those destinations. They will use the closest crosswalk to get on the west side of the street. The goal should be reducing overall road speed and on creating adequate and properly designed crosswalk  rather than creating a sidewalk to nowhere with gaps that will remain into perpetuity, like in front of Oxford Cemetery and Pineberry Street.

I am Dr. Larry Junk, a citizen of Ann Arbor, here to speak in favor of Resolution 230382. I favor asking our city to explore moving away from DTE as a supplier of fossil gas and toward alternative suppliers that will partner with Ann Arbor as the city steadily moves towards phasing out fossil fuels and moves towards carbon neutrality by 2030.  I'm a professor at University of Michigan Medical School, speaking on my own accord, but also as a volunteer for Michigan Clinicians for Climate Action.  My scientific training provides a foundation for understanding the effects of climate change on our world, and my medical training provides a foundation for understanding the health risks. To quote leading climate scientist Catherine Hayhoe, the difference between a higher versus lower emissions future is nothing less than the survival of our civilization.  I am most concerned about the following problems caused by climate change. Increasing direct heat deaths, extreme weather events causing flooding in Detroit and elsewhere, the unusual occurrence of three major hurricanes in the U.S. in the past year, widespread drought such as that affecting the western U.S., unprecedented loss of species, and threats to our agriculture and food supply.  As a physician, I'm concerned about the ongoing and severe health consequences of air pollution at present, also of mosquito-borne illnesses such as West Nile virus at present, and the threat of malaria returning to the U.S. in the future. In recent years, we have learned that the burning of fossil gas is a worse problem than previously known.  One reason is that it's drilling, fracking, transportation, and use in our homes releases substantial amounts of unburned methane, the main component of gas, which is even stronger than CO2 and causing climate change. Also, recent research shows a number of direct adverse health effects from gas leaked in our homes. DTE is far behind other energy companies in Michigan and elsewhere in moving towards sustainable sources of energy.  DTE appears to be paying little attention to the future of our climate or the health of our citizens. If this resolution passes, I urge city officials to explore the following. Is it true that DTE uses large amounts of rate payer dollars for campaign donations and for lobbying against sustainable energy?  Is it true that DTE uses my money to support their greenwashing commercials on TV, which ignore their foot dragging with sustainable energy?  And finally, is it true that four months ago DTE requested that the Michigan Public Service Commission approve large rate increases to protect high pay for its executives and high return to its shareholders? High pay and high returns to shareholders seem inappropriate for a company like DTE that fights to preserve generation of dirty energy using 20th century technology.

I'm here to still demand that this city council passes a resolution and speaks up against the slaughter of Palestinian people. I have been coming here for 20 years and I will continue to come until I see the state of Israel go out of business.  And members who are sitting here are very well aware of the genocide that's happening to Palestinian people. I know that because I spent a few minutes talking to here, Ms. America, Ms. Erica, Erica.  Briggs, and she told me that she's all aware. Everything I said to her, I said, children are being killed. And she said, I know that. I said, every time you just carelessly go to work without paying any attention to the lives of people you impact, children are dying. Children that I care about, children that I know and I want to protect. And to all of that, she responded, I know.  Therefore, if she knows, I'm sure the rest of you know, and if you didn't know, you must be receiving all my emails and all my links so you know there is a genocide happening in Palestine with the money that this country, United States of America, provides for a racist Nazi state like Israel. You must very well be aware of all of this.  There is a human rights commission in this town, and I was very excited when I first arrived here to know that such thing exists. What I didn't realize is that it could easily be cleaned up by Zionists in this town and be promoted to something basically less than a jello popsicle. And now we have people right here, Ms.  who is on the Human Rights Commission, yet she knows nothing about the history of the Human Rights Commission, and she knows nothing about Palestinian struggle, and she could care less about it. And this woman has been handpicked to sit there because of these two qualities. She has no knowledge, and she couldn't care less about Palestinian people.  The one topic in the world today is the Palestinian human rights. People who care about human rights in the world, the first issue is human rights of the Palestinian. Yet this lady here doesn't give a rat's ass about it, and she does not hide it. So I am here to say,  The reason why you guys have no energy and you left, and I can see that our mayor has gotten much older and much weaker, and his voice is unconvincing, even when he's giving awards away. He is falling asleep. It's because your conscious is heavy with burden. And it should be, because you are acting like inhumane beast. It is easy to say we are against giving fucking,  bullets and bombs to murderers. It's easy to say that, yet you don't say it. It weighs heavy on you.

No city council ever fought harder or longer to keep killing Palestinians.  Isn't it strange that the city council member that took all that campaign money from old friends of the Israel Defense Forces just had to run out of the room? For 20 years, you have forcefully halted every resolution that objected to US military aid pouring into Israel. 20 years.  Your main weapon is to keep the word anti-Semitism on speed dial and wield it as a weapon to protect the apartheid state of Israel. You are exactly like a Klansman shedding crocodile tears over anti-white racism while lynching your way across black America.  There is nothing lower than a corrupted governmental body like you, corrupted by your 20 years of treating, 20 years of treating the Palestinian people like insects to be banished from your site. That's how you treat them.  In this foul atmosphere of genocidal racism, you sent the police to clear out your chambers here when they were packed with Palestinian protesters and your friends.  You ignored thousands who petitioned you, thousands who marched outside this building for an end to aid to Israel. You are even unmoved by Israel's long, intimate military alliance with apartheid South Africa. With apartheid South Africa, for God's sake, even that doesn't move you.  No U.S. City Council, none, can match your record, your bloody record, of racism against a Palestinian people. Ha, the mayor can't even make eye contact. Asshole. 20 inhuman years of refusing to even vote on a simple resolution like this. We are against military aid to Israel. Simple.  You fiercely punished your own Ann Arbor Human Rights Commission when it dared to propose such a resolution to you. Meanwhile, loaded with your tax money and guarded by your mayor's gavel, Israel continues shooting and bombing its way across the Middle East. Across the Middle East.",Israel-Palestine

I hope you had a chance to look at the material I sent yesterday that illustrates a little bit what I'll be talking about. As you know, you directed staff to restore the two and a half feet that were taken away from the bridge and the design to the west sidewalk on the bridge to make it ten and a half feet like it is. Now,  It may turn out that doing that requires adding an additional beam underneath the bridge. If that's the case, then it potentially could be six feet added there rather than two and a half feet, because the existing beams on the bridge that are there both now and in the current plan are just about six feet across, five feet, 11 inches, and a little bit more.  So it might be possible at minimal cost to widen that sidewalk. The main cost isn't the decking on the top. The main cost is the support structure underneath. So if we can get, using basically the same support structure, get some added width on that sidewalk, that would be beneficial.  And then instead of having a 10 and a half foot sidewalk there, we could have a 14 foot sidewalk with room for bi-directional bike lanes and a pedestrian lane. And in turn, that would connect to the planned trail loop under the bridge, which we hope to have built before too long and make it better for everybody and safer and more comfortable for bikers and walkers. Council Member Rodina responded to me, and I appreciate the comment, that the  issue before you says at least 10 1鈦? feet on that bridge. And that's good that it says that, but it doesn't say to try to go more. What I would ask is that the council direct staff to investigate the possibility of making that addition wider than 2 1鈦? feet, make it up to maybe 6 feet, so that we end up with a very safe and usable wider sidewalk there. So if we can make that  direction in some way to staff that would be beneficial, I think. Thank you.",Transportation and Mobility

I am personally quite excited to see this project advance. I think the public benefits provided by it are really important to the city. And so I'm hoping you will not only approve this rezoning request, but take whatever steps are prudent to ensure that the project actually succeeds, it actually gets built, and actually provides all the promised benefits.  So talking about the benefits, as proposed, this PUD would involve remediating the environmental contamination on the site, would reactivate a long blighted site and put it to productive uses, adding badly needed market rates and affordable housing on site, and then the proceeds would help fund other affordable housing projects elsewhere in the city. This last bit is particularly important because we are seeing development costs continue to rise for affordable housing projects.  As I recall, there was a recent memo about the Catherine and fourth project discussing that increased costs are already becoming a problem. So our affordable housing millage is not enough. We need to take every opportunity we can get to supplement it. And this project would do that. However, it's clear. Also, this is going to be a difficult project to develop.  It requires environmental remediation. There are several additional restrictions in these proposed PUD regulations, including preventing construction in the floodway, requiring that the chimney be preserved, requiring that a segment of the treeline trail be constructed. By the way, on the last point, the proposed ordinance specifically requires collaboration with the Treeline Conservancy, which is a private nonprofit  By name in the ordinance, and I'm not I'm not sure if it's actually appropriate to or proper to name a private entity in a zoning ordinance like that. Maybe maybe I'll could look into that anyway.  The point here, I saw in Council Member Briggs' newsletter that she's planning to propose an amendment that would add even more development restrictions to this site around green building requirements. And I can certainly appreciate the intent behind this, but I would ask, has anyone evaluated whether such an amendment would impact the feasibility of this project? We need to make sure that we are not making the perfect the enemy of the good here. We do need this project to succeed. Thank you.",Housing

Yes, this is Vince Caruso, 556 Bundell Circle.  a coordinating member and founding member of the Allens Creek Watershed Group, board and founding member of CARD, Coalition for Action and Remediation, and a former elected executive committee member of the Sierra Club Durham Valley Group. I'm calling tonight to state that putting residential housing at 415 West Washington would be a major mistake and very dangerous. New discussions at City Hall regarding development at 415  for residential ill-advised. The Palms Creek Group does not support this proposal. We communicated this to the City Council and Planning Commission several times. Earth Street Foundation, which is an open source flood modeling group, has been closely working with the Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, in recent years to update and greatly update the lowfall current floodplain maps of up to 33%  but they really are, and FEMA agrees. FEMA is now working on FEMA 2.0 to update their maps that they say are not accurate. Our current city leaders pretend to plan for global warming, but propose building residential, no less, in dangerous floodplain locations. For some reason, city officials failed to involve Harry Hancock in the evaluation of 415 plan. Planning officials stated, oh, our bad.  Jerry made comment anyway. Jerry Hancock, the city's stormwater and floodplain programs coordinator, raised concerns about the development proposal saying putting a large residential structure in the flood zone is inconsistent with the city's flood mitigation policy. Since 2004, the city's policy has been to look for opportunities to purchase floodplain properties and demolish structures. Chemicals on this site are set to be planted, to be cleaned, or treated, but may float  in flood water if a flood occurs, in addition to the chemicals coming from all the flooded cars on the site. These chemicals will migrate into the neighborhoods and contaminate homes in the Old West Side. R-15 West Washington site was flooded in 1968 in a 100-year flood. Reliable sources, it was more like a 50-year rain. When a meeting of city officials, the Watershed Council, and county officials were meeting in the building,  to discuss flood hazards. 30 seconds. And it seemed to be a drain commissioner with an attendant. His car was flooded in total, and they were trapped in this building. They had no idea they were in a dangerous situation with a flood soon to happen, which tells you how dangerous this site is. Flood experts were trapped in this building. The 68 floodwaters are very close to the train trestle at 415 at 10 feet, 6 inches. The site is, in all likelihood, has much larger floodplain  due to climate change from the low falling and their floodplain maps time much more dangerous than the maps suggest voters.",Environment and Sustainability

As a 30-year real estate professional, including experience as a developer, with your zonings in multiple communities, I want to speak about the latest in a pattern of problematic zoning actions noticed by experts in planning and zoning over the past several years.  The application for 415 West Washington clearly does not meet the intent of multiple laws and policies. Our policies do not intend for development such as this, at this location, which is in a historic district and almost entirely in a floodplain. The proposal is for a PUD based on D2 zoning baseline characteristics. D2 permits a maximum height of 60 feet tall, with 70 feet achievable with a premium.  However, the UDC states, quote, premium options may be applied only to lots that are located entirely out of a historic district and that contain no part of a floodplain. The D2 premium is clearly not to be used at this location. The proposal instead uses a planned development to achieve this very same thing, 70 feet instead of 60 feet, linked to a similar affordable housing premium.  Yet the UDC says that a PUD quote, shall not be allowed where it's sought primarily to avoid the imposition of standards and requirements of other zoning classifications or other city regulations. There's a more recently added premium that allows 30% additional height in exchange for affordable housing or sustainability. The applicant is basing its justification on this newer premium.  that replaced planned projects after the Lower Town lawsuit demonstrated that planned project section of the UDC was not in compliance with the Michigan Zoning Enabling Act. This newer premium makes no mention of historic districts nor floodplains. Since the intent is very clear in the first premium ordinance language, these two sections are thus in conflict.  The UDC speaks to that. Quote, where conditions, standards, or requirements imposed by any provisions of this chapter are either more restrictive or less restrictive than comparable standards imposed by any other law, ordinance, or regulation, the provisions that are more restrictive or that impose higher standards or requirements shall govern. So we are left with the intent of the UDC to not exceed the standard D2 height maximum of 60 feet in a historic district or in a floodplain which both  apply to this location. Additionally, the historic district guidelines have not been followed. They state that new buildings are to be designed to be compatible with surrounding buildings that contribute to the overall character of the historic district in terms of height, form, size, scale, massing proportions, and roof shape. This has not been designed to be compatible with the contributing structures in the historic district.  Please reject this application and send it back to follow our laws and policies.

I am one of the co-leaders of Citizens for Mental Health and Public Safety. I urge you to allocate the city's revenue from the county mental health and public safety millage to the unarmed response program.  The appropriation for millage funds of about $2.8 million per year would be in addition to the American Rescue Plan Act funding of $3.5 million. I will give two of the many reasons this would be good policy. First, the expansion of unarmed response will be another step forward in improving the quality of life in Ann Arbor.  Everyone benefits from living in a community where all people feel that others care for them. In the words of Martin Luther King Jr., quote, our goal is to create a beloved community, end quote. A beloved community is especially important to those who live with a serious mental health issue, those in poverty, and those bearing the brunt of racial, ethnic discrimination.  Second, the use of the millage funds for unarmed response would increase the chances the millage will be renewed. Many, and perhaps most, people believe a millage labeled mental health and public safety on the ballot should be spent on mental health and public safety services. The pressing need for better services in these areas reinforces their view.  The millage will expire after 2025, if not renewed or replaced. The replacement will probably be on the ballot in 2024. Now is the time for city policymakers to demonstrate that future tax revenues would be used for mental health and public safety services.

Kind of I was thinking about like I know there's a public hearing for the PUD and it just bums me out that we have to do all these  you know, one by one project things to get our badly needed housing in the city. And so I've also been hearing from a lot of people. I'm just getting more into urban planning and stuff like that and asking people what their favorite cities are that they visited and stuff like that. And the most common answer that I get is Paris.  believe it or not. And um...  I really don't have a lot of money. I don't travel. So I'm like, well, instead of me traveling to Paris and checking it out, what if we made Ann Arbor more like Paris? And so what we could do is maybe aim for one million Ann Arbor residents, which still would have a significantly lower density than Paris. We would need, I believe, like,  1.5 or 1.6 million people to have the same density of Paris. But we could have really lively neighborhoods with lots of... What I wanna see is a lot of bigger apartment buildings with first floor activated space and  I think we're seeing in the closed streets for the summer are really winning a lot of people over the benefits of having more tables outside at cafes and restaurants and more programming, games for kids and special events and stuff like that. That doesn't have to just be limited to downtown. There's other areas in the city. We could give families that  maybe don't want to, that live far out from downtown and don't want to bike ride all the way through to downtown or something if they have another kind of a track, activated area of the city closer to them. And it just brings more creativity, more different types of people, and  it will help the environment.

Look at your mayor, a big loud mouth for white Ukrainians. But never, never will you see him stand up for Palestinian rights. He has no heart.  Ann Arbor City Council has thrown its weight against every resolution for Palestinian rights for almost 40 years, since January 1984. Has this city council and this mayor ever looked at Palestinians as human beings? Ever? You tell me. As if there are rules for when you get to speak up for Palestinian human rights.  And the rule is never ever. The city council members sure seem to act like the rule is never ever. But 90 campus resolutions have broken that gag rule. Those resolutions insist on Palestinian human rights.  Amnesty International says Israel is committing the crime of apartheid against the Palestinian people. Human Rights Watch says so, too. Black Lives Matter says so, too. South Africa says so, too. And what the hell do you say? Not a goddamn thing. While Israel butchers the Palestinian people, you can't even make eye contact.

My first topic is CA-13.  which would authorize paying the Bodmin Law Firm another $150,000 to pursue litigation against Gelman. Since 2016, Bodmin has been paid $900,000 to fight Gelman, and in-house lawyers have spent countless hours. That has accomplished virtually nothing. And pursuit of state litigation also unfortunately resulted in delaying asking for EPA intervention by almost five years. Approving more fees is throwing good money after bad.  State law currently has no teeth. Further, pages 8 to 11 of the 2006 settlement agreement between the city and Gilman, negotiated by Bodmin, bars many types of claims that we might have, and they might be time-barred, too. You should be getting a second opinion. It's not appropriate to have Bodmin be the only one, since they'll benefit from going forward by getting paid, even if they lose.  And they did a bad job of telling you in the public about the infamous fourth CJ and the subsequent corporate process. Do you have a detailed memo explaining why these claims aren't barred? The agenda description does say part of the litigation will be enforcing the 2006 settlement agreement, that same agreement I just talked about. That's allowed under that agreement. Why couldn't that be done mainly in-house with minimal supervision from Bodmin? It seems a relatively discreet contractual matter rather than a complex environmental case.  Overall, this is a terrible waste of money, which Mr. DeHoney just said we need pretty bad. Next topic is the AC1 memo for a food truck at the comments. There are several positions in it which omit important facts or misleading or just wrong. Many of these are detailed in Julie Ritter's email to you yesterday, all of which I agree with. I'll focus on just a couple. The memo emphasizes the loss of parking revenue.  However, it seems that there isn't any lost revenue if there would be empty spaces in the underground lots during food truck events, and there typically are. Next, why couldn't the food trucks be charged the same amount for the space they take up? Next, under a 2019 resolution, parking revenue was actually supposed to be used to financially support the commons. That's been ignored, and the use of phantom loss of revenue as a reason not to allow activity on the commons is insulting, really, particularly when the 2018 Charter Amendment approved  was supposed to make this a commons. Obviously, that charter amendment is inconsistent with having cars park there permanently. This strange implicit argument in the memo would block any use other than parking. Finally, the statement that you need to get a detailed legal opinion rate commercial activity is not an indicator of the author's bias against the commons. Really, we've never had vendors allowed to get a permit on city property to sell things? Don't we have a street art fair?  My band is scheduled to play at the Commons this Saturday. Does that violate the charter? Should I worry about putting out a tip jar? It's facetious, partially, but really, do you think that the Prop A proponents, who by and large are the same people who want food trucks, are going to sue the city? This memo looks like it's the latest attempt to stall, stymie, and any activity and kill the Commons. It's shameful. Thank you.",Governance and Civic Engagement

I want to address several topics tonight, but before that, I'd just like to thank Administrator DeHoney for his fantastic budget presentation. First, I want to make a quick note on the comprehensive plan CA-14, if I remember correctly.  I'm glad to see progress happening on this. Given how many of the PUD requests we see in the Planning Commission recently have been for things that, frankly, should be allowed in the zoning already, the comprehensive plan should make a clear call for liberalizing our zoning so that we don't have all of this unnecessary process and require things to be PUDs. Let's fix that.  Right now, a lot of Ann Arbor landmarks would just be illegal to build. So we should change that so that we can build the next generation of landmarks. Second, about the Dioxin, it's clear to even the lay observer that the company who purchased Gelman Sciences is using every bit of procedural trickery available to distance themselves from this mess. So this is ludicrous.  So far, the city has taken only tentative and timid actions about this. But given that the health of everyone in the city is on the line here, it's time to be bold. Finally, the memorandum to council about food trucks at the library department. In short, it was flawed reading this. If I understand correctly, the Council of the Commons contains several members who were involved in the drafting of Proposal A.  Yet the first meaningful attempt that they've made to activate the space is legally questionable under the language of that very proposal. Add to this the fact that it comes over four years after Proposal A was voted on, and the whole center of the city claims starts to look like, honestly, a bit of a damp squib.  So I went back and watched a few Council of the Commons meetings, and I must say the experience has left me baffled as to how we have continued this for so long. What a brooding, nagging squandering of the city's limited resources. At a recent meeting, the two council liaisons rightly  who removed themselves from the call in protest of a massive breach of rules of order designed to prevent a single commissioner from monopolizing the commission's time. Unfortunately, that appears to have been the only consequence for this commission, despite numerous other breaches of civility and etiquette. So maybe it's time to rethink proposal A altogether.

The Council of Commons was created in 2020 to advise this body and help plan the creation of a public park on the library lot. What it's become is a dysfunctional, deeply divided body that's neither advising you nor effectively advancing that project.  The latest example of this is on your agenda tonight. That's a nine-page memo prepared by the city administrator, requested by the Council of the Commons on the viability of permitting food trucks on the library lot. Asking city staff to analyze whether food trucks are viable on the site is, to be clear, a desperation play.  It's the best option among bad options to activate a site that everyone understands to be undesirable. This is something they proposed back in 2021, and to quote one member, they just needed a win. The logic of using food trucks to draw people to gather on an unimproved parking lot has it exactly backwards, and there are a lot of reasons for that.  But it also won't work. A 10-year-old Parks Advisory Commission report explained to us, again, 10 years ago, why. The site doesn't have foot traffic. It's boxed in on three sides. And it needs infrastructure to function properly as a public space. Council Member Briggs, you will recall asking the library director at the Council of the Commons meeting in December about food trucks and activating that site with that activity. And he responded that they've had food trucks on that site.  And they're not profitable. So this isn't a hypothetical. We've tested this. The libraries put food trucks out there. They've had to subsidize that activity. And that's the conclusion reached by the administrator. But the dysfunction of this body goes deeper than that. The last Council of the Commons meeting, the members were discussing a draft design RFP that isn't ready to issue despite two solid years of planning. It's badly overdue. It hasn't been socialized with city park staff. And it was attacked most of the meeting by a member of the council.  who spent an eight-plus-minute diatribe attacking it that survived inexplicably multiple points of order by other members. This council has outlived its utility to the public, and unless it's given a deadline to wrap its work up, it's going to continue to flounder. It's going to bicker about the terms of this RFP that it's never going to issue, and then it's going to attempt to justify its own existence by making work for city staff.  pass a resolution suspending the work of this body effective June 1. Give them a month of runway to wrap up their work. Then let staff and council members who have been supporting this activity patiently focus more of their time on actually meeting pressing resident needs. Thank you.",Governance and Civic Engagement

I'm calling about CA-14, the resolution to authorize a professional services agreement with Interface Studio LLC for comprehensive plant services. I am looking forward to this process, as I'm sure many of you are, and as many people in the community are.  I speak from the perspective of someone who has been a real estate professional for over 30 years, including as a developer, and who is looking to the Comprehensive Plan and subsequent zoning changes for guidance on future development of properties that I, my investors, and my clients own. I participated in some previous Comprehensive Plan revision processes, such as the Northeast Area Plan, P2D2, and the Lowtown Comprehensive Plan, as well as observing Comprehensive Plan revisions that impacted properties that I developed in other communities.  I've written and spoken many times to city council regarding comprehensive plan issues and other zoning matters. It is my hope that through this process that we are about to embark on, that the public, city council and planning commission will all gain better understanding of how planning and zoning is supposed to work. We haven't done a great job over the past several years. This is not just my opinion, but the observation of multiple experts.  Our city council members and commissioners haven't received the training and professional guidance that they, and we as their constituents, deserve. This has led to a number of votes based on narratives and speeches rather than on the criteria laid out in our law. An attorney recently asked me what I want to see from our city. My response was that I wanted honesty, intellectual honesty, adherence to proper processes, respect for the law, both the letter and the intent of the law.  We have fallen short of a number of times over the past several years. We seem to prefer our narratives to establish processes, to adherence to the Michigan Zoning and Aging Act, and to adherence to our unified development code. Perhaps this extensive revision of the comprehensive plan will better educate us on how it should be done. I'd also like to mention a good article in the most recent observer regarding development issues and also PUDs.  Later tonight, I will speak regarding an application for a PUD that contains multiple misrepresentations, that doesn't comply with multiple federal and city policies, and that clearly violates the intent of the law, and that likely violates the letter of the law. Are PUDs good or bad or just a tool? It was several years ago that some planning commissioners and city council members and their supporters narrated was that PUDs weren't viable.  That narrative is tied to the inappropriate loss of $9 million in affordable housing funds and monetized lower town development, and a similar failed attempt at upzoning while avoiding obligatory affordable housing funds down the block from there occurring. I sincerely hope that the comprehensive plan revision process is a successful, eye-opening, and clarifying experience for us all.  process matters. I look forward to this comprehensive plan revision.

Anybody who has been watching him act knows that he has, he is the, he has most hatred for Arabs in this community.  Mayor Christopher Taylor has more hatred for Arabs in this community that can ever be described. For this city council and Mayor Christopher Taylor to pretend they like Arabs is like a gangster boss sending flowers to his victims' funerals.  Mr. Mayor, do you recall a few months ago, January 2023, when Arabs of this community protested and chanted, not a penny, not a dime, no more money for Israel's crimes? Do you remember those Arabs, Mr. Mayor, for whom you have declared your love?  Arabs in this community have for decades come to these chambers, have chanted, stop Israel, boycott Israel, do something about Israel. They are murdering us. They are torturing us. They are killing us.  And you, Mr. Christopher Taylor, have silenced them with the silence that you have created. You have supported Israeli crimes against Arabs. Those are Arabs they are killing in Palestine.  Those are Arabs. And Mr. Mayor, your behavior has exhibited the most outrageous hatred towards Arabs in this community. When you said that you care about community issues, when you were asked about Palestinians, you said this city cares about the community, excluding Arabs from this town. Well, there are many Arabs here, Mr. Mayor.  and you have silenced their voices. By the way, do you remember in 2021 when 3,000 Arabs, do you hear me? 3,000 Arabs showed up outside this building chanting the same slogan we have here, no more military aid to Israel. They were right outside of this building, Mr. Mayor, and they were Arabs.  those that you claim to love. And you have choked them. You have silenced them year after year, year after year. And Israel continues to massacre Arabs. Only in the past few weeks they have killed, they have tortured, they have sent people out of their homes.

AA_04_17_23,AA,"Ann Arbor, MI",2023-04-17,2023-04-01,Training,Public Comment,Commenter,4810.989,4992.126,"Good evening. Last October, I addressed council about the Ann Arbor School's compliance with Public Act 170, which mandates teaching of the Holocaust.  Since then, the school board was kind enough to provide me the requested information. I addressed the board last week and hoped that we were molding Ann Arbor students to become independent thinkers. I addressed council tonight with the same concern. The textbook used in our schools is World History Patterns of Interaction.  In the section on the Holocaust, our student first reads, the Nazis proclaimed that the Germanic peoples were a, quote, master race, end quote. I think we're all accustomed to that phrase. But I note that there's no attribution to that quote, no reference. Which Nazi leader said those words? There's no way for the student to know.  If the student were equipped with books that challenged that claim, such as Benton Bradbury's The Myth of German Villainy, he could read that no Nazi ever said those words. And if the student were encouraged to do so, he could download a copy of Mein Kampf by Adolf Hitler and could scan for Master Race. He won't find it, and he may be puzzled by the claim.  He may even conclude that master race was merely wartime propaganda in which all sides took part. On the same page, our student reads that the beginning of the Holocaust targeted Jews due to German failures. Some Germans even blamed Jews for their country's defeat in World War I, as if nothing could be further from the truth. But Alice and Weir's book, Against Our Better Judgment,  documents clearly that during that war, when Germany was about to defeat Britain, and had actually offered a negotiated peace, Zionist Jews engaged in the process of getting the U.S. into the war on Britain's side.  Prominent American Jews like Louis Brandeis and Felix Frankfurter worked behind the scenes to accomplish this task and were in fact successful at getting the Americans into the war, which ensured Germany's defeat. So what is ridiculed in the text our student reads is actually the true historic accounting of events.  I encourage the board, as I do counsel tonight, to provide our student with enough information to make up his mind independently and critically about historical events, and that he be provided with an array of viewpoints, not just one. Thank you.",Education and Youth Services

I appreciate this opportunity to speak before you tonight to talk about the center of the city. It's now approaching five years since Proposal A was passed and the sad truth is that we have very little to show for it. The request for proposals is still being worked on. The space has still not been activated in any meaningful sense.  City staff's analysis of what it would take to activate the space with food trucks and mobile vendors is damning, and the director of the Ann Arbor District Library has been very clear about the inherent challenges of using that space for library events. If and when the results of the RFP come in, any project approaching the drawing shared by Proposal A supporters will come at a cost of millions, or more likely tens of millions of dollars, and there is no source for that funding.  The ballot proposal included no funding component, and when Proposal A was on the ballot, the key supporters and organizers of the initiative assured us that city taxpayer money would not be required and that private money would flow in. Yet, it's taken us five years to finally put together the comparatively little funding just for the RFP.  I am therefore asking City Council members to take a hard and honest look at where the project currently stands in contrast to what the public was led to believe and the opportunity costs of allowing this process to continue. The people of Ann Arbor deserve better.  It's painful to think of what might have been. We could have had much needed housing. We could have had one or two floors of retail behind the plaza to create traffic flowing through it, making the space a space where people feel safe and relaxed.  In other words, we could have activated that space. We could have had a public closet that was privately maintained, and our city could have had revenue from the 100-year lease, from new property taxes, and from running a portion of the parking structure beneath. And our city's kids might have even had a seasonal splash pad and outdoor ice skating.  Please, take that hard and honest look and act boldly and realistically and find a new path beyond Proposal A to reinvent and activate this space. I believe the public would appreciate the chance to weigh in again, this time five years wiser. Thank you.",Urban Development

I'm the president of Ann Arbor for Public Power, and I live at 1012 West Cross. I'm here today to ask for one small addition to the budget that was just proposed by City Administrator DeHoney. Very much appreciate your excellent presentation on that.  The council may remember that back in January of 2022, the council approved a feasibility study into municipalization as well as some other energy options. That study was funded in September of 22, and it's going to be finishing here in about June of this year. We do not know the results of that study yet. However, if that study is positive, the next step would be to get a valuation of DTE's assets.  Ann Arbor for Public Power is suggesting that we reserve some amount of money in the budget to pay for that study should we decide to do it. We originally proposed $500,000 for that study. However, after talking to other communities that have done this study, they believe that it'd be considerably cheaper than that. So we're amending our proposal to $250,000 reserved to get a hard valuation of the assets.  What that valuation will do is it will help with the city's legal proceedings to be able to go to DTE with a good offer for the price of their assets should we decide to go through with the acquisition process. Mayor Taylor actually just gave an excellent interview where he outlined the process for moving forward with municipalization on state side. I'd definitely recommend all of you go and listen to that. And if any of you have any further questions or would like to discuss it more with us,  We're always happy to talk with you. Thank you all for your time.",Utilities

I've been a resident in Ward four since I moved here.  And I'm here today to talk about the so-called center of the city. The election where Prop A appeared on the ballot was the first election in Michigan that I was eligible to participate in. My parents raised me to be an active citizen, and I registered to vote as soon as I moved here and was eligible. I read all about, you know, the various elections happening. I read up about Prop A.  And I remember thinking, well, this is silly. It's obviously not going to pass. In particular, I remember reading a story, I think in the Observer, where they interviewed proponents and opponents of Prop A. And of the proponents picked were a couple who said that any building on the lot would block the view from their $500,000 condo. And I was really surprised when it passed.  However, I have sadly not been surprised by the complete lack of progress that the so-called Center of the City Commission has made. I recently saw a number of tweets about the work that wasn't being done at this commission.  people smoking and drinking during public meetings. Just last week, I was walking down Division downtown to meet a friend, and the only people I saw anywhere near that lot using it were people, were a couple of teenagers on skateboards, who were actually on their way to Liberty Plaza, because that seemed like a better place to be able to try and do, you know, kickflips or whatever.  City Administrator Dahomey's recent report outlining the many ways that quote unquote activating the center of the city as a place for  food trucks, was thorough, honest, and, you know, as a previous commenter said, damning. I would like to join several other commenters, both at this meeting and I think at others in the past, to ask Council to step in. I think that we would all, as Ann Arborites, love to have places to gather.  Senator, City Administrator Dahomey's description of a potential splash pad and community garden at the currently named Fuller Park, I'm sure has been met with lots and lots of enthusiasm. 30 seconds. But it's also backed up by actual planning and expertise, which the center of the city doesn't have. We need to put our money where our mouths are and use them for things that are important.

I am also calling in to ask Council to take action to address the lack of progress that we've seen at the library-laden surface parking lot. In the nearly five years since voters narrowly passed the Charter Amendment to turn that parking lot into a public commons, there's been next to no progress towards that goal. The site remains a surface parking lot, the city is out tens of millions of dollars, and we're further behind in building much-needed housing as a result.  If Prop A hadn't passed, we surely would have had a free, usable public plaza in the splash pad by now, along with $5 million more in the affordable housing fund. The current state of the site, as emphasized by AC1 on tonight's agenda, suggests that significant resources would be required to transform it into a suitable space for even hosting food trucks, resources that we are understandably hesitant to allocate. The last meeting of the Council of the Commons  At that meeting one committee member appeared to be fully baked while the committee discussed and at best half-baked RFP for the space. It also seems that Library Green have been sitting on funds for who knows how long that they simply chose not to spend to accelerate the RFP. If the beginning of a draft RFP and  maybe food trucks, is all the progress we've had in five years, it's time to cut our losses and move on. Whether we repeal Prop A entirely or replace it with something more flexible, I would like to see us put the issue to voters this year. The longer we wait, the worse it is for everyone involved. We must make a decision as soon as possible to be able to move forward. Thank you for your time.",Governance and Civic Engagement

I just like to add my name to the folks who've already speak and spoken about the center of the city tonight. I really think that it's time to re examine this and put a valid initiative to the voters to let us decide.  Once and for all, after everything that we've seen over the past four plus years, whether it's worth putting any more time, effort, and money into this broken initiative that we embarked on, ostensibly for a public plaza, but really to stop a development downtown. A lot of the supporters who remain after the development was stopped are still divided in purpose and scope.  Other than a small flower bed, maybe a handful of events over the four-plus years, this parking lot is much as it was, with no real plans to change it anytime soon. I think the city administrator's memo is correct, and I think his plans for the rest of the city sound really well thought out and wonderful, and in stark contrast to what this group has come up with. It's time to cut bait. There's a dawning recognition in our city  that we must adapt and change to meet the growing crises of climate housing. And if we're going to devote time and energy into something, then let it be that, not window dressing on a parking lot.  The only way to change the use for this lot now is by amending the city charter and putting it to the voters. And it's within your scope as our city's elected leaders to do just that. And I urge you to do it. Do it this year. Put a ballot proposal forward and let the voters decide. Either to maintain the status quo as it is now, or come up with a new, progressive use of this plot that is right next to  the bus depot near the library. Something better than a parking lot.

I sent this to Council as an email, but I wanted to call in and read it into the record. I read this astoundingly brutal, I might add, memo last night and was struck by three things. First, Proposal A was passed in 2018, and we're only now looking at options such as food trucks.  We're coming up on five years. Everything about the center of the city and Council of the Commons or whatever the correct style to refer to this is has had a lack of urgency. We are coming up on the bicentennial with nothing to show for it. The Council of the Commons is still working on putting together a design RFP after nearly five years. I watched the most recent meeting and it was a disaster with one member interrupting and monopolizing much of the discussion time with a list of 18 vague amendments.  Towards the end of the meeting, he appeared to, as our elders would say, toke up. Looking back on the minutes from previous meetings, it doesn't seem as if they report much back to council, and it isn't clear to me what they've been doing all this time. Second, $130,000 a year for food trucks, if we can even do food trucks with the poorly worded charter language Proposal A saddled us with, and if we can find operators willing to take us up on it.  And I'll just use the proposed ballot explainer text for this, quote, four, the charter amendment does not provide a funding source for the development, maintenance, or programming of a park and commons, unquote. We don't have money to put food trucks here.  Please put an end to this charade. Don't let it drag on for another year or five. Dissolve the Council of the Commons so they stop wasting staff time and the time of the two council members sitting on that body. They aren't seeming to act as an advisory body to council anyway, so I don't think we would be losing anything without their input.  Pass a ballot initiative that allows voters to fix the mistake of Proposal A. Either strike the language entirely or, preferably, modify it so that the space can be developed to provide a public plaza, housing, and money for city priorities, which could include affordable housing, climate, active transportation, unarmed response, debt service, et cetera.  I don't want this issue to still be hanging over our heads while we are supposed to be celebrating the bicentennial. It's time to move on. Thank you.",Urban Development

The previous speakers have done a wonderful job of covering many aspects of this. So I'm going to broaden what I'm going to say about it into what I see as a pattern, a pattern of deregulation and reduced oversight.  Now, I'm an entrepreneur, I'm a capitalist, I believe in capitalism, but I believe in regulated capitalism. I don't want the Wild West in capitalism, and I don't want the Wild West in government. Government has a role to play. As one of the speakers said, you are our representatives. Whenever you reduce the amount of oversight, public scrutiny, public hearings,  public information as provided. It reduces that window of the public, of the people you represent, of the citizens of Ann Arbor, into how our government works. This particular item has to do with a lot of money and a relatively infrequent amount of time that society needs to meet.  But it's very important. The whole function of the Southfield TIF aspect of cleaning up sites, especially orphan sites, is very valuable to get sites cleaned up that otherwise might not. But a lot of money changes hands. A lot of money, tax dollars, are involved. Public scrutiny should be not just allowed, but embraced.  Journalism is reduced these days, we all know that. Therefore, we need more public scrutiny, not less public scrutiny, whenever we have the opportunity. I believe dissolving this committee reduces the public scrutiny, reduces your helping us to have a window into how government works and how government deals with our tax dollars.  There have been some good things that have come out of the Brownfield tip in my neighborhood, in the Lower Town project. Unfortunately, $9 million of affordable housing went by the wayside with an improper decision. In the Brownfield tip, 15 units, 15 units of affordable housing. We lost 93, but we got 15 in a Brownfield negotiation. Just one small example of where a council member was proud of what he felt he negotiated.  into a brownfield active group financing situation.

I'm here to speak in favor of the unarmed crisis response and wellness check proposal with a personal story, a story of mental health. My wife and I married in 2018 and enjoyed two years as newlyweds, then COVID hit. In quarantine and also working from home, we spent 24 hours a day and seven days a week together for years.  Through counseling, we also learned that both my wife and I suffer from severe childhood trauma. For everyone in this room who has had a relationship or is in a relationship, I think can respect the fireworks that that recipe just cooked up. In the fall of last year, an argument rose to crisis level. For the first time, I was scared.  It was late on a Sunday evening when neither one of us could reach our counselors. I felt so over my head I called 911. A friend had recently told me about unarmed crisis wellness checks. I asked the dispatcher, please send an unarmed response team for a wellness check. 30 minutes later, three police cars arrived. We both cooperated, but I believed I was asked leading questions while in a vulnerable state for the purpose of making an arrest.  I don't fault the police. They were extremely compassionate and helpful. But because my wife had self-harmed and because I had a small cut and a bruise, my wife was arrested. But this is not a story with a sad ending. My wife and I got the counseling, we're in a great place together, and we're overcoming a lifetime of childhood trauma together. We've learned to support each other and are in a functioning and healthy marriage.  Spending the night in jail was extremely traumatic for my wife. It was also costly. Legal fees, logistics, hotel rooms, court costs put expenses over $10,000. But I can never erase the vision of my wife being walked to a patrol car in handcuffs, especially when I feel unarmed mental support was all I was calling for.  Although the case was dismissed, my wife still has an arrest on her record and I now fear for her citizenship. I loved reading the report.  On the unarmed crisis support team's status, last year it looked like money from the Federal American Rescue Plan Act was directed to the program. And according to a group called the Coalition for Revisioning Our Safety in Washtenaw County, that funding would allow the program to operate for the first year. Could that be the beginning? While other sources of funding are secured, I sincerely hope so.  I can start treating, if we can start, thank you.",Police Reform

As I was sitting there and these folks have been coming down here what 18, 19 years now.  And nobody even seems to. Yeah, I know. She's right. She's absolutely right. And I accept that. I accept her shaming. She's right. I don't mind that she's interrupting me. I had every chance to act on it, and I failed to act. And it's to my great shame that I did. I apologize to the Palestinian community here in Ann Arbor that I failed to act. Well, not here. So hopefully we can provide a world forum here. I'm here to talk about the dissolution of the Brownfield Committee.  the Brownfield Review Committee, which I sat on when I was on city council. And it actually occurred to me that it occurred to me that I think the mayor and I are the only two people in this room that have served a full term here in this chambers. And for certain, I'm sat on more of those Brownfield meetings than anybody else here in this room. There's no doubt about it. And I think it's shameful to use the terms of our previous speakers that you're going to get rid of this committee, that you're going to  take the trust that the electors of the city, all 121,000 some of us, gave to this body to oversee these important programs that have long-term implications for the health of our economy, that are economic tools that can be used for good, that are environmental tools that when used properly can be used for good. And you're going to punt and shirk your responsibility. You're going to  really set aside the public's trust in what you can do here at this table. And I think we've had pushing $90 million in tax, you know, foregone taxes.  in the last six years. That's a lot of money we've given away. And I I do a I do a loop a couple loops every day around where they're doing the Mishcon job which is use some tax credits down there on the Mishcon site. And you know the Mishcon site and some other sites here in our community have responsible parties. There is no way that we should be giving away tax dollars when there's a responsible party. And some of the mayor's toadies I've run into on my walks around there  And they don't have a clue what this is about. They say, isn't it great that they're cleaning this up? Well, the they is us. We're the they. Our tax dollars are cleaning this up. And you wanna shed that to the county? You want the county to be the ones to decide that? So that nine people, only three of which have any kind of geographic relationship to the city limits, are gonna make those decisions for you? It's shameful.  And I would like everyone to hear, I would like before they say yes or no to this, to tell us why it is you don't think that the body that is charged in the law, the local unit of government, doesn't get to have a say in this, and thereby the 120,000 people that you represent.",Governance and Civic Engagement

So, as I was saying, I understand why you  might want to dissolve the Brownfield Plans Review Committee tonight on the basis of efficiency and a streamlined process. And I agree with that general aim. Right now developers pass through a convoluted review process that's inflexible and needs fixing. But the Brownfield Committee is not part of the problem. And as I was saying, I checked and over the last ten years the committee has met exactly twelve times. Barely once a year on average. Sometimes some years not at all. This is not a burden.  Brownfield plan oversight is critical, not so much the site remediation activities. These are vetted by technical experts, but the non-environmental activities need close scrutiny. Here the city is using the Brownfield plan not to clean up a site, but rather to advance other goals.  It's sometimes appropriate to reward developers with a brownfield tax credit for doing something non-environmental that benefits the public. But this is tricky. There is no clear line between a useful tax trade-off and a taxpayer giveaway to the developer. We need to be mindful of bad policy, overpaying, and favoritism. Staff negotiates these deals out of public view so they require sunlight.  And once adopted, TIF tax credits are invisible. They don't show up in property tax bills, on millages, or in the city budget. The affected government entities, city, county, school board, district library, and mental health, often don't even know that they're missing the millage revenue, which can run into the millions just for non-environmental. The city is effectively deciding for all these entities. That's another reason for strict oversight.  So these plans, especially the non-environmental elements, need careful scrutiny on the front end. That's why council voted unanimously in April 2003 to establish the review committee. Please keep it intact. This is a very capable city council. But you simply do not have the time or the bandwidth at your meetings to fully vet these complex and opaque plans.  You may argue that the city's brownfield policy, adopted in 2019, reduces the need for review. In fact, it adds a layer of complexity that makes separate review even more important. By dissolving the committee, you are also eliminating one of two chances for public comment. In conclusion, this committee poses no burden  and provides needed oversight for the discretionary removal of millions in taxpayer dollars from the tax rolls for non-environmental purposes. Please do not dissolve it tonight. Thank you for considering my comments.",Governance and Civic Engagement

I would echo the comments by the two preceding speakers. I think they were well thought out.  I just want to say this, the committee currently has the task of reviewing multi-million dollar brownfield TIF plans, one to a year. One of the policy standards previously set is that a developer asking for TIF dollars for non-environmental items has to give a percentage to affordable housing. The committee recently, including some new members,  Matt overrode a staff recommendation of denial on the village project because the developer didn't propose any housing dollars in return for the non-environmental items, and then recommended dissolving itself. I understand that Council Member Song said a while back, essentially, don't worry about this. The county also has to approve and does its own due diligence, so there's other regulatory bodies here. The county just recently met,  On the same village project, several commissioners said, essentially, we should defer the city. So it appears that's really not a viable solution. It's our oversight, the city's oversight, that is going to essentially be potentially rubber-stamped by the county. And the commissioners essentially said that. And so did the person in charge of that for the county. These are big dollar projects. This is big affordable housing dollars.  I think shirking responsibility to carefully review these plans is a mistake. Next topic, the Brooks Street construction. The first issue, the bid process. There have been some past discussions, some heated, of the best value policy. There were often memos describing the bid amounts along with the differences in contract to practice.  To be transparent, we should be able to see the additional amounts we're paying over the low bid and what we're presumably getting for those extra dollars. But all the contracts on today's agenda, at least as far as I could tell, don't have that information. They just have the raw scores. That's a pretty good way to prevent any critiques of the bid process. You can't see the additional dollars and you have to guess what the perceived value was.  On several recent contracts, the deciding factor was worker development. What was that? An apprenticeship program maybe? Better training? Isn't the public entitled to have some idea of what we're actually getting for the extra dollars? As to the project itself, I live a block away. I just hope that the promise will be kept is that there will be some curb bump-outs to save some of the dozens of mature trees which are in the past for both sidewalks.  I walk that street regularly and with no safety concerns and I'll be sad if all the trees are cut down to say nothing of the last climate benefits of having it.

I'd like to respond to the rather personal comments I received from council members when I spoke here on April 17th.  I do not wish to respond in kind. Rather, I come before you tonight with understanding. I've spoken about the Holocaust at least a dozen times prior to this evening. No council member, past or present, has corrected any of the claims made during those 12 appearances. How do most people, myself included,  come to understand this historical event. I offer Casablanca, Sophie's Choice, and Schindler's List. I also offer the Holocaust museums we have locally and nationally, and the constant reminders the press reiterates again and again. My friend refers to this as the mighty Wurlitzer, spinning the same songs over and over.  In other words, we have been coaxed, not logically convinced into our knowledge, in quotes. And as they say, you cannot argue a person out of a position they didn't argue themselves into. When people are presented with facts that run counter to what they assume they know, a great cognitive dissonance sets in.  Have two choices, either consider what is being said to have possibilities of being true, or assault the character of the person saying them. It's human nature, not necessarily mean spiritedness. Consider the first choice, I'm sure you all have. What happens if one of you says publicly that there might be some merit in Henry's words?  Words to date that have not been challenged. Do you really think you'll win re-election? Look what happened to Ali Ramlawi after he accepted a small donation from me. He's no longer here. What if one of you votes to suspend military aid to Israel? I think we all know the answer. Reasonable people can disagree.  using reason and not emotions. And I hope that as I continue to address this vital topic, reason and logic, along with respect, will prevail. Thank you.",Israel-Palestine

Hi council, I am one of the many in our community who knew Jude Walton and counted on her to be community engaged, honest, forthright, generous and solutions oriented and compassionate.  In that spirit, I'm here to ask you to create a city task force on gender-based violence. There is no denying that Jude's murder was the result of gender-based violence. There is no denying that our city has failed to seriously address this pervasive problem. It is long past time to take action.  Sexual assault is the only crime, violent, or property in which our city has a higher incidence rate per capita than the rest of Michigan and the country at large. That rate has increased over the last 10 years. 43% of U.S. women experience some form of sexual violence. One in three U.S. women experience some form of physical violence. That's over 20,000 women each impacted in this city.  Black, indigenous, people of color, transgender, non-binary, and lower-income citizens experience higher rates of gender-based violence along with increased severity, duration, and fatality.  Prior incidents of gender-based violence is the single greatest predictor of mass shootings. 63% of all mass shooters have histories of gender-based violence. Aggression towards women, including stalking, harassment, as well as physical violence, is predictive of other violent crime.  I understand that domestic violence victim services are provided by outside agencies, usually at the county level. I am not calling for duplicating those services, I am asking for prevention. A city resident who feels unsafe calls city emergency responders. Jude once called the police department for aid when an ex was refusing to leave her home. They wouldn't intervene until a man with influence in the city called and demanded action on her behalf.  Over 10 years ago, I remember Jude complained about people using her backyard as a shortcut to West Park from Delanus and downtown. When she and neighbors applied for a fence permit, they were denied because their homes were in a floodplain. Her murderer accessed her home from the rear and was staying at Delanus. Please take a moment to let that sink in. Those are just two stories from Jude's experience. There are more which signal opportunities  lost to increase her safety as a single woman living alone. And there are so many more citizens with story of gender-based violence and harassment to tell. Each of those stories could lead to an action at the city governance level that would show we as a city are willing to step up to the challenge of responding adequately to the risk posed to vulnerable citizens.  The research is abundant. The funding for this work at the state and federal level is abundant. We have a community capacity and expertise. We have gender-based violence programs at every level of government except in this city. Thank you. Do we have the will? What would you do in your place? Please honor her legacy by seriously considering this request. Thanks.",Public Safety and Law Enforcement

I'm an Ann Arbor resident for almost 40 years, a fourth generation Michigander. And tonight, I am urging all of you here to exercise courage.  Please speak unanimously with one clear voice. Ann Arbor will stop permitting investments in toxic and climate disrupting gas infrastructure. No vote, or not even bringing a vote before us,  is a no vote. It's a no vote on climate action that we absolutely urgently require. We're in a declared climate emergency. We have an A20 goal of powering our grid with 100% renewables by 2030. There is no possible way that we can even approximate this goal unless we stop permitting investment in fossil fuel infrastructure right here in Ann Arbor.  We need to electrify everything and power it with renewables and efficiency. We at Washtenaw 350 have a motto. When you're in a hole, first stop digging. Gas infrastructure is a huge, gaping hole, perhaps the largest that we here can control. We need to cut that off immediately.  Today I just read that in a part of southern France there are three communes that have no water. That's 3,000 people who have no water. There are forest fires raging in those areas that don't normally even start until maybe July or August. And they've cut off water for everything except for hygiene and emergency medical use. No agriculture. That's today.  The Energy, Environmental, and Renters Commissions have all passed resolutions calling for no new gas infrastructure for new and substantially remodeled buildings. Please schedule and vote yes on a gas ban. You, as council members, are the only ones who have the ability to make this policy a reality. Please.

I was enlightened by Ken Garber's description of the Brownfield Plan Review Committee's infrequent meetings. I think I've been to two of those 12 meetings over the span of the last 10 years. I remember waiting a long time for minutes for some of them.  One of the things that I think he brought up and I'll repeat is just the relatively light administrative burden for this committee relative to the relatively large sums being expended on brownfield remediation and the tax dollars that go with that.  A couple hours a year of oversight and a couple hours a year of listening to public commentary on these sorts of efforts seems like a good investment.  The challenge with brownfields is that as a city we tend to forget what came before us. We forget that there was a chemist living at and doing his chemical experiments at what is now the Science Center. We forget where all of the landfills and dumps were. We just forget. People from a hundred years ago are not around now to tell us.  where not to go. And so we're rediscovering or discovering, or like some people know of course, but most people don't, just how expensive it is to take land that we've destroyed and bring it back up to a space where it can be reused. And I think just for the public stewardship of the land that's under the city's orbit, I think it's a good idea to keep this  keep this function visible. I did look for other organizations that also have brownfield oversight, and I did find the county, which does a pretty credible job of meeting on a regular basis and reporting on, on a regular basis, their efforts. An equivalent web search of the city website was not as anywhere near as useful. So I guess the request is if you're  If you're going to decide to remove the review committee, my ask would be please put a mandate to report out on brownfield activities on perhaps an annual basis to describe the locations under use and the funds expended or not collected and make sure that people can keep tabs on bad decisions of the past and hopefully remediate it in the future.

In just the last week, you saw on the news Israel blowing down whole buildings, blowing down homes, murdering children in their beds while they slept. You saw all that on your TV news. This is what Israel does with your military aid, with your tax dollars, with your $3.8 billion every year.

What happened to Vincent Chin, where he was murdered with impunity, happens every day in occupied Palestine, paid for by your tax dollars.

Second, I want to thank council members Garzi Edwin, Regina, Harrison, Watson, and Dish for sponsoring the resolution to designate Southeast Area Park as the 2024 Bicentennial Park. This park is both well used and very undervalued by the city, and I hope that we can change  Next, I'd like to ask the city to modify the fiscal year 2024 budget. First, we need to redirect some of that police budget to unarmed response. There's a $1.75 FTE increase for the police. Let's give that to unarmed response instead. Additionally, there's $800,000 on the budget for a replacement fire engine. This is great.  But I think that we should direct the fire department to purchase a much smaller fire truck, like we're starting to see in cities like San Francisco and London and Tokyo.  The current ones that we've got are massively oversized and do not fit on properly human scale streets, which just forces more impermeable surface in a new development, just because the only fire trucks that are available are these monstrosities.  And finally, I want to talk about the PUD on South Forest. I hope that this passes, but the fact that this has to be a PUD shows that our zoning is not working. This should not be a PUD. This should be a buy-write development. Let's fix our zoning so that more developments like these can happen buy-write. Thank you.",Governance and Civic Engagement

Just briefly, I'm on the agenda to speak about the enactment of Resolution R-22-363. Six months ago, this body and five people who are sitting here tonight voted in favor of a resolution directing our city administrator to investigate the establishment and funding of an office of the ombudsperson for the city of Ann Arbor, which I think would take care of a lot of the concerns that people have, the community have, about the poor customer service here at City Hall. And that's not me making something up. It's in your reports if you read them.  And that resolution that was passed by the body resolved that the city administrator report back these findings at a regular council meeting prior to the finalization of the budget, which is tonight. And that didn't happen as far as I know. I didn't see anything about that. And I don't see a place where we're in the budget. Now we had, I know there's potentially like some short memories on here, but one effort of this body should be to see what the previous body had to do. And there should be some effort at continuity, especially when it's something that's for the good of the whole community.  So, you know, we'll write it off to short memories and hope that you have this opportunity to change and get that forward tonight. Otherwise, we're going to write it off to the considerations that maybe this body isn't trustworthy. Now, I got a chuckle when I heard the mayor stand up here and say that he stands for constant expressions of pluralism. And when I spoke at our last meeting, I was not unfortunately interrupted by these good advocates behind me to speak  about no US military aid to Israel. And I do not support military aid to Israel. And I would call for it myself. And I do not support military aid to any country. And the United States has been handing out $12 billion or so every year for the last decade that we know about in direct purchases or funneled through third parties. And essentially what the United States does with this money, Israel or any other country, is prop up the small arms industries.  And so when I go downtown and I see the moms demand action against firearms down there, and I say moms should be demanding action against all military aid anywhere, because all that is doing is propping up our small arms industries. We sent billions and billions of rounds of ammunition, millions of rounds of ammunition, everything, all over the world. It's disgusting. And that's just what we know about. That's the overt operations. So that this body can't come forward and make a general statement against war. If you're not working for peace, if one isn't working for peace, what are we working for here?  It's the basis of everything. And on this day, on May 15th, it's especially so. And so I want to apologize to the Palestinian community for not taking my opportunity when I sat at that table to bring forward a resolution. But as these folks have been pointing out for some years, you can see what I would have been up against there. So I doubt that it would have even been discussed. Now I got to comment on something. We got a big call to defund the police. The average police department has 2.4 people for every 1,000 residents. We have one.  2.4 officers, we have one officer for every 1000 residents. This city only has 97 police officers. Okay. They're complaining about the state, the police state. Yes, state power is a danger. Well, then no more military aid to Israel or anybody else. Get rid of the state power. If you want to defund the police, get the arms out of our community and out of the world.",Governance and Civic Engagement

But you can't have a well community or safe community unless you have a well community. And we know well communities happen one individual at a time.  And the way we think about wellness is the majority, if not all, of our community members, our neighborhood members, are physically, psychologically, and emotionally healthy. We know food insecurity and housing insecurity is not a challenge in our neighborhoods. Well communities happen when we have robust transportation. It happens when we have neighborhoods that are as best as we can get at trauma-free.  And we have to make sure that we not only do that to the people that are outside that don't get impacted by our training and legal systems, but those that do. And everybody should have hope and the opportunity to be a contributing member of the community. And we know the impact of incarceration on folks and how it sometimes can derail them from realizing their own potential. I think $400,000 as a result of this excise act and the benefit from this excise act  is a small investment towards what we hope to be this continuing effort to put people on the path to contributing to the community, making our community safe by making our community well.

My name's Derek Miller, resident of Ward 4 and executive director of Community Action Network. I'm here today to advocate for the inclusive and transformative celebration of Ann Arbor's bicentennial.  As we commemorate two centuries of growth, progress, and community spirit, I urge you to consider the Southeast Area Park as a perfect location for a thrilling and much-needed splash zone or other park amenities. As stated in the resolution to direct the City Administrator to designate Southeast Area Park as the 2024 Bicentennial Park. Why Southeast Area Park? It is a beacon of opportunity for the residents of Southeast Ann Arbor, the largest concentration of low-income individuals in our city.  This community deserves not only commemoration, but tangible investments that uplift their lives. By choosing Southeast Area Park as specified in the resolution, we have the chance to create an accessible and empowering space for families, children, and individuals who may have limited recreational options. Moreover, the presence of Community Action Network, also known as CAN, in this area further highlights the significance of Southeast Area Park. CAN serves three under-resourced neighborhoods in this area, and these communities would directly benefit from the creation of this park and its amenities.  Ken has expressed his commitment to coordinating visits to this amazing amenity, ensuring that children and families who face economic barriers can experience the joy and respite it offers. But let us not forget that there is also still an incredible need for human services support in this area. Just today, Ken's largest food distribution at Bryan Community Center ran out midday and will not be replenished until Wednesday. Sadly, this has become a common occurrence by designating Southeast Area Park as the 2024 Bicentennial Park  We have the opportunity to address not only the need for recreational spaces, but also urgent need for vital services. We can send a powerful message to our community that our community stands united in supporting our most vulnerable residents. Moreover, Southeast Area Park's strategic location near multiple neighborhoods and various busing options ensures that families from different parts of the city can access the water park with ease.  Transportation should never be a barrier to enjoyment, and by selecting this part, as outlined in the resolution, we make a bold statement of our commitment to equitable access for all residents, regardless of their socioeconomic circumstances. Let us seize this occasion, the bicentennial celebration, to make a lasting impact on our community. I implore you to consider the long-lasting benefits, the positive impact on marginalized populations, and the opportunity to foster a sense of unity that transcends socioeconomic context. As outlined in the resolution,  to choose Southeast Area Park as the home for the Bicentennial Park and let us celebrate our history by creating a future that is truly inclusive, vibrant, and accessible to all.

I'm calling about something that I heard City Administrator DeHoney say at the May 9th meeting of the Ann Arbor Council Administration Committee.  This is a meeting that was broadcast audio only. It was not on Zoom, nor was it televised. Mr. DeHoney spoke about his plan for the city to build market rate housing next to City Hall. He had mentioned this when he gave his budget presentation to City Council about a month ago, but he went into more detail on May 9th. Now, I'm going to quote Mr. DeHoney. He said, quote,  Assuming that we get past the budget on Monday and Council doesn't say don't do it. Starting May 16th, I'm off."" Then, Mr. DeHoney clarified exactly what the proposed development would look like.  Quoting Mr. De Coney again, he said, quote, it's high end, market rate, high level finishes. You want to charge as much as possible. You want this thing to generate as much cash as possible. That's why I did not say let's use it for affordable housing, unquote. Let me repeat what he said because it shocked me when I heard it. He said, and listen carefully,  It's high end, market rate, high level finishes. You want to charge as much as possible. You want this thing to generate as much cash as possible. That's why I did not say let's use it for affordable housing, unquote.  I'd like to hear more about Mr. DeHoney's plan, and I want him to explain how this fits into our city's need for affordable and workforce housing. We have a lot of high-end market-rate housing in our city already. Do we really want our tax dollars to pay for even more of that? I know I don't. What about you? Mr. DeHoney says his plan is a way for the city to raise money. He wants to put the same high-end housing on the Klein lot.  But I've seen the city play developer before, and we end up losing money on that scheme. Maybe Mr. Gahoney doesn't know about that. Somebody should fill him in. I think probably a lot of the new council members, probably everybody on council now doesn't know about when the city tried to play developer before, but it didn't end up well.  Instead, why don't we try to live within our means and realign our priorities? For example, Council Chambers was redone just seven years ago. Does it need to be redone again now with a mural on the ceiling, really? This is only one example. I'm sure we could find many more. Thank you.",Housing

And I'd like to wear some different hats tonight, as I often do. As a landlord, I'd like to talk about E4, the Renter's Commission's recommendation.  Support your renters. They're the lower power people in the equation between renters and landlords. Some landlords have found workarounds. I guess the new laws for protecting renters are going to need some iterations, so please pay attention to the Renter's Commission and the recommendations as far as wait lists and other workarounds. Also, the Renter's Commission, I'll speak on E2 and E4 both, because the Renter's Commission  has advocated for sustainability, as has the Environmental Commission and the Energy Commission, and they all have resolutions before you dealing with natural gas for both heating and for appliances. And I'm sure you've read the details of those various resolutions. Whatever we do, we must do something more than what we are currently doing. And we must do so promptly.

And as they ask, please, with equal urgency, implement carrot and stick measures to promote sustainable construction. As a landlord and property owner of multiple smaller properties, not any large projects, we're trying to implement various things and learning as we go. I just read another article today that talked about ways  that can overcome some of the hurdles we've been facing in our investigations on how to implement air source heat pumps into our properties. We're doing what we can, and I know a lot of people are doing what they can, and citizens are doing what they can, and citizen groups are doing what they can to educate ourselves and to improve what we have in terms of our existing housing stock. It is essential for our new housing stock to not  put us into a hole that we cannot fall out of if we're going to meet our 820 goals by 2030. So please, listen to those resolutions. Also, on C1, I'll put on my developer's hat. C1 is the 721 South Forest PUD re-zoning. Staff recommends that the PUD zoning district be denied because it's not consistent with the comprehensive land use plan. The proper process would be  Revise the plan for that area.

I'm here to ask you to approve C1, also known as the 721 South Forest PUD. If constructed, this will replace a 50-unit run-down apartment building and parking lot with a development that has 733 bedrooms, a couple hundred bike parking spots, and even some retail.  It's an all-electric building, just like we've been requesting from developers, and will provide $4.7 million to the Affordable Housing Fund. Despite being less than a block from other dense housing near campus, and advancing Council's stated goals of building environmentally friendly mixed-use developments to help alleviate the housing crisis, the staff report recommended against approval, and planning was split 6-2, but in favor.  I attended the meeting and read the documents, and the objections seemed to be that the project wouldn't be appropriate for the area by the letter of existing council policy. Maybe that's true, but it feels like it fits to me. On a recent bike ride through the area, I stopped in front of the parking area of the existing building, and I can see a number of taller buildings without really even having to squint.  A seven-story parking structure is basically across the street, and there are similar tall buildings another half a block away. The building would fit in the area just fine. I hope council approves this PUD today, but if you do, this tells me that there is a mismatch between what council and staff and planning believes is our policy on building dense housing close to downtown and campus.  Every time there's a mismatch like this, I think it's worth examining if there are simple policy changes we can make before doing the entire comprehensive plan to set reasonable expectations for these sorts of projects. I don't know what that would look like in detail, but I hope that there's something short term we can do akin to a quick build transportation project that doesn't require years of process to implement. Doing these as one-off PODs is pretty inefficient. There's got to be a better way. Please set some kind of policy.  so that we get what we want and we need. And ask yourselves, why did this have to be a PUD every time you see one of these come through? Thanks.",Urban Development

I'd like to express my support for amendments two and three of DS-3. These amendments will allow us to better support some of our most vulnerable neighbors in our local community. These resources are especially important considering we're seeing both increases in both acuity and the number of people seeking services over the past year.  This past winter alone, we saw an increase of almost 20% of those seeking overnight shelter, and now almost 70% of our guests we serve have a disability, more often than not being a serious chronic health condition, with many coming out of the hospital or other settings. These amendments allow us to target additional resources to returning citizens and those impacted by the criminal justice system, helping address systemic barriers and the impact of systemic racism.  I appreciate that these amendments highlight utilizing a trauma-informed lens as well, giving special attention to the incredibly challenging circumstances our guests go through every day, and the importance of bringing an empathetic and client-centered approach that focuses on addressing that trauma. I do want to point out one specific item in Amendment 3, recommending that the service population be expanded to not just those who already have a tenant-based voucher, but also to provide support for those returning citizens with seeking  obtaining and identifying a tenant-based voucher. That would broaden the service array, and I think the voucher process is really hard to navigate, so providing additional support on the front end would be a huge boon. I want to give a special thank you to Councilmembers Briggs and Harrison for reaching out recently over the last few weeks to explore ways to better serve some of our most vulnerable neighbors, and thank the entire Council for bringing these amendments forward to support  some of our most vulnerable neighbors here in our community.

It's kind of hard to follow Holocaust deniers and Jew haters, but I'm going to give it a go.

On item DC3, I believe, Ivan, it is telling that the Council of the Commons voted to dissolve itself during their last meeting.  as I find it indicative of the ineffectiveness and dysfunction of the COTC as a body and of the process overall.

In addition, I'm encouraged by the city's efforts to improve Liberty Plaza, which, from my observations of COTC meetings, was neglected and pretty much an afterthought.

I live at 2340 Georgetown, and I am the current president of the Orchard Hills Maplewood Homeowners Association, a neighborhood bordering the Plymouth Road corridor.  I agree there is value in public transportation along major corridors. I understand that public transportation must be subsidized. I would support transportation nodes with mixed use if paired with a better transit system. I might support increasing density along corridors with existing transportation.  If the regulations were written to respect certain characteristics of those corridors, which TC1 does not do. I don't think one size fits all. Plymouth Road is not at all like State and Eisenhower, which had no natural features and no residential neighbors. Plymouth Corridor residents already live in a 15 to 20 minute walkable neighborhood. I think significant natural features, trees, wetlands, creek sheds like the Miller Creek are too valuable to our health  and well-being to be replaced. Traffic and pedestrian safety is vitally important, yet there's no plan to address this yet. Heights of TC1 buildings should not shade the backyards of adjacent residential lots.  I know Council has a vision for the future, but most Ann Arborites don't know that yet. I expect that could change during the public engagement portion of the rewrite of the comprehensive plan. What I don't understand is what made this resolution necessary. What is the urgency of this? What steps are considered extraneous? Does this mean you want to rezone these two corridors without any further public engagement?  What is the reason for outlawing any improvements in the ordinance before passing more mass zonings with what we know is a flawed ordinance? This resolution seems urgent, vague, and perhaps misleading. It sends a message that seems to say  We need to pass this before the comprehensive plan gets going and the public have a chance to alter it. Something is wrong here. I don't expect Council to always agree with me or any other resident. However, I respect, I expect respect, an opportunity for dialogue and an effective effort for addressing residents' concerns.  This resolution signals not caring to know what the public thinks because you have a vision and you fear it might fail if you inform the public. If your vision is right, let the voices of the public incorporate their ideas. You will convince them. After all, we, the public, are the stakeholders here. Thank you.",Transportation and Mobility

Some of you I have not addressed before, but many of you I have on many occasions. I'm speaking in relation to the resolution you have before you to disband the Council of the Commons. And actually, I voted against that resolution and announced a minority report.  I would say the political process has processed the people's vote out of existence. The Commons is removed from the entirety of the Central Park and Civic Center Commons.  in the resolutions and work that the Council of the Commons has put forward, they have eliminated that sense. The central idea of this, that the Commons is commonly pooled resources self-managed by the users.  This is what was demonstrated to the effect of the Nobel Prize in economics as the most effective way of organizing commonly poor resources. More effective than having the government, more effective than having a private profit corporation when the users  manage the resources, they are better managed, more productively, and more happily. And besides just taking out that idea, they also have reduced the notion to a plaza, not a Central Park, and the entirety of the idea of a civic center is removed, a ceremonial meeting place, a visitor center for people coming to Ann Arbor.  A place where there's a reference to the historic history and via region and location of Ann Arbor and its history. The sense that there is a food system here producing a cafe that honors the food producers of this area. The civic  a performance space appropriate for like the comic opera, one of the first signers of the petition for the commons. A preference  A way to have a meeting place and a connection place for social services. That's another function of a civic center, removed from the consideration. And a place for the fostering of a culture of peace and nonviolence, which is one of the recommendations that came out of the task force. And a place for the volunteers who do the comments to work together. All this is eliminated. I guess I'm done.",Governance and Civic Engagement

After distributing my address to council on April 17 to a wider audience via email and Facebook, I received a reply from Diane King of Texas. She was going to disseminate my address to her email list and cautioned me against using the word Nazi, claiming it a derogatory term.  She wrote, we abhor this term. The Germans never referred to themselves that way. It's equivalent to the other ethnic slurs that are verboten, but it's okay to disparage Germans. I already knew that the term Nazi originated from a country bumpkin reference to Germans, a slur based on the common farm boy or simpleton name, Ignaz, and the shortening of that name to Nazi.  This knowledge was supplied by Benton Bradbury's book, The Myth of German Villainy. But I did not know that national socialists never referred to themselves by that name. In my ignorance, I thought everyone used the term. I asked myself whether Diane could be correct and asked the Facebook public for evidence to counter her claim.  I wanted to be shown a reference by a German National Socialist who used the term Nazi in a correspondence or speech. I ask anyone here if they have corroborative evidence of National Socialists describing themselves as Nazis.  No one on Facebook supplied such information. One respondent, though, alerted me to an article that explained exactly what Diane was claiming. The article reports that a powerful Jewish journalist named Conrad Hayden popularized this term in the 1920s as an epithet  meant to degrade members of the National Socialist Workers' Party of Germany. Apparently, this name-calling stuck. We are left with the impression that everyone used the term because we, mistakenly, are continuing to use it.  Two takeaways. One, people in groups should be referred to as they deem fit. How would our black community react to being referred to by the N word? How would our Jewish community appreciate being called the K word? I doubt either group would appreciate it. It wouldn't be right.  Second takeaway, perhaps the successful name calling technique was yet another reason why German Jews were found in disfavor by their countrymen. Thank you.",Governance and Civic Engagement

Do you think it will make any difference to our esteemed mayor here,  Mayor Taylor, would it make any difference to him? It would not make any difference to him. Would it make any difference to Ms. Ghazi here, who is on this Human Rights Commission? Would this murder of a two-year-old make any difference?  Would it make them say no military aid to Israel? I doubt that. The reason is that they have no heart and they're racist. For 20 years we've come here, we have said, stop giving billions of dollars each year to that racist state that is called Israel. They have not even talked about this resolution that we've brought to them.  Thousands of people have signed petitions. Thousands of people have protested outside of this building. They will not do it. And the reason is they are racist, and they care nothing for Ann Arbor or for people of Palestine. Do you think if they gave a rat's ass about people of Ann Arbor, they would have pushed African-American community in this city out? No. With their policies, they have done that.  We've lost the black community in this town. They've moved out because they can't afford it. They have made sure the luxury housing is up, but everyone else can go die. That is their recipe for the rest of us. These people do not represent the public. They represent those who have given them, Mr. Mayor here, $90,000 to get back into his seat.

I'm calling in support of the coalition for re-envisioning our safety, also known as CROWS. I have read the community engagement report by public sector consultants and I'm here to urge the city council to prioritize the following three key findings in that report. Firstly,  to fund the unarmed public safety response from existing budget resources. Personally, I believe that some or all of this funding should be taken out of the existing policing budget. The city's commitment of ARPA funds to an unarmed response program is a great start, and ongoing, sustained funding from the existing police budget would be a great way to ensure this program remains robust, care-based, and accessible to all Ann Arbor residents. To me, this would demonstrate the city's commitment to addressing the root causes of conflict and crisis.  Secondly, the RFP should require the establishment of a separate number for unarmed response. A dedicated number for unarmed response can help streamline services, ensure appropriate response to non-emergency situations, and alleviate the burden on the 911 system. Third and finally, the RFP should insist on the exclusion of police from the unarmed response program.  The program should focus on unarmed professionals for non-violent situations to reduce the risk of unnecessary use of force, as well as to enhance community trust and to encourage more effective community-based solutions. By ensuring a non-police response, the unarmed response program could be safely utilized by more people while simultaneously reducing the number of calls police are responding to.  Reducing the number of police responses will alleviate the burden on Ann Arbor police while freeing up existing police funds for other safety-promoting programs in the city. I kindly request that the City Council take these findings into consideration when assessing the RFP for unarmed response and moving forward with its release. Also, while I have this opportunity to speak, I would also like to extend my wishes for a happy Pride Month to all those who are being celebrated this June.  I'd like to recognize that LGBTQ plus individuals are disproportionately affected by poverty, costlessness, criminalization, and mental health crises.

I am particularly pleased to see that three key findings in the report align with Crow's values and I urge the City Council to prioritize the following. So first, funding unarmed public safety response.  from existing budget resources. And this approach really ensures that fiscal responsibility and demonstrates the city's commitment to addressing the root causes of conflict and crisis without increasing the tax burden on residents and redirecting funds from traditional law enforcement to unarmed public safety response and redirect city resources to supportive social services instead of punitive and harmful law enforcement.  This prevention rather than punishment approach to public safety can reduce the need for more costly interventions later on. The second aspect is establishing a separate number for unarmed response. And having a dedicated number for unarmed response can help streamline services, ensure appropriate response to non-emergency situations.  and alleviate the burden on the 911 system. By establishing a separate number for unarmed response, communities can ensure that mental health crises, substance abuse issues, and other nonviolent situations are addressed with the appropriate level of care and expertise. The last component is excluding police from unarmed response. And by focusing on unarmed response professionals for nonviolent situations, we can  reduce the risk of unnecessary use of force, we can enhance community trust, and encourage more effective community-based solutions. And excluding police from unarmed responses can help minimize the potential for violence or use of force. Unarmed crisis response teams comprised of mental health professionals, social workers, or community mediators, they can often handle situations  without resorting to forceful tactics. So I kind of request that the city council take these findings into consideration and move forward with releasing the RFC for unarmed response.

First, I'd like to give my regards to Bob White and his years of volunteer service. He and I served on the Historic District Commission together for six years.  As someone who's developed in multiple communities and personally rezoned properties and participated in multiple comprehensive plan revision processes and has access to advice from experts in land use law, I offer this. Zoning is law, literally. The zoning code is the codification of the comprehensive plan into enforceable legal language. A rezoning is a change in the law, literally.  So do we really want to instruct the Planning Commission to recommend to change the law for hundreds of parcels to a one-size-fits-all set of rules called TC1, without them being able to recommend to make a new TC2 if good planning would suggest a different set of rules, and without being able to tweak TC1 if it would be problematic planning to apply it as-is to multiple transit corridors, each with different characteristics?  I don't think that is a wise direction, nor do I think it meets the intent of the Michigan Zoning Enabling Act. The Michigan Zoning Enabling Act allows municipalities to have a zoning ordinance if it was based on a plan, a comprehensive plan. They go hand in hand, and the planning comes first. You make the plan, then the zoning language is the legally enforceable language to allow the plan to be executed. Yes, our comprehensive plan mentions the broad concept of transit-oriented zoning multiple times.  So transit-oriented development is consistent with the plan, but the plan lacks sufficient specificity to go straight into encoding. But that's what we're doing. An analogy would be in software development, where if you take high-level design and go straight into coding it, you end up with a mess that has to be reworked.  This proposed resolution presupposes that the Planning Commission may not determine that a new transit corridor zoning category, say TC2, be created if it would better fit the Plymouth and Washtenaw Corridors' unique characteristics. The resolution says that the TC1 set of rules must be applied. And it goes further than that. It says we must rezone hundreds of parcels to TC1 as a priority prior to making any modifications to TC1.  If TC1 doesn't fit the new corridor as well, or if we find other fixes are needed to TC1 as we learn more how applicants with properties in the first two iterations are dealing with it. We are to ignore all of that. And we must rush full steam ahead, rezoning hundreds of parcels to a flawed, one-size-fits-all set of rules. We sure are in a hurry to make amends, just prior to the comprehensive plan revision started, where there will be more public engagement  and a more robust planning process. Thank you.",Housing

I'm here today to express support for the proposed humane pet store ordinance, especially prohibiting the potential future sale of dogs in pet stores. Puppy selling pet stores are a part of a greater pipeline which funnels sick and inhumanely bred puppies into the hands of consumers. The system completely lacks transparency and puppy purchasers don't know what cruelty they are supporting, which is puppy mills.  or commercial breeding facilities with recorded animal welfare violations and hundreds of dogs confined to small cages for the entirety of their lives. Pet stores often sell their puppies for thousands of dollars with false promises of humane, regulated sourcing and healthy, socialized puppies when this is very rarely true.  This ordinance would protect our community members from misleading sales tactics, sick puppy sales, high veterinary bills, and predatory lending that so often occurs when customers can't outright afford a puppy.  The reality is no pet store needs to sell animals in order to be successful. According to Pet Business Magazine, of the top 25 pet retailers in North America, only one sells puppies. And in 2022, that chain shrunk while competitors that didn't sell dogs grew. This is evidence that no pet store needs to sell dogs to be profitable. Pet stores can thrive by providing pet owners with everything they need to care for their pets, rather than selling the pets themselves. And this model is already followed by the vast majority of pet stores here in Michigan.  Six states and over 460 localities have prohibited the sale of dogs and cats in pet stores, including East Point, Fraser, New Baltimore, Royal Oak, Harbor Springs, St. Clair Shores, and newly Woodhaven here in Michigan.  These laws have shrunk demand for puppies bred in cruel conditions with public records showing 32,000 fewer breeding dogs in USDA licensed puppy mills than 10 years ago. I hope Ann Arbor will join in this effort by passing this ordinance and keeping our community humane. Thank you for your time.",Homelessness

Federal law is governing tax exempt obligations like EDC bonds. It's probably one of the, if not the, one of the most complex in the tax code. Arbitrage regulations and so forth. So that it's important that as a project goes forward that everything that can be done is being done to facilitate that process.

But, in fact, I am a cranky old woman who drives cranky old Volvos. One of which is cranky enough and old enough to have a headlight that is consistently out. I went to repair it. It went out again. I gave up at some point. It's been like that for a while. But you know what? I never get stopped. You know why?  First of all, I'm a cranky old lady. Second of all, they are kind of late-ish model Volvos. Third of all, there is a Harvard alumni plate on each of them that I very intentionally put there because my mama didn't raise no fool. I am black. I rarely get stopped.  But let's talk about the numbers because other people aren't so lucky. So the Michigan State Police itself studied itself in 2021. That data revealed that traffic stops conducted in daylight were 18% more likely to have Latinos and 11% more likely to have blacks as the subject of those stops.  A study in a neighboring state found that one-third of the stops for minor traffic offenses were stops of black and Latino drivers. They were stopped twice as often as white drivers and far overrepresented in searches in being handcuffs and in being detained. But the incidence of contraband or evidence was lower than that of white drivers.  So Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Seattle, Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, and Berkeley in California have all implemented policies to limit or eliminate traffic stops for minor violations. And I encourage the city of Ann Arbor to join them.  We can go down a list, you know, there are numbers and then there are names, right? Ty Nichols was pulled over and beaten to death for reckless driving. Daunte Wright was pulled over for an expired registration tag. Rayshard Brooks was shot to death for falling asleep in his car at a Wendy's. Gabriel Navarro was shot 17 times while driving. Sandra Bland killed because an officer said she failed to signal a turn.  And of course, Philando Castile, who, before the police finally killed him in 2016, had been pulled over a staggering 49 times for minor traffic violations. Between 2016 and 21, police killed over 400 drivers or passengers who were unarmed and were not being pursued for a violent crime. And an outside proportion of them, as we know, were black and Latino. And that's an average of one person per week.  Right?

For anyone who doesn't know, I served in law enforcement for many years. So I'll be speaking from that perspective about the traffic stop ordinance. I want to say thank you all that have worked on this, especially Cynthia Harrison, who  I know has put a lot of effort in this. Thank you, Jen Cornell, for co-sponsoring. And this issue is really important for law enforcement in a lot of ways. When I worked as a deputy on patrol in Washtenaw County, I remember pulling somebody over as a new recruit because their exhaust was loud. And in training, that was one of the stops that they told us that we could pull people over for.  I remember going up to the car and I remember seeing how scared they were of me because of this situation. And I asked him, I said, hey, I just pulled you over for your exhaust being loud. And then they went on very quickly to tell me how hard they were trying to fix their car and how they just did not have the money.  I remember walking back to my patrol car and sitting there wondering, why are we pulling people over for this? And then the hard pill to swallow of causing the trauma I did and pulling this person over for this offense. And I think that I now have a social work degree. And I think when we think about traffic enforcement, what we need to realize is it is a traumatic interaction for a lot of people in our community.  For law enforcement, when we pull someone over, that can be a dangerous interaction. And so we should minimize those interactions whenever possible. We should make them for safety reasons, but we should not be making them because of a registration sticker that got put in the wrong spot, or an air freshener, or a crack in the windshield. These things really hurt the trust that we are trying to build in communities.  And so the more that we can do ordinances like this I think are a step in the right direction to start reducing the unnecessary contact that doesn't really need to take place if it's not a safety risk or a safety hazard. I think that this will also help protect younger officers so they won't have to go through that situation I did on patrol and have to live with that trauma knowing that I caused harm.  And so the more that we can start restructuring our laws and our ordinances and what we have law enforcement do, the better we can actually have a community where people are not being harmed, not being killed, and not being injured because of our practices. And so I just want to thank you all for your work. I especially want to thank Cynthia Harrison. I know that you put a lot of work into this. And thank everyone here today for listening and hearing us out. So thank you.",Public Safety and Law Enforcement

But their intentions here for this plaza redevelopment are clear. The resource is at the ready, and we should catch that wave and ensure that we get the best possible outcome for the city and its residents.  Specifically, I want to support the intent to use all of the adjacent right-of-way on Liberty Street for inclusion in this plaza. Unlike some more challenging public sites downtown, this site has the ingredients for successful and vibrant public plaza space. It has active uses facing multiple sides. It has terra firma for sustaining trees and other vegetation. It is open and transparent to the surrounding streets.  There will be logistical trade-offs and complications for the adjacent parcels and for those traveling through downtown, but those are small costs relative to the potential benefits this kind of space will bring. While I'm here, I also want to support passing CT2 to limit pretextual stops by the police and encourage your ongoing support for creating and funding an unarmed response program by passing DC6.  Whenever we use armed police to respond to community needs, we inevitably risk that resolution will come at the end of the barrel of a gun or other violent force. And it is marginalized people, as we've heard tonight, multiple stripes that suffer an unequal burden, and this is an avoidable outcome. So thank you for all of your work on this.  And lastly, I also support the passage of C1 at first reading tonight. We're in a housing crisis. We need more housing of all kinds. It's a high demand area to live. It's a site that sat vacant for far too long. The developer's plan comports with the zoning ordinance that applies to the site. There's no reason not to say no. There's no reason to say no to 200 additional homes, especially since it's coming with almost no parking. So thank you.",Urban Development

I'm the Reverend Donnell White and I live in the 500 block of Silo Church Road in the 4th Ward. I'm calling in to speak in support of the Driving Equity Ordinance C2. The majority of policing and police interactions with civilians nationwide occur during traffic stops. These are often civil infractions. But racial inequity is endemic in our criminal justice system.  And one key driver of those inequities is the so-called pretext or pretextual stop. These stops are made by police officers as a result of an observed traffic or ordinance infraction.  but they are really about an officer wanting to uncover evidence or to conduct a search. The data shows that black motorists are significantly more likely to be subjected to pretextual stops than white people, and pretextual stops are heavily associated with racial profiling.  As you know, your own Independent Police Oversight Committee noted during their update to Council on June 5th that this data isn't just coming from out there, nationwide. It's actually right here in Ann Arbor. According to the research conducted by the SMART Center at EMU,  that evaluated AAPD stop data from 2017 to 2019, it found significant disparities across every dimension examined. Black motorists are being stopped and searched in Ann Arbor more frequently than white residents. It makes it unsafe for me, a black resident, who is male, to drive in our city.  Now, what I've noted is you cannot train away racial bias. You actually have to change the underlying systems that allow racial bias to harm people like myself and other residents.  Anything else is a policy decision. It's a policy decision to support the ongoing racial bias that's embedded in our existing system. So I am incredibly grateful to Councilmember Harrison for taking on this important issue to ensure that I can move about the city freely. In addition, I want to offer my support for DC6, and I'm grateful that Unarmed Public Safety is moving forward in Ann Arbor.  I was heartbroken when I heard about Scott Fitzpatrick's experience when he called for a mental health wellness check, but instead watched his wife get arrested. They then incurred over $10,000 in fees and fines, and they have to live with the trauma of that experience for the rest of their lives.  This was a categorical failure of our community to care for each other. And so I'm grateful that the PSC Community Engagement Report affirms with the coalition re-envisioning our safety has already proposed over a year ago that public unarmed safety should be...

I tell you, the only difference between them is the dates, the time. The only difference.  This is a practice that goes back to slave catchers or to slave patrol. That's the only difference between what we address in the day and those issues. There shouldn't be a single person on this council that don't support that resolution. Not a single person. There shouldn't be a single conversation that's in opposition to this. Period.  Period. There is no difference than what happens on the West Bank when a mother or a father or a son or a daughter or a grandparent in their own country have to have a work pass to go past a certain point. There's no difference from what went on in South Africa before their racial reconciliation with apartheid.

I'd like to talk to you tonight about two items on your agenda, DC2 and C2. First, I'd like to talk about C2, the Driving Equality Ordinance. I am delighted to see this on the agenda tonight, and I hope to see it passed into the second reading unanimously and without being watered down. Thank you to Councilmember Harrison for bringing this forward, and for those of you who have already signed on as co-sponsors.  As we have seen in many cases around the country, interactions with police can be dangerous, particularly for people of color. We are not immune to that here, and we have seen the data showing that even we have disparities in how often people are pulled over and the outcomes of those stops.  This ordinance change will reduce these interactions with police, eliminating many that are, frankly, unnecessary anyway. Traffic enforcement can and should be limited to driving behaviors that are actually relevant to traffic safety, speeding, running red lights, road rage, failing to yield to pedestrians, and so on.  I hope the Driving Equality Ordinance will be uncontroversial among Councilmembers, as some other important ordinance changes have been, and I would love to see everyone jump on board to co-sponsor this tonight and at second reading. I would also like to mention that I am glad to see us continue to move forward with the RFP for an unarmed response program. I am following this with a lot of hope for what we can accomplish here in Ann Arbor with this and other reforms like the Driving Equality Ordinance.  I would also like to support DC2, the federal building plaza on Liberty Street. From my reading of this, it appears that the feds are going to be moving forward with redeveloping this plaza, whatever council has to say about it. I think it's great that we might be able to influence what these changes look like, and I like the ideas presented in the resolution. Pedestrianized streets are great, and I really enjoy our summer open streets over on Main Street.  If we can get a pedestrianized block of liberty out of the deal, it would certainly make that block more pleasant to visit. And what better place to put it than on the same block as the Blake Transit Center near the William and Division Bikeways? While I rarely bother to bring my car with me when I visit downtown, I know many people do. So the fact that it is only a block or so away from three large parking garages should alleviate that concern. Please also pass DC2 tonight. Thank you.",Public Safety and Law Enforcement

I'm Dr. Lisa Jackson, the former chair of Ann Arbor's Independent Community Police Oversight Commission. For years, I advocated for transparency and accountability in policing in Ann Arbor. I'm here today in support of the Driving Equity Ordinance sponsored by Councilmember Cynthia Harrison and others. I've been stopped for not taking my handicapped placard down soon enough after leaving a grocery store when my daughter was in a wheelchair. I've had colleagues who've been stopped for having a child's graduation tassel hanging with pride from their rearview mirror.  I don't believe that the police or anyone feel that either of these were a threat to public safety. I perceive them, however, to be a pretext by which to stop and interrogate people who look like me. When I discussed these issues with Chief Cox, and specifically the claim that some people are concerned about that tinted windows make police less safe, he reminded me that in Florida, Arizona, Nevada, and California, tinted windows are in regular use and they have not posed a threat to police.  maybe we can do an exchange program and send some AAPD to these summer climbs. I saw Amy here, so maybe we can do like a trade-off thing. After much advocacy and my working for over 14 months, as you guys know, to get accurate traffic stop data from AAPD, the Southeast Michigan Criminal Justice Policy Research Project, called SMART, has finalized a report of traffic stops in Ann Arbor from 2017 to 2019.  Data on 2020, which is the first COVID year, are being analyzed separately. I worked very hard, as you know, upstream on this issue because traffic stops are the number one way in which people come in contact with the police. Just as Michigan State Police found when they had researchers at Michigan State analyze their data, the SMART team at Eastern has found significant disparities in the way drivers are policed in Ann Arbor at every single dimension examined.  Non-white motorists are stopped and searched more frequently than white motorists. The largest disparities should surprise no one. African-American male drivers were stopped for equipment violations, such as a hanging tassel, over 200% more than would be expected by the data, and they were searched after such stops between 365% and 500% more than would be expected by the data.  Middle Eastern male drivers were stopped 81% more often, while white female drivers were stopped less than should be expected by the data. There are certainly other statistically significant findings. Overall, the antiquated processes by which police are allowed to stop motorists do not keep us safer.  Allowing, supporting, and turning a blind eye to police with the discretion to search people who look like me, Lisa Jackson, while letting people who look like Lisa Dish off with a warning, or more significantly, not stopping her in the first place, do not keep us safer. The city of Ann Arbor needs to live up to its progressive image and join Philadelphia, Los Angeles, and other cities who have relied on data to bring their cities into the 21st century and to decrease the disparities with which people come into contact with police by way of traffic stops.

I am the current chair of the Independent Police Oversight Commission. A few years ago,  Our son was a student at Pioneer High School. He played on the basketball team. One Friday evening, as was our custom, his father and I went to the basketball game. We sat there and watched him play. After the game, we all got up and we left together. In the parking lot, we stopped and spoke with some other parents. Our son got into his old raggedy car and started home ahead of us down stadium.  Within 10 minutes or so, we also proceeded down stadium on our way home. When traffic light, I'm sorry, lights of a police car drew our attention, we looked over. Now this was a cold, dark night. And we looked over to see our son's car and our son with his coat unzipped and hands up like this standing on the sidewalk.  We walked over, we parked and walked over. At that time, by the way, I was working for the city of Ann Arbor in the city attorney's office. No, I take, yeah, or was I in the prosecutor's office? One or the other. In any case, I walked over, I said, what's going on? They said, who are you? I said, we're his parents. They said, we stopped him because he fits the description of someone who just robbed a store over on Broadway.  I said, what was the description? Young black man with a knit cap on. Did I tell you it was cold out? We said, we just left him at Pioneer High School. The officer looked at me and said, well, when we pulled him over, we smelled marijuana.  I'm not one to believe my children never did anything wrong. I went to the car. I said, you didn't smell marijuana. The officer says, oh, you're going to tell me my job? I said, yeah, I was trying marijuana cases when you were in high school. I almost said that. But I held back. Then they said,  Well, we found a weapon in the car. Weapon in the car? My son, because of the age of his car, had a rock. He would start the car up in the morning and it would cut off if he just left it. So he'd start up, put the rock on the gas pedal, and go inside to finish getting ready for school. Absolute everything wrong, not true. This is what happens.  It didn't matter to the police that night that my son, our son, was a National Honor Society two-time letter winner, an all-around good guy. That evening, he was a black man with a knit cap on.

I'm here to speak deeply in favor of the proposal to stop executing traffic violations, stops by police in the city, the Pre-Tax stops. Decades of research have shown that traffic stops have an extremely disproportionate impact on black and brown and poor drivers, while white people driving fancy cars are subjected to an entirely different reality.  In some cases, like we have read about in Ferguson, Missouri, this leads to an outright cycle of terror for young, often poor, black men. We must soberly recognize that while Ann Arbor is not Ferguson, Ann Arbor is not not Ferguson, either. In fact, a recent report from the Citizens for Racial Equity in Washtenaw County, the crew report is damning, and I quote, the breadth of the racial disparities crew documented and the impact in terms of punishment on people of color are so stark  that CREW presents this report to our community with a call for immediate action by those institutions responsible for funding, administering, and overseeing the criminal legal system in Washtenaw County. The report found that in the county, prosecutors charge POC dramatically more than white people and that POC get worse treatment in the court system. The blatant reality is that the more contact that black people have with police, the more this racial disparity and punishment will widen.  And although that sounds bad, these are in fact life-ruining sentences, and the ramifications of these decisions are extremely serious. Nothing would be a racist and evil thing to do in this case. I'm looking forward to seeing how crows will begin to peel back the layers of policing in this county, finding, I hope, more and more instances in which the harsh punishment of imprisonment, as well as more minor retributions, are increasingly unnecessary. While we're at it, I would love to see Ann Arbor use its significant power in the county to encourage all municipalities to stop pretext stops  And I deeply encourage you to open a line of communication with the county prosecutor's office as well. The prosecutor's website states that they will, quote, no longer prosecute contraband cases that arise in pretext stops. Specifically, the prosecutor's office will no longer prosecute possession of contraband crimes that arise from a factual scenario, indicating that a police officer stopped a person for a minor infraction, but where their real goal was to uncover evidence that a civilian possessed drugs or other contraband. Unfortunately, the current reality is that the SABOT office is still prosecuting pretext stops,  It's their opinion that this policy stated on their own website only applies in scenarios in which the stop individual goes on specifically to give consent to the stopping officer to search their vehicle. This further specification of that policy renders it utterly unaware of the scope of this problem. Let us all be clear in our demand from the prosecutor to execute the pretext policy as stated. Stop prosecuting contraband from pretext stops immediately. And while I'm here, I'd quickly like to mention that if I were an Ann Arbor City Council member,  I'm just starting to worry about the city's biggest landlord and client, the University of Michigan, being under investigation by its accreditor for faking thousands of grades. You all might want to check on that and encourage them to make some confessions to GEO. Thank you all very much.",Police Reform

All right, so my very first interaction with police in my life, I was 12 years old, right here by University of Michigan Police Department by what was the Freeze Building. It's now North Quad, so I'm giving away my age here.  So I'm the embodiment of disparate traffic stops right here in Washtenaw County. My current case is being tracked by MLive and other local media outlets. Long story short, I was pulled over in Ypsilanti for failure to signal in a residential neighborhood and subsequently arrested for contraband.  I have never in my adult life committed a violent act, yet Ellie Savitt and Washtenaw County Police treat me as like a terrorist. I wonder why.  On the issue of police discretion in traffic stops, fact is discretion is not given to poor black people. Politicians the world over run these compassion campaigns, yet study after study, year after year, reveals ongoing patterns of anti-black, anti-poor, and anti-labor policing. NPR just revealed a Michigan State police study, once again affirming widespread and systemic disparities when dealing with black motorists in particular. But this is not news.  So how can poor, black, underrepresented constituents feel confident this will be any different? How are police and policy makers being held accountable aside from distractive identity politics to remind us, hey, at least we're not Trump? What is going to be gained from this discussion aside from thoughts and prayers?  There is the crew report, the Michigan State Police report, a mountain of scholarly academic literature in a valley of the mostly ignored and neglected experiences of millions of poor and black folks. This is both academic and simple. Black folks are adversely affected by discretionary policing, especially traffic stops. We even have a candidate for sheriff, a former beat cop who centered part of her campaign around eliminating quotas based on her personal experience as a cop.  Speaking engagements are great for PR, but what can voters actually expect? And to whom do they voice their opinions to since racist policing has been endemic for generations? In the words of Judge Arian Slay here in Washtenaw County, Washtenaw County prides itself on thinking left, but actually it looks right.  The idea that police need to do more to keep us safe is a force-fed idea, mostly by the Democrats. After all, the mood of the constituents at the time of their election in 2020 was to defund the police. How and when did the electorate suddenly change its mind on this issue? Or was this the decision of embedded elites who just cannot and will not fathom the terrifying prospect of the world changing before them? Of the political and fight... Am I done?  Thank you. Of the political and financial connections with the prison industrial complex and its irresistible and exhaustible golden honeypot. Thank you.

I served for three years as chair of the Ann Arbor Transportation Commission, and I still sit on the commission, but I'm speaking tonight only for myself. I'm calling in support of C2, the driving equality ordinance. As an advocate for road safety and a transportation system that serves everyone, I'm strongly in favor of policies that reduce interactions with the police on our roads. I realize that might seem incongruous,  but consider that the American Public Health Association has declared police violence to be a public health crisis. There is extensive evidence that police and policing cause harm to black, immigrant, indigenous, queer people and other people of color, as does involvement in the criminal legal system. If we want our roads to be safe for everyone, that means we have to consider not only safety from traffic violence, but also safety from state violence.  Secondary traffic stops for things like a broken taillight, tinted windows, and loud exhaust do not make our roads safer. But tonight, we've heard a lot about the extensive evidence that they do disproportionately harm people of color. And we've also heard personal testimony about our Black neighbors' experiences with excessive traffic stops in Ann Arbor. Ending this practice will move us a step closer to the safe, equitable, and just transportation system Ann Arbor aspires to.  While I'm here, I also want to express support for DC6, the resolution in support of an RFP issuance for the unarmed response program. This resolution recognizes the importance of creating an unarmed response program that is run independently by a third party. This is a structure that is widely supported by both established best practices in these programs around the country and by members of our local community.

Let me relate a short story. I am Nancy Margolis, founder of Embracing Our Differences Michigan. We exhibit those huge banners in Gallup Park to promote discussions  and pride in diversity. One banner last year stimulated many discussions. A beautiful, gorgeous work by an Ann Arbor artist and dentist, Dr. James Lee, showed a young African-American boy jogging and driving. He entitled his work, Lift Up Your Voice and Scream.  On tours of the exhibit, so many black and brown mothers viewed this painting and shared with me how terrified they are each time their sons go out running or driving, how an innocent normal action can be misunderstood and can escalate. I urge you to pass Chapter 124 so that our mothers can feel safe for their sons.",Police Reform

I had planned to call in earlier about C2, but it has already been passed. I still want to state things that I was going to say because the police are not here to help us. Broken window policies only exist so that the state can harass those that they deem less than themselves. Historically, these people have been in the black and brown communities. Cars having wear or tear or any kind of aging  is not enough reason for the police to intervene in someone's life and find an excuse for further subjugation. I absolutely applaud this amendment for being approved because this means that the police can no longer use these existing policies to harm and take life as they did with Philando Castile. Secondly, the wonderful people who do pull over preventions can now spend that time helping their communities in other ways instead of helping the police avoid  instead of helping these people avoid the police like Sauron's eye. Has anyone ever called the cops and honestly thought they would help you find out who broke into your car? Insurance claims maybe, but not to actually solve the crime. So what makes you think that when they pull over and harass people, they say are criminals, that they're actually not just looking for an excuse to look busy? I will leave you with wisdom from words past.  Fuck the police coming straight from the underground. A young nigga got it bad to them brown, and not the other kind, so police think they have the authority to kill a minority. Have a nice night.",Police Reform

I am happy that this ordinance did pass on tonight.  It is my prayer that no kinks pop up in his past in the second reading. And I, it is my prayer because in Washtenaw County, there is this claim to being so progressive. And a lot of times it turns into symbolism. And so it is my hope that this has the weight needed to enforce when officers will still try to do pretext stops on black and brown folks  As we see, Washtenaw County prosecutor on day one said no pretext stops in Washtenaw County, and that any contraband found would be thrown out. That has not happened. We have got calls from multiple families that are suffering because they're poor, because they had a life that was out. This is still happening with a law on the books that says no pretext stops.  So it is my hope that while I'm grateful this has been passed, that we have the meat needed to hold officers accountable when they do this. And that all pretext stops that have contraband or anything found are really thrown out. This is an assault against the black community. I can't even tell you as a black woman, I'm scared when I'm pulled over by the police. They come up to you with their hands on their guns. I have been treated horribly by the Ann Arbor police just  When the Black Lives Matter mural in Willard Park was destroyed and had this man totally act as if I wasn't there, as if I was invisible and treated me very horribly. This is the state of policing in America, but not just in America, right here in Ann Arbor. Number eight, elitist city, right? So we're asking that please don't just make this symbolism, but give it the meat needed to hold your officers accountable to actually follow this ordinance so that black and brown lives  can be safe in the Ann Arbor area. Thank you. And lastly, thank you to Councilwoman Harrison for all of her work on this. It is my hope that, you know, she gets more support and some of the things that she brings forward in the future. Thank you, Councilwoman Harrison and everyone else that supported.",Police Reform

So it seems like you're just overflowing with comments for me tonight. Just really happy with the way that council has voted tonight. So thank you all so very much. I just wanted to say as someone who is particularly interested in historic architecture, I found the  historic district awards earlier tonight a little bit weird, because those buildings didn't really seem to match a reasonable definition of historic to me. Old? Yeah, sure, some of them are. Pretty and well-maintained? Mostly, yes. But being old and pretty doesn't  it isn't enough to make something historic. And I really do wish our historic district commission would spend more time preserving actual history than trying to freeze a few buildings in time when they have roughly the same historical value as my own 1960s ranch style house.  I was also a little bit disappointed to hear that the bicycle lanes on Stadium are going to be shut down entirely for the helicopter-based installation of new lights. It's quite concerning because it seems to treat people who commute by bicycle as second-class citizens over people who  commute by automobile. To the extent that this closes down one of the very few decent bike throughways in the city so as not to reduce the capacity for cars and chooses to endanger people on bicycle  in order to not minorly inconvenience people in cars. Given all of the talk about equity tonight, I would like to raise this as being something that is equitable and quite unacceptable. Thank you.",Urban Development

Hello, my name is Rita Ross.  and I represent Earhart Village Homes Association this evening as its president. Myself and many members of our association have attended all the community meetings regarding the Earhart Road 2023 project since 2019. I have spoken and written to you about this project now for over a year. We have wanted to see production and resurfacing for many years.  Our goal was to eliminate the sidewalk gap project because it would not serve its desired purpose and still won't because significant gaps remain in front of Boxford Cemetery and between the Pine Tree Street with no plans to fill those gaps. Also, because it would infringe upon and significantly harm our property and likely seriously damage our mature trees and paintings and plantings.  We were very disappointed that it took numerous attempts to be heard by the city. We attended meetings, we made public comments, we wrote letters, but there was no response from our representative government. Our own Ward 2 council members were told not to speak with us. It was not until we hired an attorney to force a response and provide a signed petition  that we finally received some response. We should not have had to pay thousands of dollars to force a representative government to respond and to work with us. Ultimately, Nick Hutchinson and Nick Bailey did meet and collaborate with us. They listened to our concerns especially and seriously. They investigated our suggestions to move the project west or closer to the median, which may waste the sidewalk to be closer to the existing growth.  They changed the retaining wall design and configuration to limit the damage to our property, and agreed to replace, like for like, evergreen for evergreen, for any tree that needed to be removed to accommodate their design. We do still have concerns about potential traffic issues during the construction phase.  But we would like this evening to thank Nick Bailey and Nick Hutchinson for their collaboration, and we look forward to our continuing project partnership during the construction and reforestation phase of the project.

I'm here again because I am going to run a campaign and replace this lady, Jen Eyre, who is racist and she has accepted money from friends of Israel Defense Forces. Israel Defense Forces are a terrorist organization that murder children, elderly, anyone they can get their hands on.  Israel has done everything, everything under the sun. Murdered toddlers, killed reporters, uprooted people from their homes. And the United States pays for these atrocities by spending billions of dollars each year from our taxes.  We've been asking for 20 years that this body of people discuss we are against military aid to Israel. They never have. I don't know what else Israel has to do for this bunch of white people to decide it is enough.  A two-year-old was killed on the same day that Ms. Song here and Mr. Watson here were crying over how much they love Israel and their friends and this and that. At the same time that Israel had murdered a two-year-old, they were saying stuff to bring us images of people in concentration camps.

While I'm glad to see that these parcels will be zoned R1D instead of the  ridiculous R1A district that essentially acts as a filter to allow only the ultra wealthy to live in an area. The fact that as a city we're still preventing people from building duplexes on their own property really saddens me. It's an indicator that, as a city, we still aren't taking seriously the goal of allowing anyone, not just the wealthy, to live here. I'm sure the move would be unpopular with our local landlords,  But most of us who live in the present and don't have a vested interest in exacerbating the housing crisis would support you in making it possible for all residential zones to have duplexes on them. Speaking of things that local landlords are likely to oppose, I'm excited to see CA9 come back onto the agenda in August.  I hope that when it does, it doesn't do what is effectively removing $6.2 million from the Affordable Housing Fund, as that seems like a bit of a negative side effect of this.

I'm here on behalf of the NLG and the lawyers and legal workers throughout the state who make up our membership to express our outrage concerning the conduct of the Ann Arbor Police Department. Last Wednesday, July 12th, the volunteers of FedUp Ministries were, as they do each week, feeding our community from their free food truck at Liberty Plaza.  Officers from the AAPD used this occasion to arrest a citizen for a minor crime that was alleged to have occurred in another place and on another day. Their protestations to the contrary notwithstanding, this is not the first time the AAPD has carried out arrests at locations set up to serve the hungry and unhoused. We urge this council to take concrete steps to ensure that this is the last. No one should ever have to choose between food and their freedom.  Prosecuting petty theft cannot and must not be held as more important than the basic human right to sustenance. The good people at FedUp Ministries are an important part of the safety net that supports the most marginalized and underserved in our community. Using their work as bait for law enforcement undermines their ability to continue to serve our citizens and is frankly grotesque.  Where are our priorities? What do we value as a community? Are alleged violations of property rights truly more important than the human rights of our most valuable residents, our most vulnerable residents? It shows an utter lack of vision for this city to place law enforcement above all else. In what way was anyone truly protected or served by the Ann Arbor police last Wednesday? In what way did any of us benefit by making it more dangerous to feed or be fed in Ann Arbor?  Finally, let me point out that if we, society at large, citizens of Washtenaw County, or specifically this council, were meeting our obligations to all of our citizens, fed-up ministries would not need to be feeding our neighbors at Liberty Plaza each Wednesday. No one would be resorting to petty theft to survive. And the Ann Arbor police, regardless of their priorities, would have had no one to arrest last week. The police can do better.  This council can do better, both in supervising the police and in serving everyone in our community. And our community can do better.

Say hello to the Huron River Water Trail. You are invited to keep the river healthy and beautiful. As people are getting outside in record numbers, the need to put leave-no-trace skills and ethics into action is more imperative than ever. I quote there from the permanent leave-no-trace plaque installed adjacent to the Argo Livery office.  Yesterday, the New York Times had an op-ed about the growing importance of  River recreation in our time of global warming, it focused on Munich's Isar River as green infrastructure, serving the needs and desires of thousands of urban residents. Ann Arbor's Huron River could have been included, a site of exponential growth of human activity, the centerpiece being the Cascades.  I love the cascades, the sound of falling water, the lovely walkway on the berm, the grasses on the banks. Sunday early, I watched expert kayakers practicing maneuvers. Recently, I encountered a young woman reading a book at the foot of the cascades amid dozens of tubers.  The city should be proud of the Cascades' amenity in 19- in 2012, converting a murky head race into an intended kayak and canoe playground as part of a costly project to save Argo Dam and Pond. I appreciate this. But the Cascades' plan failed in significant ways.  Three cascades that were planned became nine. Canoeing was considered hazardous, and canoers were redirected to an alternate portage. Not foreseen, tubing became number one. And ever-growing numbers were bringing their own inflatables, bypassing the livery office. So many people from a wide region seeking a blast at a very small site.  Overwhelming the Cascades neighborhood with traffic, parking issues, litter and drinking. Early on, neighbors began speaking up.  In 2012, police stepped up patrols to deal with the Cascades chaos. Parking restrictions were introduced, and council members seemed to be listening, even joining in with us to collect trash. Nevertheless, the issues of the Cascades traffic have grown year by year. I have two questions. Can the city bring a comprehensive approach to the protection of our neighborhood's security and well-being?

The reason I wanted to come here tonight is to speak about the reparation initiative that the city council is getting ready to, I guess, initiate. I think that before you initiate a reparation committee, you should meet with some of the people that used to live here, that has been moved out of this community. You should listen to some of the pain and anger that they have regarding how they've been gentrified out of the community.  There are people that are born here that cannot afford to live here. You know, those are the kinds of things that I think when you're looking at reparation, you should include that in the conversation, because that's one of the reasons why we need that. For example, you know, we look at City Hall and the employment ratio here.  There's very few black employees here. If you go out on these construction sites, you don't see any black men. The kind of job that we used to do, the hard stuff, you don't see that anymore because they're good paying jobs. So people that really could benefit from that are not being able to benefit. So I think those are the kinds of things that you should look at when you talk about establishing a recreation task force. Because those are the kinds of things that you need to take into consideration. Because just to create an initiative, just  initiative is not something that is valuable. I would also like to speak to the issue. I think I read in the paper about a month, a month and a half ago, where there was a presentation made by the city administrator to build housing, I guess, attached to the city hall. And I think the statement was that there would be no low-income housing, affordable housing.  And I find that to be contradictory to what the city is about. The city should be looking at taking care of those, especially if we're going to be using city property to build housing. People that can't afford housing otherwise should be given an opportunity to live in the structure. After all, this is the people's house. We pay their taxes. We support this. So I think that to say that these units, whenever they are bound to come about,  would not be open to people with low income. I don't think that's morally right. And I would like to congratulate Sister Cynthia Harrison for being a part of this initiative. I knew her mother, I knew her father, I knew her family, and they would be proud of you for taking the initiative that you're taking. Thank you.",Housing

I signed up to speak on CA9. I would like to thank council members for not only just pulling this from the consent agenda, but pulling it from the agenda in its entirety. I'd ask that you focus on meeting the expectations of the people. We did pass an affordable housing millage.  And we do have certain expectations, and one of those was the development of affordable housing on that site, at the old Y lot. It was identified that that's just an ideal location for affordable housing, right downtown, right next to the Blake Transit Center. And if you recall, there was talk about not even putting any affordable housing units there, and just having a payment loop for non-affordable housing development. That gladly, fortunately, went by the wayside,  And we had an approval for a building that would have a minimum number of affordable housing units. I forget the exact number, but a couple of towers and one would be all affordable housing. But we also approved the possibility of that building going up as high as 275 feet. It should be about 50% more than people's expectations going into that. So again, as we review this whole project and where the money's going, where it's coming from,  Please think about what the people's expectations were when we passed an affordable housing billage and when we supported development or analysis of the city-owned sites for affordable housing. One of those sites was also 415 West Washington. That one's a bit of a shell game. What's going on there is a, I've spoken about it before, but we're gonna, the way it's designed right now, we're gonna have zero dollars for affordable housing on that site. And it's a bit of a bait and twitch over there.  Nice luxury units, but no affordable housing money whatsoever. I would like to thank certain private developers who are doing the right thing in terms of providing affordable housing, providing sustainable building techniques. I want to call out the developer of the PUD at North Maple. I think it's a shining example. They've been lauding it since they first came to the pre-PUD meeting, to the planning commission, of somebody who studied what the city wants  study what the people of the city want, and deliver it on affordable housing and sustainability from the outset, not being dragged tooth and nail, not having to negotiate. They led the right type of development. And I want to ask us, what kind of message do we send when we applaud a developer like that? But then what's on the agenda tonight later on? We'll talk about the details later.  We're the exact opposite.

I'm here to go over what has happened in the past couple of weeks. The last city council meeting, we, the people, managed to put the issue of reparations to black America on the table. These people here and their buddies before them, no one ever did that.  The people of this town put the issue of reparations on the agenda, on the discussion table a couple of weeks ago. And there is an article in the Ann Arbor News. You can go look it up and you can see how all these people are bellyaching about, oh, yeah, how they really want to do it. If they wanted to do it, they would have done it.  Like Blaine said, in the 1800s, black people were asking for reparations. They were saying, give us a mule and 40 acres and we would sustain ourselves. Did they give it to them? No. These people have no intentions of giving anything to blacks or red people or native people or anything, as much as they say they might, and they don't say it much, but anyway, they have no intention. We have to kick their ass into actually doing it.  So I want to ask everyone in Ann Arbor to come here, speak for reparations, and let's push and force these people to do it.  Again, as Blaine said, and as you can see from everyone who speaks here, the population in this town is not happy with the record that this bunch has. This bunch gets pushed into their places by the donations they accept from the ultra wealthy in this town. They take over the seats and they vote all of them.  with Mr. Mayor here, who is the man for, you know, deciding what goes and what doesn't go. So we want a representative city government. This is not representing the people. As you can see, after 20 years of just talking about  affordable housing. We do not have affordable housing, but we have a whole lot of luxury housing that nobody can afford, $800,000 minimum level of houses you can buy in Ann Arbor. That is a shame. That tells you clearly that this city council does not care about  Regular people, it cares about the rich. This city council doesn't care about blacks, but we have to force them to care. If they did care, do you think the university would be accepting 4% black enrollment? No, they would have been bringing it up to 10%, which is what they promised 50 years ago.  Any of these guys ever pushed the university to do it? No, they haven't. Look at the Ann Arbor now. Lefebvre said it. Many, many communities of black have been pushed out of this town because of these guys. So do not be fooled by them when they tell you, yeah, we will have committees, we will talk about reparations. No, they will not.  They will make sure that it gets grind down to the floor. So come here, speak for reparation, speak for Palestinians who are fighting, struggling against human rights abuses of Israel.",Israel-Palestine

At the last city council meeting, we heard from council member Chris Watson about how he is rightfully afraid of the police. He is rightfully afraid of the police. So you might guess that Watson would identify with Palestinians who are rightfully afraid of being kidnapped and killed by the Israeli military, not just pulled over.  But no, unless Watson is the one, and he cannot even make eye contact. There we go, eye contact. But no, unless Watson is the one getting pulled over and killed himself, he simply doesn't care who Israel kills with his money. Doesn't care at all, far as I can tell. Correct me if I'm wrong.  Israel was almost founded in Uganda in 1905, except the white settlers stopped the whole plan. So instead of massacring Africans, Israel went over and established itself in Palestine to massacre Palestinians. It could have been Africans.  Israel tried to give nuclear weapons, the atomic bomb, to apartheid South Africa to kill black people, Chris. To kill black people, Chris. But Councilmember Watson is too busy to care. Too busy crying like a baby over the sufferings of the European Holocaust, which ended in 1945. What a pitiful sissy. What a pitiful sissy.  He knows what white supremacist state violence is. He knows, but don't ask him for a Palestinian human rights resolution, or he's liable, oh, there goes Iyer, running away from the room. We're gonna talk about you in a minute. Don't ask him for a Palestinian human rights resolution, or else he'll get down on his knees and cry over the tragedy of white Europeans.  Over white Europeans. But white Europeans are not afraid of the police today. They don't need your tears, Chris. Palestinians need you. Do you think it's right, Chris, for Palestinians to pay for the Holocaust? Palestinians? Who gave you that sick idea?  Pitiful as Councilmember Watson is, Jen Eyre sitting there is worse. Eyre took campaign money from old friends of the Israel Defense Forces, and you know the IDF is just like the Ku Klux Klan, except you're paying them $3.8 billion every year.  And look, Ayer is now sinking the whole reparations boat for black people, trying to pit black and native people against each other and put them at each other's throats for reparations money.

I'm glad that CA9 has been pulled from the agenda for further consideration. I'll keep my comments brief and maybe back in August once I see what the next iteration will look like.  As a part of Council of 2018 through 2022, I co-sponsored the millage for affordable housing. I also co-sponsored the resolutions to transfer the city-owned property to the Housing Commission for a nominal fee of, I think, $1 to build affordable housing. As we all know, this site has a long history of affordable housing. Affordable housing was there before  Things were torn down and left vacant So it was alarming for me to see that council had thought of essentially reneging on prior commitments While on council I was reminded that promises made our promises kept There was the 40 40 20 resolution which I tried unsuccessfully to overturn I  yet it was vetoed and promises were made and promises were kept. When the millage was passed, we all knew it was not enough money. We were gonna need hundreds of millions of dollars to address affordable housing, not just 120 or 150 million. It was just one tool at our disposal, a big tool to transfer city-owned property to the Housing Commission to build affordable housing.  In 2017 and 2018, we heard the value of leveraging dollars so that we can use housing tax credits to leverage 5 million for it to become 50 million. I am just here today urging this council to reconsider this thought, which I believe is a financial shell game. It is to free up $5 million from the general fund  to then spend on other initiatives and projects. Many of you campaigned, most of you, if not all, some were uncontested. But when you're out there, you hear from folks, affordable housing is the number one issue. And since COVID, it's even become more acute of an issue.  I urge this council to honor past resolutions and transfer this property for next to nothing to the Housing Commission. Do not go ahead with taking $5 million from the Ann Arbor Housing Commission. Thank you.",Housing

Yes, my name is Justin Yuan, and I've been a McKinney property tenant for three years. I am calling in on the issue of non-refundable fees and tenant applications. Even as they raise their rent year after year, landlords charge fees for applying to wait lists, to applying to rental properties, and everything in between. They want to make money, not just on the people who are having to sign leases, but everyone who's even looking for housing in the area, right? Something that we all need in this age of human rights.  Even when these fees are ostensibly refundable, it's extremely difficult and nigh impossible to actually get refunded. I urge City Council to eliminate non-refundable fees and heavily restrict even refundable fees in order to remove the burden from tenants who can't bear this cause as much as a landlord who might lose out on 50 bucks. This is a necessary step in addressing the larger issue at hand of landlord greed and overreach.  The result of recent reforms, like the early leasing ordinance and right to renew, show that landlords themselves, whether they're huge corporate monstrosities like McKinley or even so-called office-top landlords, can't be trusted to obey these things on their own. They can't be trusted to follow new reforms that get passed and can't be trusted to follow standards, regulations, and guidelines that already exist.  We need to fully fund the departments, offices, and relevant mechanisms to enforce everything that we have on the board already and go further in strengthening that infrastructure and building up the capacity to fully hold landlords to account and make sure that we have housing that we can live in, that we can not just live in and keep the rain on us, but live dignified lives, where we don't have to deal with mold, respiratory issues. We don't have to deal with structural issues that put our compartments away.  where we can live like human beings. I highly urge city council to take tenants' rights seriously. In my day job, I'm a union organizer. And we all know, as many of you do on city council, that workers are on the back foot. But when I started doing this housing stuff, when I started having housing issues of my own, I found that tenants, the rights for tenants and the fight that we have makes the fight that we're waging on the worker organizing side seem like a cakewalk.  It's absolutely brutal, and we have little to no recourse on a wide, wide range of issues. No, we're all workers, whether we're in the workplace or out of the workplace. And I know many of you on this council make a big deal out of your co-worker credentials. I highly urge you to take this seriously, and realize you can't be a pro-worker while also neglecting the crisis and taking these things like they're not serious. Thank you.",Housing

I think it's great that it's there.  But if you're heading west on Catherine and making a left-hand turn, heading south on 5th Ave, I've noticed some real close calls with a couple people riding down, because you're kind of coming down a hill on Catherine. And then the first day of art fair, I actually hit a cyclist, because I have a parking spot there off Catherine. And I was looking forward. I had my turn indicator on.  And when I made that turn, it happened so fast. And luckily he was OK. His bike got completely swallowed by my van. So we walked down here and filed a police report and did everything right. And we were both in total agreement that how dangerous it was.  in terms of not being able to he wasn't even able to see that I had my turn signal on and just headed straight through and we connected so that intersection I actually made a graphic board I couldn't help myself but it it basically that intersection has a smooth green paint job all the way through so there's there's  no indication right here that somebody could be turning. And that's why I'm here, to ask for that. So that both the cyclists and the drivers, I would say, that they have some kind of warning of that possibility.

My name is Faith Redwine-Otieno, and I'm a social worker. I have worked for Washtenaw County Community Mental Health as a support coordinator before my present position as a care coordinator for Michigan Primary Care Association, where I work with 40 fairly qualified health centers, including Packard Health. I'm also a member of the Washtenaw County Social Services Board and the Fund Review Board, to name a few. Since moving to Ann Arbor in June 2016, I have lived in seven different apartment complexes, including my present home at Park Place, owned by McKinsey Properties,  and one privately owned condo as some of you condominiums. The reason for moving often has to do with the cost of housing in Ann Arbor. I have learned that housing doesn't accommodate middle class single parent households or lower income individuals. Housing in Ann Arbor is geared mainly towards higher income families and college students. In addition to this, private landlords or property management companies are not the best landlord. I have lived in private property as some of you only to have a landlord who is more interested in receiving regular monthly income instead of providing safe housing.  Upon moving out, my DTE bill had increased significantly due to faulty window treatment. My current place of residence is worse because my mailbox hasn't broken since moving in, and the washer and dryer downstairs need purchase and debit cards. I had signed a lease to pay $1,399 in rent in April 2023, only to receive a monthly billing statement showing regular rental increases. I paid $1,457.95 for May,  $1,492.30 for June and $1,497.04 for July. I believe cooperative housing is a great idea, and I did suggest this during the funding review team meeting. Cooperatives are affordable and are created to accommodate multiple income levels in addition to having tenants serving on the board to address community concerns. When concerns are raised with property management or private landlords, the issues are not addressed immediately.  In addition to this, some income-based units that are available at some apartment complex are still relatively high in cost. Plus, as thought to be wrong, some subsidized housing complexes are horrible due to negative connotations associated with the word subsidized in poor individuals. We must remember that safe, affordable, livable, and equitable housing is a human right. In fact, one of the social determinants of health includes safe housing.  When individuals are unable to afford or do not receive safe housing, it can affect their mental health, well-being, and quality of life. Thank you for your time.",Housing

I've been a renter, I've been a homeowner, and then I'm back to renting again, thanks to divorce.  I live in Traver Crossing at Barton Drive and Plymouth Road. It's owned by McKinley. The reason I'm there is strictly because of the location. The location is great. Everything else is terrible. It's right across the street from my daughter's school. She's able to walk to her dad's house and to her friend's house. So that's super important. Our two-bedroom is $1,623. With fees and utilities, it's over $1,700 a month. And our rent went up 8% this year.  I feel stuck. I don't want to move out of Ann Arbor. I don't think I should have to move out of Ann Arbor. If you're a renter, there's really no cheaper place than McKinley.  It's not a healthy place to live. We have black mold. And the main problem is the plumbing is from like the 60s. It all needs to be replaced, but that's not... McKinley's never gonna do that because it's way too expensive. So the plumbing continuously leaks and we continually have mold and bad air quality. I've had purse mice three times.  This is when you reach into your purse for something and a mouse leaps out of your purse and onto you. It's become almost like a regular. Anyways, yeah, there's a bad rodent problem. I'm generally pretty laid back. And I wouldn't be so angry if there wasn't such a disconnect between the quality of our living situation and the rent. It's just so incredibly mismatched. There is a new wave of tenant organizing in Ann Arbor, in Ipsy, and statewide.  Because the affordable housing crisis is making people desperate and it's it's totally unsustainable and there's really there is no place to go. Requiring developers to include a handful of affordable units to approve their building, it's completely insufficient. We need people on our side at the state level and the city level who are willing to flat outside with tenants against the big landlords.  This is not like a win-win situation. We need aggressive broad policies like limiting rent increases. We need public housing that's not for profit and that's mixed income because then you can get over, you know, some of the, you know, the negative, you know, stereotypes of public housing.  The landlords are going to fight any effective policy. And we need you to stand with us. That's why we mobilized to the city council meeting tonight. We're going to be mobilizing to Lansing to demand statewide policies. And we would like your support. So thank you for having us.

I'm here to encourage you to vote yes in support of Carytown Concert House's club liquor license application with the city of Ann Arbor.  Carytown Concert House is proud to be entering its 39th year as a non-profit arts venue, a cultural gem in our community that offers a unique opportunity to enjoy exceptional artists in an intimate historical setting that is unlike any other concert experience in Ann Arbor.  This coming 23-24 season, we have plans to present 90 concerts with a culturally diverse and eclectic combination of local, national, and international world-class artists. As the Artistic and Executive Director, I believe this club license is instrumental to the future growth of the organization and would greatly enhance our ability to serve the community and attract folks to the Carytown Farmers Market in Carytown area.  For the past few decades, KCH has routinely applied for and used all 12 allowable special license from the state each year for special events. KCH founders, a club of supporters who give $300 or more annually, have expressed a desire to have more than 12 opportunities to enjoy wine or beer at KCH in a given year.  After decades of going through the arduous process of obtaining the special license, the KCH Board of Trustees now supports a club liquor license for the organization, as it would allow us to more easily build community among its founders club by routinely offering concert afterglows and other events especially for them, such as artists meet and greets, including wine and beer.  It will also help us generate additional revenue for KCH through increased concession sales. And it would allow us to thoughtfully target concerts and special events that would lend themselves well to the inclusion of alcohol concessions, such as concerts held on New Year's Eve or Valentine's Day, our Dance Hall Night Series, our Wine Women and Song Concert Series, or concerts that occur in conjunction with other area events, such as Kindle Fest or Ann Arbor Pride.  It would also offer us the opportunity to give a similar scenario as happens at other iconic venues here in Ann Arbor, such as the Arc and the Michigan Theater. On behalf of the KCH staff and board of trustees, I want to thank you for your favorable consideration of our application and assure you that we will use the license with appropriate care and responsibility. We look forward to your support and also to seeing you at the house for a concert soon. Thank you very much for your time.",Arts and Culture

And I've spent most of that time in McKinley properties. My partner and I currently live at Evergreen. But for some background, my partner lived with roommates in The Villas, which is over on Gulfside, before I joined them here. And in that apartment with McKinley,  The ceiling collapsed twice. Once before I moved in and again after in two different rooms. Still have a plush toy that's got some damage. So you can see why my partner got anxious when we discovered a cabinet door in our current kitchen would no longer open all the way because it was scraping against a drooping ceiling.  We had to report the ceiling three times. At first, we reported just that it was drooping, then that there were cracks that had begun to spread. And finally, after almost two full months with no response, we submitted a report that let them know the ceiling now sagged several feet across. Along with those reports, I had to call at least twice.  In the end, they got a contractor to come out, ignore our instructions to contact us before entering, and get drywall all over our kitchen. They had neglected to put down a tarp or any other potential reasonable protections, so our appliances, countertop, and the floor were coated in debris. And because we weren't informed that they were coming, our cats were exposed to the dust while we were away.  And while the work was being done, we had no easy access to our kitchen to prepare food in our home. We didn't know what to do at the time or who to talk to for help as McKinley had proved unreliable. And that's just one example of sort of what we've dealt with there.  Just providing housing comes with significant responsibilities. It involves management and maintenance. It requires varying costs of insurance. And I'm sure there's so many other concerns I don't know about yet. But as tenants, we pay McKinley to cover these costs and fulfill these responsibilities.

And I'm calling in today to support C1 and say how excited I am to see a mass timber project proposed in Ann Arbor. And so I hope you approve this first reading of C1 tonight.  C1AR zoning seems entirely appropriate for this area. It's right across the street from the athletic campus, near a bunch of other student housing and stuff. And the plan here will provide much needed housing while being way less carbon intensive than most of our other structures in the city. The site plan also provides a free public plaza that's about the size of the library lane surface parking lot, and it provides it at no expense to the city.  So please support C1. Also, while I can't speak to the details of C3, I'm generally supportive of regulations that allow people to make informed decisions. I happen to luck out by purchasing a relatively well-insulated house that isn't incredibly expensive and wasteful to heat and cool, but much of our housing stock is older and poorly insulated. A purchaser may not know they're in for thousands of dollars of insulation work or thousands of dollars of extra energy bills.

And I want to speak to TC1 in opposition to two of the changes that have been proposed to making it easier for car dealerships and car rental agencies to set up shop.  Car dealerships and car rental agencies are densely car-centered businesses. They're businesses that exist because of the car, in order to get you to drive a car, and are completely car-brained. A typical additional new car on the road will rack up thousands, if not tens of thousands of miles. Having any kind of  improvement to the ability for businesses in the city to sell and rent cars is at odds with our stated goals. It's at odds with our goals to reduce vehicle miles traveled because what can you do with the car? You can travel some vehicle miles.  It's at odds with our complete streets because these businesses are very car-dense uses. And it's at odds with pedestrian bicycle safety because the sorts of roads that you get when you have lots of car dealerships are roads effectively known as stroads or street roads.  And some people have wittily referred to them as car sewers because they're wide and they're deep and they're nearly impossible to cross on foot or on bicycle. They're dangerous.

And as a council member, I was frequently accused of being negative to staff or negative to my council members. I've given this a lot of thought. The problem is that we have a local political machine  that is focused on more shiny new things. Staff realizes that they will be roadkill if they don't go along with this amorphous political machine in our community.

We represent 1,100 real estate professionals in the Ann Arbor area. On behalf of our membership, I'm here today to speak in opposition to the Home Energy Rating Disclosure Ordinance.  Although we applaud the city's efforts, this ordinance does little to help the city to achieve the 8 to 0 goals. It targets a small group of owners selling their homes, which is given by the owner to the buyer, who typically does not have the financial resources to act on the recommendations that are presented through the ordinance.  We have worked openly with the city staff and the Energy Commission to thoroughly understand the proposed ordinance and are aware of the city's plans to hire one home energy assessor, even though the ordinance does not include the cost of the assessment for the city to bear this expense.  Keeping in mind that the city staff has also pointed out that they have met with additional firms to help with assessments. Staff is clearly aware that one assessor will not be able to meet the demands in a timely fashion, potentially stalling home sales and or adding additional cost to the transaction.  If you would please, consider our rental housing inspection process as a framework for energy assessment. With as many as five inspectors on staff, it can take several weeks and sometimes several months to have a rental property inspected. Most importantly, and as pointed out in our August 3rd letter to city council, sellers will not be able to meet the advertisement requirements of the ordinance.  Additionally, it's clear from the 30-month report to the Portland City Council that most buyers are not in a financial position to make this kind of improvement needed to increase their score significantly. If by chance they are, realtors locally point out that buyers will prioritize the need to improve their home, such as making updates to kitchens or baths over adding installation to their homes.  Either way, after making one of the largest investments of their lifetime, the facts from the Portland study show that new buyers simply do not choose to make energy-based improvements to their homes. Lastly, let's keep in mind that this is a very basic checklist. It's not a blow-door test. It estimates the cost to heat, cool, and light the property. Rather than an estimate, please remember that buyers can contact DTE and obtain an actual cost for recent years.  Honorable council members, we respectfully ask that you empower city staff to design an incentive based energy assessment program, a model that others will follow a program that will empower all Ann Arbor homeowners to actively participate in achieving the 8 to 0 goals rather than a forced program for sellers who will only face punishment after leaving our great city.

First, CA10, the purchase of a new wood chipper, combined with CA11, the rental of street sweepers.  While I'm in favor of both of these and don't believe they should be at all controversial, the fact that as a city we're willing to purchase or rent new fossil fuel powered devices for these purposes that have spent years delaying the purchase of similar equipment size for bike lanes shows a sort of double think with respect to our environmental goals.  For bike lanes, we're reducing the effectiveness of these energy-saving, emissions-reducing bike lanes by demanding a very high bar for the maintenance equipment that we buy, a bar that we simply are not applying to other purchases by the city. If studied, I would reasonably expect  that purchasing even a diesel-powered street sweeper for the bike lanes that would allow us to make them properly separated and protected would have net negative emissions due to the car trips that would be turned into bike trips. The same cannot be said for either of the items on these orders tonight. If we truly want to meet our 80-0 goals,  we should be willing to do the potentially unpalatable but still very effective things to help achieve these goals, especially if we're willing and able to do those same unpalatable things for goals unrelated to H2O. Second, I'd like to speak on the TC1 amendment, C2. I'm  deeply concerned about the addition of automobile-related uses, even with a special exception as primary uses. There's no indication that these exceptions will be within the spirit of TC1, and the addition of automobile-related uses as a valid primary use runs a strong risk of entirely defeating the purpose of the TC1 district.  Please reconsider this. Finally, I'd like to request that the city make a bike lane gap dashboard similar to the very useful sidewalk gap dashboard we have. This dashboard should not simply be bike lane or no bike lane, but rather include a level of service. 30 seconds. And abilities. No bike lane is obviously a gap, but painted bicycle gutters or even buffered bike lanes that have a whole  Two strips of paint a car would have to cross to kill a bicyclist are woefully insufficient. We need safe infrastructure and council should be aware of the current state of our infrastructure. The dashboard's one step to that. Thank you.",Environment and Sustainability

And I'm calling with regards to C1, which is a rezoning with conditions for the block bounded by State, Stimson, Henry, and White Streets, commonly known as South Town. The conditional zoning request should be denied for the following reasons. It is the kind of conditional zoning that the courts have  very clearly ruled against. And it would create significant possible repercussions to property owners and tenants from many blocks nearby in the area commonly known as Lower Burns Park. And there is a legal remedy. The same exact site plan could be approved in a different manner that would be legal. The way it's applied for is not, I suggest you speak with your city attorney about that for a more formal opinion, but this is very similar  So what happened with the Garnet, which was voted down because the conditional zoning there was not legal, but it was later approved with the exact same plan with the PUD. So let me focus on some of the ramifications of doing it this way. Right now, the city has decided that short-term rentals that are not owner-occupied should not be allowed, not permitted.  in areas that are residentially zoned. That would include dislocation, but it would also include everything along State Street between State and White as you go up north from here, Stadium, Granger, McKinley, Dewey was in there, all the way up to Arch where north of Arch it's already zoned for something that would permit short-term rentals. So you take all these areas that are not intended for short-term rentals per our law,  And if you approve this one with the condition, in this case, they're going to allow short-term rentals, but they're going to cap it to a certain amount. Conditional zoning for the next person that applies in one of these places up and down State Street, across from University of Michigan's athletic facilities, you can't say no to the next person because conditional zoning has to be voluntary by the developer. And you can't turn them down for not volunteering what the last one did.  30 seconds. You're backing into a situation where you're going to be forced to approve potentially downtown height buildings or a conversion of those houses, as is, into short-term rental situations, removing from our long-term rental stock in an area that, right now, it's mostly student rental, but there's also a lot of families that live there. So whether you're an owner-occupant or a tenant, we risk  losing long-term housing stock in favor of short-term housing by accident. If we did this deliberately as part of the comprehensive plan revisions, so be it. I'm not backing into it. Thank you.",Housing

I moved to Ann Arbor about a year ago from Evanston.  where my partner was a graduate student at Northwestern. It's a very similar kind of college town. And there, we rented a one-bedroom apartment about 550 square feet for $1,200 a month. We anticipated moving here that we'd be able to find similar rentals because the cost of living comparisons suggest that Ann Arbor is only 1.5% to 2% more expensive than Evanston. We were shocked then to discover  that a comparable apartment here is $1,600 a month, which is 33% more expensive than what we were paying. It is particularly egregious because salaries here are about the same as they are in Evanston. So this represents a large percentage of our income. I rent from McKinley Properties at Traver Crossing now, which we have found to be less than desirable. We've had issues with mold.  a hot water heater that is constantly in and out of service, as well as struggling to get any kind of maintenance for things as simple as a light switch repair. Public spaces, for example, the laundry room is consistently covered in mold, has standing water, and roof ceiling tiles that disintegrate and are not repaired despite repeated requests for maintenance.  We've had five property managers since I've been here, which is only a year. So there's been no continuity in management for tenants. And just a very small example of the lack of respect for tenants, the washing machines changed from being coin-operated to being app-operated recently. The app itself is buggy, and in its privacy policy, it says that  Not only does it collect all of your data, your demographics, your location, your employment, your name, your birthday, your email, your phone number, it can and will sell it to third parties and other vendors that they can use in their marketing materials. And I don't know about you, but I don't really like it when my washing machine is selling my data. So I tried to use a wash card where you pre-fill it. But the pre-filling card station is located in the property management office.  which has been closed all summer because our property manager is managing four other properties and has been unable to be on the property at all. This is not what I signed up for. This is not what we pay for. And I'm really hoping that Ann Arbor City Council will continue its work for tenants' rights to make these situations better.

I'm here as a renter, a member of the Graduate Employee Organization Housing Caucus, and a member of the McKinley Tenants Association. My five years as a renter at Travers Crossing, a McKinley property in Ward 1, have been defined by the mismanagement of my rental property, including management authorizing entry into my apartment for repair without my permission or notification, urgent maintenance tickets for things like backup kitchen sinks getting left unassigned by management for days at a time.  an exterior building door that was jammed shut for two days during the winter, such that the only exit to my building was an iced-over door not maintained for winter use, and the same exterior door being left unlocked without a handle for weeks, even as I received notifications from the property to beware of package theft and multiple emails from the management office left unanswered.  It's logical to ask why I haven't moved to a different property. But last year, after management increased my rent by $125 per month, and then, as I was deciding whether or not to remove my lease, retracted this offer and raised my rent an additional $50 per month, I tried to find a new apartment. I soon learned that McKinley Properties owns 60% of the workforce housing in Washtenaw County, making it nearly impossible to leave a McKinley property.  When I did find some alternatives, each property had a waitlist for new tenants and a waitlist fee, usually around $350. Even though these fees are refundable, a spot on a waitlist did not guarantee a unit, and I would need to make multiple deposits or run the risk of not getting an apartment. I could not afford to pay hundreds of dollars in waitlist fees, essentially interest-free loans to landlords, but also could not risk finding myself without an apartment. So I was forced to stay in my McKinney apartment.  Again, this spring, when it came time for my renewal, the new lease came along with a $220 per month increase and an increase to late fees and pet fees. Last time I spoke at a city council meeting, it was in support of the right to renew ordinance, which passed last fall. This, along with the early leasing ordinance and creation of the renter commission, marked important steps the council has taken toward giving security to tenants and holding landlords accountable. But there is much more that can and needs to be done. First, eliminating both refundable and non-refundable fees that prohibit many renters  from finding, moving from, or staying in an apartment. Second, ensuring that existing ordinances and building codes are enforced, and proactively addressing tenant issues by working with the Renters Commission to expand renter protection. And finally, endorsing the effort to repeal the statewide rent stabilization preemption and refer local government power to make laws about equitable rent.  She used the words of McKinley CEO Albert Barrett, who spoke on a Claims Detroit podcast last year. 30 seconds. 100% of Washtenaw County, if not just 60%.

Sometimes it doesn't take a revisionist to enlighten us about the exaggerations we find in the Holocaust narrative. Often the enlightenment comes at the hands of the Holocaust traditionalists themselves. Recommended reading from the Anna Republic School's Holocaust curriculum is the well-known novel Night by the famous Elie Wiesel, page 32.  Not far from us, huge flames were rising from a ditch. Something was being burned there. A truck drew close and unloaded its hold. Small children, babies. Yes, I did see this with my own eyes. Children thrown into the flames. Is it any wonder that ever since then, sleep tends to elude me?  And in another book by the same author, The Jews of Silence, he writes about the alleged massacre of 33,000 Jews in Babi Yar in the Ukraine.  From page 48, we read, eyewitnesses say that for months after the killings, the ground continued to spurt geysers of blood. Without supporting evidence, Wiesel wants us to believe that blood spurted out of the ground in geyser-like fashion for months, when no one has ever seen such an occurrence. But in a third book, Legends of Our Time, Wiesel comes clean.  In the introduction, he writes about a conversation with the local rabbi. What are you writing, the rabbi asked, stories. I said he wanted to know what kind of stories, true stories. About people you knew? Yes, about people I might have known. About things that happened? Yes, about things that happened or could have happened. But they did not? No, not all of them did.  In fact, some were invented from almost the beginning to almost the end. The rabbi leaned forward as if to measure me up and said with more sorrow than anger, that means you are writing lies. I did not answer immediately. The scolded child within me had nothing to say in his defense, yet I had to justify myself. Things are not that simple, rabbi. Some events do take place but are not true.  Others are, although they never occurred. What will the reaction of Ann Arbor students be when they read of such an admission? Thank you.",Israel-Palestine

And I'm calling about CA9, the repayment of the bonds for the old Y lot. I'd ask that you pull it from the consent agenda and discuss it. The millage, you know, governmental accounting is a little bit different than regular corporate accounting. I'm a treasurer for a nonprofit, so I have to deal with some of the aspects of that.  When citizens vote for a millage, there's specific items in that language on what the money is to be used for. And there's certain expectations that come along with that. So I think it would be helpful for the citizens to hear the complexities of this issue and to understand and be satisfied or not with how this matter is being handled, how our millage money is being spent. This is nearly one year's  one full year's amount of the affordable housing knowledge that we voted in. And one of the things that was said and that our expectations were based on is the idea that we could actually get affordable housing built if we did it on city-owned lots because we already own the land. Well, if we're having to pay for that land, that starts to make that a little bit more complex. And one of the other things we talked about was  not having the units sunset, revert to market rate, because it's a city owned lot. We can control that. But there's a possibility here of building about half market rate units and about half affordable housing units. And the possibility that some of the lot could be sold. So it'd be sure nice to know, you know, if we pay now that affordable housing knowledge,  or to pay down the debt here. And then market rate housing is built with half the money come back to the affordable housing note. If the land is going to be sold, how do we know that the units are going to be there forever as opposed to some setting? You know, maybe it's all worked out, but it'd be great for the public to hear you discuss that. So I've asked you to pull from that consent agenda so we can have that conversation. Um,  I'd also like to talk about the affordable housing in general. One of the ways we get affordable housing money and affordable housing units, besides our millage, is through PUDs. And there have been PUDs that provide actual units, and a lot of them provide payment in lieu. We are in jeopardy, very shortly, of approving a development that is approved as a PUD. 30 seconds.  would provide 33 units of affordable housing. Now, I sure hope it doesn't go away that Lower Town did, where we lost 93 units of affordable housing to nothing but corporate profit. In this case, I've heard some arguments why South Town should not be approved as a PUD, but I've not heard a single argument that legally holds any water whatsoever. And it will cost us 33 units of affordable housing and great legal exposure to the city. Thank you.",Housing

Now at 4.3.4%.  And it keeps going up, all right? Why is it going up? Because the market's pushing it up. Why is the market pushing it up? Because of inflation expectations, all right? A currency crisis is when the currency that we use loses its purchasing power. This is municipal because this applies to society, okay? This is our community that we need to step in and help. Loses purchasing power. It stops functioning. It doesn't work like it used to. And this manifests in rising prices.  And this added cost of living essentially makes everyone poor.

As the currency continues to erode, life gets harder, resources get stretched, the cost of everything keeps going up. Inflation precipitates societal decline.  59% of people with student loan debt have said that when student loan payments resume next month, that they will need to make a choice between making their debt payment or buying groceries.

So, I study this a lot, and I'm fairly convinced this is what's happening, and it's pretty scary. So I want the city to  at least consider these words and what this could mean for our future.

The other thing that I'm concerned about is reading the papers yesterday, there was a comment about maybe Native Americans should be included in this initiative as well. Well, let me be clear. I'm not opposed to any group seeking reparations for their community.  But I am opposed to including other groups into this reparation initiative for blacks, because there's been initiatives that have been stimulated by blacks in the past, and we've been the least to benefit from those. Other groups have benefited from the efforts that we put forth to bring about change for our community, but it's only benefited other communities as well.

I will note the challenges of building housing on what is almost certainly a brownfield site. Car dealerships are not known for, I guess,  Car-centered businesses in general are known for their pollution of groundwater and other things. There's a whole bunch of concrete on the site. There's going to be a lot of work to clear it and prepare it.

I don't have any special knowledge, but that just seems to be likely.  I'm looking forward to more neighbors on that site. It's been bleak for quite a while. Most of it was cleared. There was a building, a five-sided car dealership building, which I'm sure someone thought of as historic at some point in time. But now it's just bare and vacant. And I'm looking forward to the efforts, which I'm sure will be complicated and involve details of public finance that are beyond me to make it all work.  I will say that the city does have a history of successful transition of car dealerships to other uses, just like we have a history of transition of gas stations to other uses. And I'll point as an example to the Whole Foods site on Washtenaw that if you have a long memory, or if you don't have a long memory but have looked it up somewhere, used to be a car dealership there.  So it's entirely possible to take a site that was acres of parking and turn it into something that's a dense use.

First, I'd like to see the inclusion of an explicit mention of life-saving pedestrian and bicycle safety devices followed in the list of speed control elements. As despite being a part of NACTO guidelines, the city appears entirely unwilling to do the trade-off of  some potential damage to a car that has left the roadway in return for the enormous benefit of not killing someone.

And that is something that Sam Schwartz recommends, Sam Schwartz, a consultant who did Vision Zero,  There's an excellent example of what they did with the busway on 14th Street in New York City. So we need to be more methodical in our implementation and consider those unintended consequences. Next, we need to look at school crosswalks. I brought this forward at the last meeting, and I was really concerned about overgrown vegetation, because that's one of my pet peeves. But the first three people I showed it to said  Why isn't the crosswalk marked? It's like, I don't know. And then I checked and the crosswalk design guidelines, which we spent considerable time on, definitely specifies that it should be marked. And so, again,  and unintended consequences, we overlook this. And when I went down there today, I counted over 50 cars that were parked along this area, including right through the crosswalks, because I don't think parents even knew it was a crosswalk because it wasn't marked. My last area is that we are wrongly charging people and endangering pedestrians. And one example is the corner of Beaks  Kingsley and Main Street. There was a greyhound bus driver who hit a pedestrian. I've gone down there, I've looked at it, other engineers have looked at it also. It is humanly impossible to see a pedestrian in that crosswalk because there is inadequate lighting at the crosswalk and there are bright globes that the DDA put in just beyond that. So you're looking at a glare  and you can't even see a pedestrian there. So I hope that you will implement safer crosswalks. Thank you.",Transportation and Mobility

And like other people, I'll pick a theme. My theme will be expectations. And I talked about this last time this was a council, that the citizens when they  voted for the affordable housing millage had certain expectations. And some of that expectation was based on the language of the millage. Some of that expectation was based on things like putting affordable housing units on the old Y lot, which has been talked about for a long time. One of the key reasons that we were gonna have city-owned lots that we already own made available for affordable housing  to keep the cost down. So the expectations were not necessarily met when we had to find out how much money had to be spent to buy the lot that we already own. This is all covered the last time. So I understand where we're at with that now. And there may be good uses for the rest of the money. But again, expectations. Citizens should have a discussion of why the rest of the money is going where it's going, even if it's a good reason.  Because we voted on a village, we have certain expectations of that. While we're talking about affordable housing, we have certain expectations. There's 93 people that we are not housing because our citizens had our expectations broken when the city improperly, illegally approved the lower town plan. 93 units or $9 million of affordable housing that was lost.  And a PUD in disguise, the exact same plan. It's built as a PUD, and there's no reason it wasn't built as a PUD except to avoid 93 units of affordable housing. There's 93 people or more, because it could be more than one person per unit, that are not going to get that affordable housing. Later on tonight, we're going to talk about 33 people, 33 units of affordable housing that you're ready to give away, benefiting private interests,  and not following the law, yet again. When we vote the affordable housing bill, we also had discussion about 415 West Washington and not using Miller's money there because that site didn't qualify well for affordable housing in terms of tax credit and other federal reasons, because slugs laying next to the tracks, et cetera. 30 seconds. We've broken those expectations. And we're going to use a PUD there  It's kind of inconsistent when we say PUD to pay when it's not okay. We'll use a PUD there to put money into a payment in lieu, and then that payment in lieu is just going to get taken off the top, and we're going to get net zero money for affordable housing at 415 West Washington, in part because we didn't follow the expectations that were set. So, please. Thank you.",Housing

I'm calling tonight to thank the sponsors of DC2 and to request that you approve this resolution. Our neighborhood has been frustrated by speeding drivers for years, and while some of our streets have received traffic calming, the existing process for having your road calmed is incredibly cumbersome. Streamlining this process and making it automatic during major road work is a great improvement. Furthermore, this model of choosing safety by default should be applied to other road work as well.  I noticed, for example, the recent Packard resurfacing left the lanes excessively wide, didn't buffer the bike lanes, and actually decreased safety by removing the gateway treatments at crosswalks and the green paint in bike conflict zones. It would have been nearly free to make safety improvements during this project simply by painting slightly different lines on the road. We should not leave opportunities like this on the table. DC2 will help fix this in neighborhood streets, but we definitely need some better defaults elsewhere too.  So, once again, please approve DC2 and consider expanding this to the safety by default concept to major roads in a future resolution. Thank you.",Transportation and Mobility
AA_09_05_23,AA,"Ann Arbor, MI",2023-09-05,2023-09-01,Inferred,Public Comment,Commenter,1508.508,1702.583,"Greetings, Council. I'm calling in support of D.C. 's three resolutions to improve data transparency and performance management. I want to thank the authors and sponsors and make honorable mention to John Murphy, who would never want credit for it, but has been years championing city goals that are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound, otherwise known as SMART goals. I appreciate that this resolution highlights the importance of transparency and performance management,  and direct federal implementation process begins. And for people following along as home performance management, according to the Society for Human Resource Management, it's defined as the process of maintaining or improving employee job performance through the use of performance assessment tools, coaching, and counseling, as well as providing continuous feedback.  The last time I addressed Council in person was exactly a year and a half ago on the night that the City Administrator was hired. At that time, I encouraged you to start working on your most important job, evaluating the City Administrator. I recommended doing so intramurally on a quarterly basis with perhaps a more formal evaluation on an annual basis. To my knowledge, in the intervening time, not one Administrator or City Attorney evaluation has been done.  I hope that adopting this resolution sets Council and staff on a path toward accountability and achievement. In order to be effective, though, I believe this resolution must be expanded. I have three suggestions. One is to agree on goals. The resolution makes reference to key performance indicators, but lacks the suggestion of what the key ones are or how to determine them. This should not be left up to staff. Only Council can answer this question, and you should begin a process to determine which ones you really care about. What success looks like  and a time frame that's achievable. For example, are there any outcomes that you care about so much that you would give the city administrator a poor performance review if he didn't achieve it? I hope each of you can think of at least some, and then you can come to consensus on many of them. I want to know what those are, and I'm sure many of the people in the community do too. I hope that in the next budget cycle, it will be clear where money and staffing should be allocated. Number two, start basic evaluations now.  Performance management is critical and it's something that shouldn't wait until this process is complete. Please begin evaluating the administrator or at least the general criteria that have been used in the past. Direct the administrator to begin quarterly reviews of senior staff and reboot council working sessions to get updates from senior staff and give you and the public the opportunity to ask questions. Three, finally set a timeline. I find it ironic that this resolution repeatedly emphasizes accountability but itself fails to mention any timeline.  Please give staff a deadline to pull together a one-pager on current versus best practices in performance management and data transparency, and work out a rough timeline for achieving the rest of the steps in your resolution. Please start the accountability now. I want to add that putting the prioritization and dashboard process in place, which will take several months, is not an excuse for continuing the lack of progress on critical issues like zoning and housing, and the backsliding on loan safety.  Thanks for your time and attention and moving forward on the timeline for this resolution.",Governance and Civic Engagement

I am a limited license social worker who graduated with my MSW from University of Michigan 2020. I work for disability network Washington member Livingston and I and my organization  Support the passing of Resolution 23-14-69, directing the city administrators to advocate for the Michigan legislature to end the use of 14C certificates in the state of Michigan. Disability Network originally formed as the Ann Arbor Center for Independent Living almost 50 years ago, making us the fourth oldest center for independent living in the country. So much has changed for people with disabilities since 1976.  For starters, lifelong institutionalization is no longer the ever-present threat to people with disabilities that it was, and Americans are much more accustomed to the idea of people with disabilities living full, independent, fulfilling lives, including working the same jobs that non-disabled folks do. Employment opportunities for people with disabilities have increased exponentially with the help of technology and state, federal, and workplace policies.  but an 85-year-old policy is still holding people with disabilities back from full inclusion in the workplace. And this is Section 14C of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. I'm sure it's becoming increasingly clear to the honorable members of this council that the state minimum wage of $10.10 an hour is not enough to get by in the city of Ann Arbor anymore, but it is still legal for some people to be paid less than $1 an hour in Michigan thanks to this policy.  A business, community vocational organization, or educational institution can apply for a federal waiver which allows them to use a convoluted formula with virtually no oversight to pay people with disabilities based on their observed productivity on the job. People without disabilities do not need to have their productivity measured to determine their wages, so why is this still the case for people with disabilities?  The arguments for keeping sub-minimum wage are often effervescent of the shortcomings of other government policies designed to keep people with disabilities out of poverty. And it is true that these policies often require people with disabilities to monitor and report their earnings and assets in order to keep receiving assistance. But organizations like ours, Disability Network, that provide benefits  such as services, such as benefits counseling, excuse me, which allows a person with a disability to see how much they can work at a competitively compensated job. 30 seconds. All right. Several advocates with intellectual and developmental disabilities in Michigan are currently pushing for a state law that includes a phase-out plan that involves connecting from a minimum wage earners to local resources that already exist.  I hope that Michigan joins the 13 states that have currently banned the use of 14 CWOA certificates and support the passing of this resolution.

I am both the wheelchair user and the founding director of an organization called Detroit disability power and I want to thank the clerk and the city council for inviting me today.  It is a great honor to be in the company of folks like Zach Damon and Councilwoman Aisha Ghazi-Edwin to support the Disability Voting Rights Week proclamation. This is something that is important for raising awareness and I want to give you a real brief story about why that is. I mentioned I'm a wheelchair user and that I started the Disability Justice Organization.  And a lot of that has to do with my experience as a regular, excited, enthusiastic voter. Many times when I have gone to vote in my wheelchair, I have struggled to do so. I actually live in Detroit, not in Ann Arbor. But what I have learned over the years is that the challenges around accessible voting are not in a singular place, but very common throughout the country.  So back in 2018, I went to vote in my wheelchair. I was very pleased to get into the building to get my ballot. And then I turned around to figure out where I would go fill it out. And there was absolutely nowhere that I could reach from my wheelchair. All of the booths were standing height, and there was nowhere for me to vote. And when I turned around to ask the woman who had signed me in where I should go, she didn't have an answer. And while she was very kind,  She clearly, no one there, had clearly thought about, oh, what do we do if a wheelchair-using voter comes in today? How do we accommodate someone who moves through this world differently? And so after a few minutes of consulting each other, they cleared off the table in the back. I was able to vote privately and independently. That night, I happened to have an advisory meeting of my organization, all of whom were other people with various disabilities.  And as I shared the story of what happened, each of them shared similar stories. These are blind people, people with cognitive disabilities, other people with mobility disabilities. But every single one of us had a story of a challenge voting. Fast forward, very important election of 2020. I showed up to vote. I wanted to use the accessible voting machine. I apparently was the first person that day to ask to do it.  No one there at the precinct knew how to turn it on or what the code was. I waited about 45 minutes while they played phone tag with the others in the headquarters of the clerk's office. And at the end of the day, I was able to vote on the voting machine, but they couldn't tabulate my vote because the paper was a different size than what normally goes in the tabulator from a paper ballot. So I actually left that election not knowing if my vote counted.  And again, it just reinforced that there are lots of different ways that problems can come up on election day, but none of them are unpreventable. Both stories I just told you could easily be solved with a little more training and preparation. And so in 2022, my organization, Detroit Disability Power, worked with the Carter Center down in Atlanta to do a massive audit of Metro Detroit polling sites.  to determine where the accessibility problems were. And while we didn't come to Ann Arbor, we focused on 15 jurisdictions in Southeast Michigan, and the results that came back were very troubling, although not surprising. Of those 261 polling sites that we audited on election day in November of 2022, only 16% were fully accessible.  And so when we look at this data, we know that that means that voter turnout of disabled residents is lower than it should be. We know that people aren't able to vote like they should and are entitled to, and that we have some work to do. And so we are working with very cooperative clerks like yours to ensure that we're  fixing the problems, especially the low hanging fruit problems. There's many of these problems that don't cost money to fix, but also tackling the harder problems like the infrastructure that needs to be altered to make sure that people can get in the building and vote.  So this report is available. It's also, we have lots of briefings and workshops to learn how to make these polling places accessible. There's a lot more I could say about that, but what I'm really here to say today is that I'm very excited for this proclamation. Disability Voting Rights Week is a great way to raise awareness about these things, and I appreciate the time and attention that you're putting towards it.",Governance and Civic Engagement

It sets safety as the default, and I think that is what we should come to expect as a community. I think we should know by now, we have the information available to us that  our roads are not safe, that they're designed for cars and not humans. I believe that neighborhood streets should be a place that's safe for kids to play and for people to be people, for people to gather and congregate. And I think that the more we can do to  calm traffic, the more we can make those things a reality. And I think that we have other opportunities as well. So pass this tonight for sure. But I'd like to see something coming forward in the future that calms traffic by default on major roads by doing road diets, where  You know, anytime we repave a road, anytime we repave a major road, that we know for sure that there's going to be a road diet unless there's a very good reason not to do a road diet. And staff better explain to us why they didn't do a road diet on a particular street.  I'm real excited to see the traffic calming resolution because safety should be something that we can count on, not something that we have to beg for. So please pass EC2 tonight.

This is absolutely fantastic.  But I'd love to see some city funding going to improving the park and its non-car connectivity too. Many people come to that park from the other side of I-94, meaning they either have to take the pedestrian bridge from Mary Beth Doyle Park and then walk along Ellsworth, or they have to use the Platt Road Bridge, which has five lanes of speeding traffic on it, narrow, unbuffeted, and unprotected bike lanes, and narrow sidewalks.  Even just a lane re-striping to remove the turning lane from the bridge itself and provide buffers for the bike lanes would improve it tremendously, and there is even more improvement that I'm sure our engineers could come up with at the same time. I'd also like to continue pointing out that as a city, we're still underperforming on our goals.  Our progress on an all-ages and abilities bike network has been poor. Fully a quarter of our total planned sidewalks in the city remain unbuilt, and at our current pace it will take us another century to build them. We continue to wait for years for traffic calming projects, with the petitions for both CA4 and CA5 having been submitted all the way back in 2020.  We continue to have empty lots where it's not even legal to build a duplex because of outdated zoning laws and setbacks. And we continue to allow new construction with even more space dedicated to cars than to human beings. We continue to subsidize parking with underpriced or free government-funded parking provided all over streets all across town.  All of this contributes to automobile emissions, which are one of the largest forms of greenhouse gas emissions, not just in the city where it's even larger than the portions set aside nationwide, but in fact in the country and the world. If we're going to be serious about climate, if we're going to be serious about safety, we really need to focus  on getting our transportation. Thank you.",Transportation and Mobility

I represent two creative companies, Treetown Murals and Brush Monkeys. We have been serving Washtenaw County and the southeastern Michigan for over 20 years, bringing public art and window art to different neighborhoods and cities. Today I'm here to talk about consent agenda number six for all of you. It's the murals that bridge project.  We are identifying two major gateways to our community, one being the Huron underpass over here and then North Main Street. North Main Street is actually where I got my start as a public artist. The painting there still exists. It's very much in need of repair. But we've used this foothold to bring this new project to the residents and visitors of Ann Arbor.  This project is not only going to restore the wing walls, but also the fascia beam. So this is the first time actually the metal overpass that goes over the roads will be identified for public art. And because of that, we need a right-of-way permit. We will be closing the lanes one at a time in order to access the fascia beam.  We have hired Northstar Painting to do the restoration of the overpass. And it wasn't until recently that MDOT told us that Treetown Murals, Watco, and Northstar are actually not eligible to file the road permit.  So we have had to lean on the city of Ann Arbor to represent this project for us. And thank you to those who have already cooperated immensely on city staff to get us even on this agenda today. This project was slated to start in July and here we are in September. So it goes without saying that we're kind of moving this as fast as possible, hopefully at least getting the restoration done and maybe the wing walls painted and hopefully the whole project before the end of 2023.  free.  Now this is a twofold project. So tying into the bicentennial of next year, we hope to do the restoration and new murals on the North Main. And again, creating welcoming messaging to people coming into our community is kind of the big overhaul here. So today with consent agenda number six, we're looking for approval from the city to kind of go through with this project that the city would file the row on our behalf.  And that we could just kind of get going with the MDOT approvals now. I also serve as a public art commissioner Here in Ann Arbor and we've never had to deal with this aesthetic enhancement criteria that MDOT is putting for us But it's also just a great kind of learning curve for future public art projects So this is probably not the first time you will see this on your agenda given that 2024 we want to do this again so we are looking to  have the city support us and moving forward with this project.

I'm almost certain that among the members of council and me, I'm the only one who actually knew Kathy and witnessed the political events that took place at that time. As far as I know, there are no statues of any person in public view anywhere in the city of Ann Arbor. This is not a good time to start and this is not the right person to start with.  Kathy is to be honored for being the first openly gay or lesbian candidate to be elected to public office in this country. Note, Kathy wasn't the first person to be out while in office. That distinction is believed to belong to two members of this council who preceded her, Jerry DeGreek and Nancy Wexler, who came out while on council. She also wasn't the first openly gay or lesbian candidate for public office. That distinction probably belongs to the legendary San Francisco gay activist Harvey Milk.  Milk was elected to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in 1977. He was assassinated by a conservative member of that body within a year of his election.  Milk had run also as an openly gay man in 1973, before Cathy ran, but lost. He had the disadvantage of having to run and win citywide, while Cathy had only to prevail in the predominantly student and decidedly gay-friendly Second Ward, which is already represented by Nancy Wexler.  The resolution describes Kathy as a beacon of courage, but she disagrees. She said, I don't think I was brave because I was in a college town and it was cool to be who I was.  Nancy Wexler agrees. She said, in Ann Arbor in 1974, we had pretty much gotten everything we wanted for gay people by then. There wasn't really a debate over gay rights in her ward. So what were Cathy's contributions to the city of Ann Arbor besides this historical footnote? The resolution doesn't cite anything else that Cathy did except that she was an activist student at the University of Michigan. That covers many tens of thousands of people.  There are many other Ann Arborites who actually made major and lasting contributions to the life and history of the city who would be more deserving of such an honor. But in its 200th year as a city, Ann Arbor doesn't really need to start erecting bronze monuments to people. And if it did, choosing Kathy Kosychenko to be the first one isn't sound governance. It's pandering and virtue signaling. This action should be reversed.",Governance and Civic Engagement

I want to talk about an outstanding issue and then some positive action that's happened over the last week. But first, this is the crosswalk that I have been talking about.  Why hasn't staff addressed the concerns? And in one case, and I outlined this in the memo, the crosswalk sign is more than six feet in front of the actual crosswalk. So trimming was done around the crosswalk sign and then there is a wall of vegetation before you get to the crosswalk. Defies logic.  And you may say, why am I addressing this to council? Council sets budgets and council passes policies. That's absolutely right. But council passes budgets and sets policies for new programs, new programs. That's what we do in Ann Arbor. We don't evaluate our programs, even though that's very important with Vision Zero. We don't have feedback loops. We just go on to the next project.  And it's extremely frustrating as someone who's been to Vision Zero training to see us cherry pick aspects of it. We are not reducing our pedestrian crashes. We are not meeting our safety goals as we heard earlier. Now for the good news. I went to many of the house party events this week.  And it exceeded all of my expectations. It was so wonderful talking to people who I didn't necessarily agree with, but.  They listened to me, I listened to them, and I learned so much. It was wonderful. And one of the things that came out of it is that construction costs for middle-income families exceeds the market rate of that property in Ann Arbor. And that means that private developers will not be building middle-income housing in Ann Arbor.  It's not financially feasible. But there are ways to build thousands of units, and that is with  Community Land Trust, working with the University of Michigan. The county right now is looking at a housing commission that would support not only low-income housing, but also middle-income housing. So I believe that we are going to have some plans that are very complicated, but are going to be made public in the next few weeks.

Asshole. Kathy Kozachenko was a great woman.  Still is, although she's been out of politics for many years. Not only great because she stood for gay and lesbian rights when that was harder than it is now, but great because she stood loudly in this room, in this city council, stood loudly for Palestinian human rights. Bless her for that.  So yeah, I want to see the statute of her, even though this city council is airbrushing out her Palestinian rights activism, even though this city council is reducing her to a one-dimensional cardboard character. She was multi-dimensional and a human rights fighter. The one thing that this city council has fought for uninterruptedly from January of 1984 until now  has been to kill Palestinians. This city council has stood hard and fast against any Palestinian rights resolution, against any Palestinian rights resolution since January of 1984, right up to now, right up to now. This city council domestically has a policy  Domestic policy is to build on every available inch of land so much luxury housing for the filthy rich in Ann Arbor that everyone else is driven out because they cannot afford the rent. That's their domestic policy. Their domestic policy also is proclaiming themselves to be all about equity as they're turning Ann Arbor more and more lily white and more and more filthy rich.  It's a twin policy. Their foreign policy, and you can see they have a foreign policy, their foreign policy is to fight like hell to protect Israel as it keeps massacring Palestinians. That is their unchanging foreign policy.  This city council has fought. And there goes Jen Eyre. Of course, she's running out of the room. She took campaign money. Jen Eyre took campaign money from old friends of the Israel Defense Forces. And guess who just got appointed by this city council to oversee the police of Ann Arbor? An old honcho of the Friends of the Israel Defense Forces.  That shows, and city council was warned that that's a bad idea. Yet they did it without hesitation. This is a racist city council through and through.",Israel-Palestine

I'd like to talk about conditional zoning. I've written you  And spoken, the conditional zoning is complicated and counterintuitive. And I really wish we would have addressed it more publicly when we spoke about Southtown, where there was a conditional zoning. Unfortunately, council members, not all of you, some of you, chose to make disparaging comments about your constituents rather than addressing the meat of the arguments and the issues that were raised by those speakers at that meeting about Southtown.  That was unseemly. Unseemly. Where have we heard that word recently? When we were talking about conditional zoning at Lowertown, Lisa Dish used that word. After making some comments that were completely incorrect about conditional zoning regarding the third phase of Lowertown, she criticized people who were  proposing things for that project that they were hoping the developer might deliver on as unseemly things to ask for. Things like, oh, affordable housing, or sustainability in the form of further electrification. Maybe retail instead of a second pool, only half mile from Fuller Pool. I don't think those things were unseemly. You may differ in your opinion about it. But certainly, you were incorrect, Lisa, in your statements about conditional zoning.  because it was not the case that this was somebody applying for a project with conditional zoning. It was a developer who had already had conditional zoning put upon their property, asking for it to be removed. Very different. Let's get back to Southtown. There were a lot of meaty issues that could have been discussed, and most of them were not discussed. For example, we could have debated, discussed at the council table,  the non-primary residence short-term rental issue. Not too long ago, the city passed an ordinance banning those in residential zoning. Recently, more recently than that, in crafting the TC1 zoning, they were banned in TC1 as well. So we have residential zoning being converted to non-residential zoning, and in this case, Southtown, giving them up to 60 units  Are we giving a monopoly to this particular developer, or are we opening the door for more? That would have been a good point for discussion, rather than spending your time disparaging your constituents. I hope we have a better discussion next time. Thank you.",Housing

Uh, last year in 2022, the city council's ad hoc committee on housing and safety was working on a fair chance housing ordinance.  We at Nation Outside view housing as a fundamental human right. Passing the Fair Chance Housing Ordinance would demonstrate the City of Lansing is willing to support people who are committed to rectify their mistakes, redefine themselves, and make meaningful contributions to the community. People who have served their time and seek to provide for themselves and their families face significant barriers in finding adequate housing.  This ordinance, when you get back to reconsidering it, would give previously incarcerated people the opportunity to find safe and affordable housing within the city limits. According to research, housing helps reduce recidivism and build safer communities. People who have stable housing are more likely to maintain employment, seek more education, and less likely to engage in any criminal activity.  Landlords and rental management companies often deny leasing to anyone with a criminal record. As individuals complete their sentences and return to the community, it's only right that they have a fair chance at a fresh start in a safe environment.  The Fair Chance Housing Ordinance allows people with criminal records to complete an initial screening process before disclosing their conviction history. Landlords retain the right to conduct background checks after a conditional lease is offered, and to deny applicants whose record would impact public safety, property, or other tenants.  However, people would be given the chance to offer evidence of rehabilitation prior to the final denial by the landlord. We ask that the city of Lansing make it a priority to adopt a fair chance housing ordinance in 2023.",Housing

I've experienced the denials. My name's Adam Grant. I'm the executive director of A Brighter Way. I have nearly an 800 credit score and I can't get the house above my mother-in-law, the apartment above my mother-in-law because I served time in prison for a bank robbery that I committed in 1993. These are not  I don't even think the ordinance goes far enough, let me say that first. Because I work in Ypsilanti and I see how these ordinance can be bastardized and how they can be misused.  Because one of the things that happens down there is that you have management companies who aren't based out of Ann Arbor or Ypsilanti so that they can do the business according to the laws in Ohio or whatever the case may be. The fact is we're talking about people's lives. We're talking about their livelihood. And anybody who wants to talk about public safety needs to understand that nobody is going to be safe if people don't have housing. They do what they need to do.  in order to find a place to stay. There aren't all night laundromats like there were when I was homeless, where I could stand behind a laundromat and stay warm underneath a vent. People are going to break into houses. They're going to do these things. I robbed a bank.  What do you think the likelihood of me doing something similar to that would be if I don't have housing? How am I supposed to put my life together if I don't have housing? I've been a resident of Lansing since 1983. And the only reason I have a place to stay right now is because my wife's name is on the lease. And every year when we renew our lease, they say, just stay on as a resident.  So these aren't just political issues. This isn't a political football. These are people's lives. This is everybody's life. This is not just somebody who made a mistake's life. This is everybody who's sitting up there who can be affected by this. We have to think bigger about these things. We have to think holistically about these things. And we have to think about people as people.  This is not just somebody who has been in prison. This is not just a parolee. This is a person who's been formerly incarcerated. So statistics are important, but so are stories. And think about that when you're voting on something like this.

I spent 35 years in prison and I came back to my hometown, Lansing. I've never seen so many deserted houses, red tags in my life in this city.  The last time I was in this room, Mayor Max Murningham was here. The situation is we have individuals coming out of prison who needs a chance, a fair chance. I watched as everybody turned to the United States flag and said, liberty and justice for all.  As we sit back and think about discriminating against the individuals who have felonies, should not we include, well, how about Jesus Christ? How about any of the people? Well, let's look at Paul, the individual who wrote a large percentage of the Bible. He was a murderer. So we can eliminate him.  But maybe we can also eliminate an individual who had 25 years in prison, Nelson Mandela. He was indeed a trouble causer. He was put in prison for causing trouble. Then four years out of prison, he was the president. Let us give people a fair chance. If I am wrong, it's easy to prove.  You members can go out, live in the streets for four days. You can't do it.

This time last year, I wrote an article that was published by the Lansing City Pulse. I wrote that article to warn you guys about the housing crisis in the city. In fact, I named the article, Lansing residents deserve safe homes. And in that article, I stated that lives are at stake. Six months after I wrote that article, a toddler died in the city.  a toddler who was living in a house that didn't pass inspection, that wasn't licensed. Fast forward to a couple months after that, we kept coming to the city, to you guys, to open up a 24-7 warming center, a place where people can come and feel warm and feel safe.  You guys said no. You guys, it's like talking to a wall whenever I come here. It's literally a waste of my time, quite frankly. The only reason why I come here is because I care about people. But talking to you guys is literally a waste of my time, because I know nothing is going to change. Just this past storm that we just had on the 23rd of December, a man and his dog died in a car due to carbon monoxide.  You bragged about Code Blue. What the hell does that even mean, Code Blue? Usually when a government declares an emergency, they set aside funding. They set aside help. They open up places. You just declared an emergency. If the governor declares an emergency, she can deploy the National Guard. She sets aside funding. When the president declares an emergency, he sends in FEMA.  You got to take action, Andy. You don't just declare it code blue, code yellow, code brown. It doesn't mean nothing. Literally, it means nothing. I looked at your code blue. It's literally a waste. One of the things that you had was it says, anyone in need of a place to go can walk. Walk. You guys all saw what was happening outside. Is that a condition? Anyone could walk in?  Walk? You couldn't even walk. None of you will be willing to walk. Forget walking, it was hard to drive. Yeah, I want people to walk. That was very inconsiderate. What you did wasn't enough.

And there'll be other speakers from the group Nation Outside regarding the Fair Chance Housing Ordinance that I know is under consideration or has been in the Ad Hoc Committee on Housing and Safety. And I'm here from Moms Demand Action to state our support  for that ordinance. And we think Moms Demand Action is a group that believes in common sense, gun legislation. I work with a program called Be Smart that tells people about common sense actions adults can take to help protect kids from gun violence. And we believe that the Fair Chance Housing Ordinance is just a common sense action that actually helps address gun violence.  And I just want to mention two facts why we believe that. One is that, and this is in a presentation that Nation Outside does, but 20 to 30 percent of homeless people experiencing homelessness have admitted to committing minor and major crimes in order to, you know, solve their own housing issues and get some shelter.  And we think it just makes really common sense to do whatever we can to remove the barriers to people who are formerly incarcerated before they become homeless, before they feel the need to commit violent acts or criminal acts. So we think that helps reduce gun violence.  And finally, 63% of landlords in a study have admitted that past criminal history is a factor in their denying tenancy, yet research cited by HUD indicates that past criminal history is not predictive of successful tenancy. Those two things, they don't jive. We just think it makes common sense  to remove the prejudice against people who are formerly incarcerated and give them a chance, you know, a fair and equal playing field with those that haven't been incarcerated, to have a chance at stable housing, thus giving them a chance at having stable employment, thus providing an atmosphere where we're less likely to have gun violence, we believe. People in stable housing and stable employment, we just think it makes a ton of sense.  So that's all I wanted to say. Thank you.",Homelessness

I'm here to speak on the need for a publicly owned 24-7 warming center in the city. As Mayor Schor hinted at in his remarks, we had the bomb cyclone that happened. And during that, I went out with my sign and my bell, and I stood out in front of City Hall trying to continue to raise awareness around this issue. And I was only able to stay out there for about an hour.  It was really cold. It was very windy. Holding the sign up was an upper body workout that I was not prepared for. And after about an hour, my cheeks were windburned, and I had to call it quits. And I guess standing out there, it was, and with the code blue, when I looked at the code blue, it felt like  go somewhere else. It felt like, let's just fall back on the existing nonprofits and the existing religious groups. We're going to fall back on them, and they'll save us. But those groups are not accountable to us in any way, even though they're taking over half of, not half, but a quarter of a million dollars from these ARPA funds.  And so the idea that we have these shelters that aren't accountable to the people, I think that's not a great idea. Um, and seeing city hall empty that day when, and then going home and seeing pictures on Facebook of people dying in the park, dying on the street. And we can say we did a great job on saving the people we did save, but that building was empty.  And you can't tell me that this building doesn't have the security that we need. Grand Ledge, as an outlying community, already has public warming centers. They already beat us to it. It's not a hard concept. I do want to spend the last seconds here.

And this is a known fascist dog whistle from the era of Benito Mussolini in Italy. Benito Mussolini was famously known for, not famously known, but myth, mythically known for having had the trains run on time. Well, at least the trains are running on time is, is a way of shorthand for austerity politics.  It's shorthand for supremacy politics. Thank you.",Homelessness

I want to mention two things that I think weren't brought up and that is it's not only people who do time in prison that have a record.

I'm here to talk about the homelessness issue. I would like to address to the ad hoc committee specifically, I'd be willing to work with anyone on that committee to be able to help out. I believe I have a unique perspective on being homeless because I was homeless here in the city for over seven and a half months. I've also worked in the homeless shelters to assist those that are homeless.  I don't know, did everyone get my one-page proposal? Thank you, I'm hoping. I hope I addressed that appropriately with you folks, but I would like to be able to ask if it's possible to be scheduled for the Committee of the Whole to be able to give you a full presentation with all the numbers and all the details ready to go. But I believe my unique perspective is building tiny houses in a tiny house community could be able to alleviate this problem.  I'm already currently worked on two other communities of tiny house communities in other states because there was an opportunity for me to be able to address this with them. I found out many times that those tiny house communities not only rose property values of the properties around them, but they also asked for inclusionary projects with their neighbors.  Their neighbors love to have them. I've talked with the chief police, chief of fire departments around those communities specifically, and they said that they've had nothing but good things to say about them. Neighborhood and Planning Committee, I am working with here in Lansing right now. I'm working with Andrew, and he has been able to be a good font of information. I went to one of their meetings, and I was able to address this to those members.  And I was able to touch them all. And they said that I should address this body to let you know that I actually have a good plan. But I'd like to be able to present that if I could in a full dissertation to give you all the facts, figures, numbers, and the individuals I've collected together to help me.

They're willing to give material.  to us to be able to do this. I've also talked to veterans, those that are in recovery, and those that are out here on our streets. They're all behind me wanting me to be able to do this project. Ladies and gentlemen, I really believe and I feel that I actually have a different take on being able to cure this problem. There are some that cannot live in tiny houses. That much I know and I've seen.  There is an assessment that I was dreaming up and being able to talk with those in mental health to the military to be able to screen our own veterans for this. I believe I actually have a working knowledge and a working plan that I was approved from the Battle Creek VA to be able to put it on their property. If they're willing to trust me, are you.

Appreciate your time this evening. I more or less just wanted to introduce myself Michael's and what Devon self-storage we represent the buyers that are trying to buy the property on 340 East Boulevard the gold Sam's Club We are we've been kind of going through the process with the city and look forward to the conversation that we're gonna have with you on the 13th and  We we've been trying to find common ground with We've had we've had both opposition and in favor of us being there. We've had some local neighbors that have Showed some concerns with us coming and we've we're trying and we were open to And hopefully you'll get a good sense that we want to be good neighbors And we're trying to find common ground that way so we can build our facility there  Having said that, we also know that there's other neighbors that are definitely for it and local businesses right next door that are definitely for us going there. And to just give you a small background on who we are, we're based out of Embryville. We've got about seven facilities in the state of Michigan, four of them in Grand Rapids, two in Holland and one in Jensen. And we're currently trying to build one in Warren and Southfield and hopefully here in Lansing.  We're a company that's well-experienced in the self-storage industry. I know it was mentioned that it's heavily saturated in self-storage. I would respectfully disagree. Part of our analysis when we go to look to purchase a building, and this is right around $6 million that we're looking to purchase the building plus the construction costs.  I call it the white car effect. If you go shopping for a car and your car is white, it seems like that's all you notice. But when we go into our analysis, we look at the population and the square footage in the market, and this puts it at about a 6, where national average is about a 10.  So it's definitely underserved, and that's why we're pursuing this. We're fully funded, so it's not something that we're going to start and not finish. It's usually on a 12-month time period that we look to get our start and finish with our construction. And it's not a typical self-storage facility that you may or may not think of.  It's a real class A facility. It's where you'll be able to drive your vehicle into the building totally out of the weather. It'll be completely climate controlled. It'll be first class security and facilities that are offered to the public. So look forward to our conversation more or less. Just wanted to introduce myself and and look forward to trying to find some common ground and a pathway forward. So thank you.",Economic Development

This is a screenshot I took off of a video from a body cam from 12-19-2018 as people were trying to break into my garage again. It was a bad year. So many losses I couldn't even count. So many attempts I couldn't even count. It got so bad that I set up yard alarms and cameras  And on this night, when he went off at 3 o'clock in the morning, we called 911. Ended up calling 911 three times over the course of about 20 minutes, telling them, all you got to do is block the alley. The vehicle's in the alley. The bad guys are in the alley. This guy was a lookout a block away. Instead, they drove by the alley, hit the alley with their searchlight to let them know that they were there.  And I drove around the corner on the Foster, seeing a guy walking, and decided to confront him. He happened to be a lookout that I picked up on my camera system also. When they chased him, he threw his backpack over the fence. It had a Tech-9 with .22 in the magazine and one sideways in the chamber.  It was good that they got a gun off the streets, but it'd been nicer if they got the gunman off the street because he's just going to go out and get another gun. Did they take fingerprints? Did they do DNA? Did he even try to take this picture and clean it up better than my cheap printer could do and put it out there, circulate it to find out who he is? Because he was connected with a large group that were doing a lot of break-ins in the neighborhood. He didn't mind quite often. I lost a lot.  Anyways, I've got this video along with my videos on a YouTube channel called Political Accountability in Lansing, Michigan. I hope everybody that's here will maybe look at it sometime and see how the police operate and what they did on this night and how they failed. It's political accountability because you mayor, you're the one that, you're their boss.  They only get away with this stuff because you let them get away with it. If you look at this, along with a lot of the other videos, and I've just begun, this is all on one playlist. And it's the only playlist I've got going so far. But I've got over 40 videos uploaded so far, with a lot more to go. And by the time I'm done, I'll have everything in playlists. But it's probably going to take me a year or so, because I work 50, 60 hours every week.  No chance of retiring. Too many losses. Too many losses because in this case, like in other cases, the police allowed the bad guys to get away.",Public Safety and Law Enforcement

This would allow the Board of Water and Light to have liens on families' homes here in Lansing. The problem with the lien is the families, and there are 17,000 families, by the way, according to Lansing State Journal, in any given year that suffer a shutoff.  one in every six people in the city. According to Yolanda Bennett, Board of Water and Light, the city charter, it allows Board of Water and Light to request that the city council, by ordinance, collect unpaid charges for Board of Water and Light electric services and enforce liens upon the family's properties.  The as I mentioned border water light has the draft ordinance they've added Well, it would amend the Lansing codified ordinances ordinances chapter 1050 adding sections 10 50.02 to 10 50.10 Creating a lean process for collecting to link a board of water and light charges Wait  According to this chapter 10 50.03 it also says and this is just a piece of it such lean shall become effective immediately upon the distribution or supplying of such electric services or services to such premises So does everyone's property automatically get? get  on a lien, and then it, whatever, I'll need the attorney's help here for the language. And then it just gets enacted. It just gets processed. If this comes to fruition, I've seen more families put out of their homes, low-income families, seniors. It would affect black families adversely at higher levels. They'd be more homeless.  and more frankly for the Ad Hoc Committee on Homelessness to deal with, there'd be more students in our schools that are homeless.  According to Harvard's Civil Rights, Civil Liberties Law Review, losing one's home is not the only possible consequence of failure to pay your electric bill. It can impact one's health, custody of children, and in severe cases, one's freedom. I'd like to offer an alternative, which Consumers Energy currently has a pilot.

I'm from the second war and I'm a candidate for Lansing City Council. I'm here representing decentralized Lansing. I am here to speak with several issues I have with the city.  Specifically, you all know my opinions on the at-large and why I think they need to be gotten rid of.  I mean, second, another problem is that of urban planning. One of the things that really pushed me over the edge and had me up to here with the Lansing City Council was that they pick and choose a lot of construction projects without looking into the records of the construction projects and how problematic they were, to say the least.  And it really pushed me over the edge. It's like, why aren't you looking into people's records before you actually vote on getting construction projects? And I'm going to tell this, quality is better than quantity. I'll tell you that much. People deserve more quality housing than more housing, because a lot of the new housing projects I've seen around my neighborhood  are just limited to small houses meant to fill in space without actually considering larger spaces that could fit more families. So that's one another major problem I have. Another problem is that because  half the at-large council members live in Ward 4. They tend to hog it up on all the construction projects most of the time. As I've seen through Moores River, which is where a lot of council members tend to live, a lot of that area tends to be more well-kept and I guess you could say has higher standards and higher costs of living. They tend to get more representation while we here in Old Everett and in other neighborhoods just don't.  And a lot of neighborhoods on the South side just don't have any neighborhood associations and also neighborhoods is hilariously underfunded. We seriously need to make several changes which is why I, one of the reasons I decided to run in the first place and why I decided to form Decentralized Lansing as well.

So the common issue today I'm hearing is housing, be it fair housing or not.  And unfortunately, as a newly elected school board member, I stand here and say I live in sub-par housing. You know, I work a full-time job. I have businesses that I do maintain. However, when we are up against things as bedbugs, rats, walking outside and you're falling, causing you to be hospitalized for 7 to 10 days,  and then you reach out to the mayor's office and you get past the buck, past the buck. So fair housing is for everybody and on top of that having to be experienced gun violence, yes as of December 31st my family became a victim of that but my neighbors had shot in the window while we're laying home. We are here to help each other and  Many of you, I voted for, I campaigned for, I've spoke to you, I've sent emails as far back as April of this year to Noah Vail that we are safe, we feel safe. I literally move my hair in my house and I jump because I don't feel safe. It's not, anything can fall down. Your inspections, every furnace in our complex, and I will say, Autumn Ridge is not up to code.  Three years since 2019 and nothing, everything keeps going down. I started out with five violations in 2019. As of today, my unit alone has 17. And because you guys are suing them, the people that live there have to suffer. Our rent is steady going up, but nothing else is getting done. Mayor Schor, I am really, really, really saddened because my teenager, at the time when you first voted,  got it, went out and campaigned and was invited to your inaugural, but had the flu. So my child is a reflection of what he believes in. And as I sit and watch, most of you have failed us as people, as individuals, some as friends. What are we going to do to fix this situation? Because  Again, as money and grants are coming in, we're only recycling it to the same organizations. We're not fixing the need. We're not creating some things that need to be there. Nobody's reached out to my family and said, how can we help you since your son has been shot? And Mayor Schor, yes, you've worked with my son. I'm not going to say his name, but he has things that you are going to be working together with. I am saddened that after all of this time and after all the things that we do and believe in,  Lansing is not what it was and not what it should be. Buildings are growing, but we have a lot of families that are suffering. When is the change going to come? You all have to look at each one of yourselves and say, am I doing my part? I'm doing all that I can being a school board member because I'm going in as a parent, not as a politician. What does your family look like? What are the dynamics in your home look like?

I look forward to telling my lawyer story. On the mission statement for the City Council, it says the City of Lansing mission is to ensure quality of life by promoting a vibrant, safe, healthy, and inclusive community that provides opportunity for personal and economic growth for residents, businesses, and visitors.  When I first encountered problems, I tried to contact my city council member in my ward. That was Jody Washington. I called her probably a dozen times, leaving voicemails. Never got one response. All I needed was some advice as to how I could deal with what was going on in my unsafe neighborhood. When I failed with her, I tried to contact Carol Wood.  I called her, I think, twice, and once again, no response. Called them both on their cell phones, left voicemails on them, never got a response. Election time, though, I get mailers from Jody Washington. In it, right off the bat, she's supported by and endorsed by the police officers.  wants to be supported by the police. In it, it says, Jody works for Safe Neighborhoods. I've never seen that. Carol, same thing, Capital Area Labor Program, Lansing Police Officers. On this one, Fraternal Order of Police Lodge 141. I don't blame you, I'd like to have their endorsements too. In it, you wrote,  Make sure your voices are being heard, that your opinions matter, whether it's a neighborhood issue, a public safety matter, or an economic development project. Nobody ever returned calls. But I got the same thing with the mayor's office when Bonnero was in office. City police chief, nobody ever returns calls. I used to tell my lawyer when they had a,  a dozen felonies against me and Sherry that I wasn't worried about anything because the truth will set me free. And it did, it set us free. In my case, more than once. I also told people all the time that if no one stands up, we all fall down. I know I'm on my own. And I know the city spent a lot of money, tens of thousands of dollars trying to convict me.  And if the deposition had happened at the city attorney's office, maybe we would have never had to go through this.

And I'm also a supporter of to have the fair housing. Okay. First of all, we have to look at, we have to give the ex-offenders, the proleagues, people with a background, a chance at success.  If they don't get housing, I don't call them apartments, I call them commando centers. This is where you do everything with your life. This is where you cook, you eat, you have your friends over. This is a commando center. So that's another way to look at the apartments. There's also a benefit I found that when you do accept ex-felons, that you're not just taking them, you're uniting families.  People, ex-offenders that haven't seen their kids in a long time, they now have a place to entertain their children, maybe even have them move in with them. And so seeing smiling children, girls and boys, that's a side effect of having fair housing.  And the one thing I wanted to say I think would be a very good approach is these people that are having difficulty, they need a caseworker. When someone has trouble with housing, why are evictions happening? They're happening because they don't have a support person. To be success in housing, if you're very mature, you need two people, the landlord and yourself. But people that have issues need the landlord, themselves,  And they also need case support, somebody that's out there speaking for them and helping them obey the, you know, I don't want to say obey the lease, go along with the lease and the three things that you mentioned. And I think if we, you know, put more effort in that, we're going to have more success.  The big thing with everything is why are evictions happening? They're not all monetary. Monetary, generally, we can get help with. But when it's behavioral things, we've got to have case support. If we don't get case support, then the next step is police. And we don't need to turn every situation into a police situation if we get the right support at the right time.  Let me see if there's anything else. I just want to say I've had several successes with ex-felons, people on parole. I just want to say I've had several successes and I've united some families. Thank you very much.",Homelessness

I taught for 43 years, and teaching is my heart.  So, I have volunteered at Northwest Initiative, Aero, as a GED teacher. And every day I meet returning citizens, male and female, who have a very difficult time adjusting to life in the real world because they have so many have to do things on their list and housing is number one.  They may have mom and dad or someone to live with, or they may have a couch.  that they can slam on for a while, but then that's not permanent. They have to move on. They may live in a shelter for a minute, but those get full awfully quick. I had one student who lived in a tent in the backyard of somebody's house. I had another student who, as an example, who kept getting in trouble and having,  trouble finding a place to live as being one of the main reasons why he was having difficulty. I also have a son who came home and felt like he had nothing with a whole lot of things he had to consider and do. And he came in and said, Mom, I might as well go back. There's nothing here for me.  I was downhearted and sad, and that's one reason why I am an advocate for the young people that I meet every day. Having home to live gives safer streets, in my opinion.  It helps with their feeling of self-safety so they don't have to carry guns and get in trouble. It helps with their self-confidence and builds their self-worth. And if they are homeless, it just tears them down. They come home wanting to be successful.  and are feeling knocked down and defeated from the very beginning. So I would encourage you to really look at fair chance housing for returning citizens. I tell my students, they are not felons anymore. They're returning citizens. Thank you.",Homelessness

My name is Specialist Robert Sherron, Army veteran. I was incarcerated for 18 and a half years. I've been home for four and a half years now. One of the obstacles I faced when I came home was housing. I came home suffering from PTSD. I didn't know what that was until I was diagnosed with it.  I came home and I was married, my wife was staying in this townhouse and little did we know that I couldn't be on the property because of my felony conviction. So for a year and a half, I had to sneak around the property, avoid management with my two kids because I was a felon. So lo and behold, thank goodness, by me being a veteran, I found out about my VA loan.  I had the income, and I had the credit. So a year and a half after getting out, I was able to purchase one of my dream homes. My plea to you all is this. I work with a veterans group over at the Lansing CBOC Clinic over on Cedar Street in Joplin. And we have a lot of returning veterans. And they're coming home with mental issues, serious mental issues. And they come home, and they do stuff that runs them afoul of the law.  due to unaddressed PTSD, depression, substance abuse. So a lot of them are in a predicament that I was in at one time where they can't get housing. And they're bitter about that. They're really bitter because they serve their country. They put their life on the line. Hey, some of them had just come home six months ago.  And untreated, you know, you come home and they, you know, just saw action, like two weeks ago, just saw their buddy, you know, their caravan blew up, and now they're back out here walking around, and they're trying to readjust the society. A lot of your road rage cases, a lot of your domestic violence cases, if you look at the data, are veterans. 23 veterans take their life every day.  So what I'm appealing to you all is the Fair Chance Housing is a step in the right direction because at least it gives a person the opportunity. When you check that box off that you're a felon, you know, you pay a $50 fee, your $50 is gone without even being, you know, without even having an interview. I have a friend right now that's a union member, worked at General Motors, makes $80,000 a year. He has a felony.  credit score, and he can't get an apartment. He's in the process of purchasing a home, but just think about the 80,000 credit score, and he can't purchase a home. That makes no sense. Fair chance housing, please. Thank you.",Homelessness

First, I want to thank Carol for your comment because the first thing on my list was to talk about progress on the hybrid meetings issue and whether, you know, we're starting the budget process again, if that was in the forefront of the budget planning. So I'm happy to hear that that is still being recognized as an important issue.  Second, I see there's quite a few, I think it was 12, maybe 13, things coming down the pike for sole source proposals for different products or services. And I don't have a lot of pro or con one way or the other with that except to say that I'm very aware that it's easy to write an RFP so that the person you want to get the bid has the only or the better chance of getting it. So I would just hope that you're looking at those  RFPs closely to see that they aren't written in such a way that it limits who can respond to them. Third, there was conversation during the first part of the meeting and in the CAO meeting about the finances and the financial reports and the fact that the finance department was going to be switching software soon and their deadlines that they had with the state that they were likely not going to meet.  And part of that delay was that they didn't want to invest in one software when they'd have to turn around and buy another. I see that the software they're talking about buying is one of those sole source amendments in the packet there. And that tells me that it's going to be a month, two months, three months before an approval even goes through for them to buy that, let alone convert to it. So it's really telling me that there's not much way  realistically thinking that they're going to meet those deadlines. And then lastly, there was conversation in the conversations with the new prosecuting attorney about guns in one form or another. And the comment was made that there could be people who were innocent of knowing what the law was and therefore they should be treated differently than others. So I just want to read you a quote  It is a fundamental legal principle in the U.S. that ignorance of the law is no defense. If ignorance were accepted as an excuse, any person charged with a criminal offense could claim ignorance to avoid the consequences. Laws apply to every person within the jurisdiction, whether they are known and understood or not. Thank you.",Governance and Civic Engagement

On January 3rd I was here before the City Council addressing this same issue. The right of every Lansing citizen  is a safe and affordable place to live. Not every citizen has this and especially returning citizens. Those who have been previously incarcerated are labeled and stigmatized as not worthy of a fair chance at housing in Lansing. Now is the time to reverse that problem for the city of Lansing. Returning citizens have paid their debt to us and deserve an equal consideration for housing as other citizens.  We know that safe and affordable housing gives a returning citizen a chance to make a new life and to be a contributing member of the community. I'm asking this city council to take action to pass a fair chance housing ordinance that last year's council did not do. In 2022, a draft ordinance was being developed and now needs to be addressed again.  It's up to each of you to become familiar with this and to make it a priority of the council this year. I and others will be keeping this need before you and will not give up or go away. So now is the time to step up and take the necessary action to work for returning citizens whose voice has been dismissed too long. Thank you.",Homelessness

I'm speaking on behalf of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, and adding our voice to support the group Nation Outside, which I believe you'll hear from a little more a little bit, in support of the Fair Chance Housing Ordinance. And we all value safe neighborhoods.  And one of the problems, preventing safe neighborhoods is housing insecurity, specifically for the formerly incarcerated, which we believe helps contribute to gun violence, a solution that we see.  For that, one of the solutions is the Fair Chance Housing Ordinance, which I know many of you have heard about before. Some may not be familiar. It is an ordinance that started with the Ad Hoc Committee on Housing and Resident Safety last year and is now with the Public Safety Committee.  So we're glad to see that it's still being considered and worked on. It's got four main points as proposed by Nation Outside. And those points simply are, number one, it prohibits landlords from asking potential tenants about their conviction history during the initial screening process. Number two, postpones any background checks until a conditional lease is offered.  Three, prevents landlords from unfairly denying applicants housing based on their criminal history unless that record would impact public safety, property, or other tenants adversely. And number four, allows tenants to offer evidence of rehabilitation prior to final denial by a landlord, you know, testimonials, letters, whatever.  What we're asking for, what Moms Demand Action is asking for, as well as Nation Outside, who I also work with, is simply that you give the Fair Chance Housing Ordinance the serious consideration that it deserves.  I know it might seem a little bit like it's indirectly relates to gun violence, but we think there's a real connection there. Housing insecurity, causing job insecurity, making it hard to have a job, you know, people especially formerly incarcerated not having a stable lifestyle, we can see where that can result in gun violence. So we're just asking that you give it your time and serious consideration, and we thank you for the efforts that you've already done on this. Thank you.",Homelessness

I would like to talk about a situation. 17 years ago, I got in a conflict with my partner and the prosecutor was determined to make an example of me. So,  He said that I was a felon, and for 17 years, I believed it. And I acted accordingly, trying to keep myself clean. I worked for Governor Granholm. I was an honor student. I was ported over to Governor Snyder, was an honor student, got three master's degrees, got out.  I wanted to be like everyone else, normal, have a relationship. So, the problem was I had the worst housing situation. Every time I applied, I was denied. You are a felon. You can't come here. We don't allow it. So, since I was in I would call a shack,  I decided I'm working for the governor. I can live, don't worry about it. Well, this weekend I decided to swallow my pride, go down to the fair, get rid of the felony. I go down there, I sit for about two hours, several asthma attacks,  And I go to the attorneys. They look through the paper. They're like, what are you doing here? I'm like trying to get rid of this felony. They're like, you don't have a felony. And I'm like, yes, I do. And they're like, no, you don't. So they send me off and say, hey, go and get yourself out. You have a misdemeanor for domestic violence. What did you do? I'm like got in an argument with my ex. And so they're like, well, you never had a felony.  Why are you here? And I said, I'm sorry for wasting your time. I walked off. And I'm like, OK. And they're like, go see those people. They are nation outside. I'm like, OK. I walk up to them. They're like, wait, for 17 years you believed you had a felony? And I'm like, yeah. Like, didn't apply for certain jobs that I got offered, ILM, return to Pixar.  go to work over at Dubai, and I'm like, I've wasted 17 years of my life living in shackles because I thought I had a felony. And I just recently applied for housing, was quickly denied, lost my fiance,  And she was like, I can't live here with you. So she left. So I would like the council to take note. Thank you.

I am actually going to repeat something I had said months before, but with a story to start it off.  This previous Saturday, I was walking to work as I do five days a week. And while I was crossing right next to Museum Drive, a driver decided not to wait for me in the crosswalk. They blare on their horn at me. I yell at them, hey, I'm in a crosswalk. And so they decided to follow me for a few blocks, yelling obscenities at me out the window. I call the police. He drives off. 20 minutes later, he comes back and swerves at me while I am on the sidewalk.  Two hours and 40 minutes later, the police show up and take my report. I am not blaming the police for this, as there are too many intersections for them to be policing every single one in the city. I am not even blaming that driver in particular, while his actions were definitely too much, because drivers always drive like that in the city.  Around the world and every city, like major city across this country, people have asked how can we make the roads safer? Can we educate drivers to be better drivers? Can we police the streets to make sure people are being safer? And time and time again, they say no. Drivers drive the way that feels most comfortable to them for how the road is set up.  All this information is gathered together in an idea called Complete Streets, which advocates for safer roads, which design the roads themselves to promote safer driving, safer pedestrian areas, and all that such. In 2009, when I was in fifth grade, Lansing passed the Complete Streets Ordinance advocating for Complete Streets in Lansing.  13, over 13 years later, this is happening. I am, every single day when I am walking, I promise you, every single day there is something. There is a driver parked on the crosswalk. There is someone turning right on a red light in front of me. There is people parked on the sidewalk. I have been pushed off the road by a pickup truck before while riding my bike. We are,  13 years after that, and if I walk around downtown, I would like one person, one person to point out a single significant thing that has actually happened to make it safer. Back when I was a kid, my parents used to talk about how downtown Lansing was dangerous at night because everything was run down, there's people everywhere. Walking home is when I feel safe because there are no cars. What are we going to do?  Thank you.",Transportation and Mobility

And the chip seal is atrocious. I listened to the response and I will say that if you came down my block,  Now it looks pretty good because the neighbors sweep it up. And like I said in front of my place, I got 15 gallons, 15 gallons of rocks. And this isn't just a contractor. This is on the City of Lansing Public Service. When I posted the video on the city site and on Facebook, this was the response. And Andy, I'd like you to listen to this. This was the response from your operator.  The road was chip sealed, straight grinder on the leaves, and they didn't have bodies to put someone in a sweeper. I was supposed to finish your route with Terry the next day in the sweeper behind me on days, but instead they put me in another route. So it's not just a question of the contractor not doing his due diligence. It's also a question of the public service department not coming back and finishing the job.  They're the ones that did this. They pushed all the leaves through the neighborhood, loosened everything up, loosened all that gravel up that wasn't loose. And then they didn't come back and finish the job by their own accord. And now for them to say, well, you're going to have to wait till spring, that doesn't work. The amount of gravel that is there is ridiculous. I mean, literally, if I swept my block, it would be pickup trucks full.  So Andy, you know where I'm at. Drive down through there and have a look at it. MLK, it's right down to the sealant. There's nothing there. You pull off MLK onto Cooper, you're right down to the epoxy. And I'd like to say also something about some things Andy said, that the catch basins are self-filtering. And that just sticks in my mind. I have no idea what that means as being in the public service department for 34 years. That's a ridiculous statement. And if it filters, where does it filter to?  Where is that gravel filtering to? I don't get that. It was a ridiculous statement. It was blowing smoke. And I would also say that as far as the sweeping goes and the catch basin cleaning, you said we don't get to it as often as we'd like to. Well, that's not the question. The question is, do you do it as often as you're paid to?  It's done through a fee. As you new council members will find out in budget, the compost fee that collects millions of dollars subsidizes sweeping, leaf pushing, and catch basin cleaning as well. So where's the money that we're paying if the job isn't being done? 117 bucks a lot, I believe. I got two lots. I want my fee, you know, I expect what I pay for.",Transportation and Mobility

Carol first, President Wood, I want to thank you so much for granting my request that the council have an ad hoc committee on homelessness. This is a problem that has gotten out of control.  The answers have never come. We keep doing the same thing over and over, and the population is growing. And in fact, it's not just our residents. We are now attracting homeless people. So this is a regional issue. It's not a Lansing issue. And we have to do something different. And I have full confidence that council will look outside of the box.  It was mentioned that the Lansing Housing Commission is coming before you for an audit I would have you know that this past week I have gotten notice from an apartment manager in this city where some of the people I advocate for live that they are all receiving eviction notices because Lansing Housing Commission has not paid their fair share of the rent for three months these are folks that have permanent supportive housing vouchers and  And their rent should be paid. It's bad enough we do not give them the supportive services that they are supposed to receive. Apparently that is a call once a week and they have them come down and get paper towels and toilet paper. This is not acceptable.  Triple J told me one time, in this city, homelessness is a cycle. We go from tent to shelter to apartment to eviction to tent. And the people you see on the street are not new homeless people. They have been housed. They have been evicted. And the cycle continues. So President Wood, I am looking for you to bring in people  that are not Advent House, Holy Cross, Lansing housing. There are so many people that have so many good ideas and are willing to actually help scaffold these individuals into independent living, not just handcuff them into these prisons of poverty that we continue to build with 4% pilots.  but to actually help them become sustaining citizens, which is actually what they all want. So we have to go beyond this building 5,000 units of low-income housing. We need to do more. We can't be the Mecca, but we can be the hope for those that we have here. So again, thank you so much. I will be at all of these meetings because people I love are suffering.  because of the inadequacies of the agencies that we continue to fund with my tax dollars and Everybody else's tax dollars. It's got to stop. So thank you very much with that I will say I'm incredibly optimistic with this Deus that I see and we will get it done. Thank you Thank you Thank you.",Homelessness

I am a licensed realtor and I own 50 rental properties in the city of Jackson. As a realtor, we are required to follow fair housing. And as a landlord, my husband and I have chosen to follow fair housing policies prior to the city of Jackson pass again.  As a landlord, you want tenants who are respectful. Do they respect your property? Do they respect you as a landlord? Are they respectful to their neighbors in the community that they live in? A background check doesn't allow me to find that out. We want people who are responsible.  Do they fill the application out completely? Do they provide the needed documentations? Do they answer questions and follow the policies and regulations in the lease? A background check doesn't do that. And finally, we want people who are able to pay. Do they have a job? Do they have a reference at work?  That is what is important as a landlord. And so Fair Chance Housing Acts would allow those criteria, which are most important to us as landlords, not a background check to determine whether I will place someone in my property and whether they'll be a successful tenant for me. As someone who has lived  In this world and worked in this policy for a long period of time, we have found it's a very successful indicator if they can meet those three criteria, and we don't do any background checks. We do have a number of tenants that have records. They have disclosed to us in the period of time that they lived with us, but that's not the issue if an issue arises. It's are they respectful, are they responsible, and do they have a job to pay the bills?  As such, landlord, I would advocate a fair housing policy for the city of Lansing would be successful just like it has been in Jackson, Indian Arbor and other communities. Thank you for your time.

I'm also a published author, an advocate, a mentor, I'm a counselor, and I'm so much more. I own multiple businesses.  currently still launching projects. I personally have worked extremely hard not to only change my life, but now I work even harder to change the life of others, to dismantle and disconnect the generational curses of incarceration and dead ends. I don't understand why we must continue to be locked and linked in with our past.  Housing security is the key to building stability and reconnecting with the community. People need an immediate housing plan in place. Without this, people will re-offend and be housed by any means necessary. The average formerly incarcerated individual is often restricted to pretty much everything. With these type of barriers in place, this makes it nearly impossible for people to integrate back into society.  If we're able to select a place in which we can migrate to after incarceration, this will be open doors for easier adaptability and rehabilitation. This will give us a chance to feel empowered with a sense of belonging and responsibility to not only establish endeavors, but also maintain endeavors.  This will be conducive to a healthy lifestyle, not only for us, but those around us. This will help us establish a chance, not only that the time that we spent behind bars didn't go to waste, but also that we've made changes and we're serious about establishing a life.  The formerly incarcerated also have children and families that we want to get things established for too. And that's pretty hard if we don't have a house or housing to do such things.  We really want to set a standard, like me personally, I want to set a standard for my son. He paid for my mistakes, and now I'm trying to change that, change his outlook. And it's really hard if I got, you know, a bunch of barriers stopping me and holding me back with housing. Oftentimes, like someone else said, housing is a place where you come, like, unwind and, you know, dismantle everything that you carry throughout the day and throughout life.  Without housing, how do we have a place to let all that go? Policymakers should prioritize housing security and resources for returning citizens. This ensures the decrease of recidivism. This gives people a sense of belonging. If someone is not feeling as if they belong, they won't act as such.

And so we have people coming up here and talking about the homeless,  And what the data shows is that when you look at homeless population, up to 50% of them  have criminal records, and there's a cycle that feeds upon itself. Once you experience homelessness, you're more likely to be arrested for petty crimes, and then you end up with another crime, you're incarcerated, you get out again, and now you can't get anywhere to live because we make it legal to discriminate against people because they made a mistake.

This past Thursday, I attended the meeting at the Foster Community Center from the Public Service Department about the redevelopment of Michigan Avenue. And the engineers there were answering questions, and I just had a lot of concerns that they absolutely did not help me with. Credit where credit's due. Just to start, I want to say that the bike lanes they're including with the redevelopment that are not in the street but up and against the sidewalk, that is great. That is something I was not expecting out of the city. It's something you'd see in like Chicago or even like Europe.  over the moon happy about that. That being said, there was just a lot of needless issues with it that I want to bring to the city council's attention.  To start off, for pedestrians, there is still only five crosswalks between Holmes and Howard Street, with four of those five being over 900 feet apart, the farthest being Foster to Howard, which is 1,680 feet between crosswalks. They were very happy to let us know that they increased the sidewalk on one side of the road by one foot from six feet to seven feet, which  just as a demonstration, is about as wide as this piece of paper, so congratulations for that, I suppose.  We asked them about leading pedestrian intervals at crosswalks. What that means is for the crosswalk, for about five seconds before the light turns green, the pedestrians get a green card to go. There's only one in the city of Lansing right now, which is actually right here at Michigan and Capitol. They said they didn't do any of them because they didn't. They had no reason. They just said they didn't put any in.  The New York Department of Transportation show that they can reduce killed or serious accidents for pedestrians by 29.6%. That is almost one third that can be reduced by just adjusting the timing of the lights and they just did not pursue it.  Finally, every single turn radius on the entire avenue that they're redoing is being set to a minimum of 20 feet, which is enough to accommodate a 56 foot semi truck at every single drive, every single turn that is being done.  when the recommended for an urban area is 10. I understand roads where you need trucks to get through, but for every single one, it has issues of increasing accidents by 16.2%, encouraging drivers to go blowing through stop signs and red lights, which is already a great issue on the avenue.  And actually, the morning of that meeting, at the corner of Green Lawn and Washington Avenue, a cyclist was hit and killed by a car with a turn radius of 20 feet by blowing through the light. I'd like to talk more about it with you guys if we get the chance, but this needs to be addressed.",Transportation and Mobility

I am a resident from the second ward.  I'm speaking here. I am actually reading off my notes right here that I have took throughout the meeting through a lot of problems I've been facing. Some silly problems like the name of that airport that was named after a very controversial U.S. president that I need not mention, considering his stance on unions.  Now, I want to speak specifically on that vacant space in the city of Lansing. I think it was an old Sam's Club or something, but it's neither here nor there. The fact that you're using it for a storage unit. And I've heard people defend it saying, oh, our economy's changed so much. What else are we supposed to do with it? Well, I'm like,  There's another thing you can use for it. You can use it as a warming center. Someone else actually mentioned that. There are many other things you can do in this day and age. And also another problem is someone mentioned that Lansing's roads are apparently good.  Well, I've actually rode the CATA bus down to the Southside a few times to Mr. Hussain's constituency contact meetings. I've been on President Grove Home, and it is bumpy. And it is not something I would call in good condition.  And it's clear that we need to really spend more on transportation. And also people are just evicted. I've heard on a regular basis from time to time. I mean, I'm sure rich people can make it into a drinking game out of their expensive French wines and.  Also, it was also mentioned by someone else that our city hasn't been the best in terms of pedestrian friendliness, considering that Washington and Greenlawn, in which, by the way, I live out there, so I should know,  has had a recent accident with a biker and a car, from what I've heard. And since I live around there and I tend to get on the bus for CATA right around there, that definitely personally affects me. And also,  The parking lot at Kroger is not very pedestrian friendly. I have to worry about being run over by a car. And potentially, if there are pedestrians walking through that, there could be lawsuits considering the deaths of family members. And we seriously need to make parking lots and other parts of the city way more pedestrian friendly. And we need to really solve this issue. And that's all I need to say. And I yield the rest of my time.",Transportation and Mobility

I wasn't going to say anything, but I want to say thank you, Mayor Schor, and to all of you council members that spoke against the self-storage unit. I am tired of these people coming up and telling us, I was mortified, nobody wants to do business with this demographic. Who do they think they are?  Nobody has a right to come in and denigrate any part of our city or our people. I get that the people trying to sell the land want their commission. I understand that. It's business for them. This is our home and we need to treat it as such. I think the demographics on the South Side are strong and good.  They are misrepresenting what we are, and they are misrepresenting what's going on in that parking lot. I'm by it all the time. I don't see the drinking, the drugging, the donuts, or anything else going on there. And I'm mortified that anybody would get up here and trash any part of our city the way that they have done. And yet, they want us to welcome them into our community? I think not.  I'm proud of our south side. I'm proud of the entire south side. And I think that area is one of the most engaged part of our community we have.  So when you have a hundred and some people showing up to an event saying no, thank you We need to listen. So thank you to each and every one of you. Thank you Mary mayor short for your comments I really really appreciate for you all standing up for us Maybe if there was something in there that provided jobs people wouldn't have to sit around and drink could could I stop you for a second?",Governance and Civic Engagement

That was inappropriate. I'm sorry. I just, I love our city. I love every part of our city and I don't like anybody coming in and talking about any of us like that. And I just really quickly wanted to say something about the homeless population. Everybody's talking about these 24 hour warming centers. That's not something that's needed year round.  That's something that's needed for a few months of the year. And I'm hoping through the ad hoc on homelessness that a good strategic plan will be in place. It should be done with the churches who will be on call, ready to open up, and ready to staff with volunteers. So this isn't something we need 12 months out of the year. So we have to be wise. But as we go forward talking about homelessness and shelters, we have a real problem with our transgender, our gay,  and are medically fragile homeless people. They are not safe in the shelters, and some of them aren't even accepted in the shelters. So as we go forward, please, let's remember that population also. Thank you.",Homelessness

I happened to have watched the morning news during Sunday on the 5th and hearing that there was gonna be a probation out in the East Lansing area at this home that's worth three quarters of a million dollars. These people who live in these apartments over there on Cesar E. Chavez and Seymour in the fourth ward,  They were interviewed with TV 6 and 47 both. They've got so much going on in those apartments, people with needles throwing them out in the hallways. Somebody up on the top floor wanted to change his door and put a new deadbolt lock. The owner would not allow him to do it. He texts that, you know, who's renting that apartment up on the top floor not to do it.  And he, the owner, or I mean, Juan Renton was willing to buy a door and a new deadbolt and put it in himself temporary until he leaves and put the original one back. But the owner still wouldn't let him do it, which I don't see no problem with that. You just don't want somebody breaking in his apartment during the middle of the night while he's, you know, maybe got a nighttime job. I don't blame him. Anyhow.  I just like to see something get done to get that, you know, I hate to see what happened over there in Sandy Allen's ward years ago when she was here on council on Orchard Court, they demolished some of those apartments. And I tell you, I went in there and I saw cockroaches. I saw a lot of stuff in there. I wouldn't even take no chance of living in a place like that. And  Also, talking about that old Sam's Club, I would like to see maybe another type of a store like they have on the west and the east side and out there in Charlotte, maybe a Walmart. I wouldn't want no darn storage unit. My God, look at Roller World over there on M.L. Kelly and Holmes Road. That's not a storage unit. That dealership they're on,  that same area. It's not a storage unit. Too many storage units. How about the old RV and store out there on Pennsylvania? That's a storage. You don't need no more darn storage units whatsoever.

I was at the planning board meeting when this was presented initially, and I can tell you that the planning board members at first refused to put the topic on the table. They were not going to even hear it.  And then, you know, they were persuaded by Susan Stasiewicz, if that's how you say her name, that they had to hear it, so then they did. But I'm not sure she was correct in the first place. But secondly, we have an example of having actually done the right thing, and that's with the city market, where we had a long-term delay in waiting for the right proposal to come along.  And finally, the right thing did come along, and now we have the shuffle. So, I mean, we have done it once. We can do it again. We don't have to succumb to that same mindset that says take the first thing that comes along because you're not going to get a better offer. That's garbage, just frankly. Third, the Ferguson family.  has a long history here of doing all kinds of developments. Mr. Ferguson's getting to a retirement age. Perhaps we could all sit down as a city, the mayor, myself, Mr. Ferguson, Chris, however you say his last name, and talk about them being the developers of a Ferguson family facility that would be a legacy that he would leave to the city in return for all the different developments he's profited from over all these years.  We have to look at things from a different standpoint. We have to start stopping.  Okay, you got to go through a broker to get to a realtor to get to a big-box store Look internally look at your resources you have here in the city who might be willing to step forward and do something like that and then lastly You know me I listen to the scanner. There's a little bit of vandalism. There's a little bit of drunken in the in the lot there It is not significant. It is not substantial. It is not something that's deterring people from going there being there working there  or wanting to work there. Thank you.",Urban Development

One of my wonderful roosters made it to the front page of the Detroit News. So I do know how to get my 15 minutes of fame. But one of the things that concerns me more than the Detroit News is the City Pulse. About 47 houses that are illegally occupied.  You know, I still am a lawyer, and I am very convinced that the problem is the civil rights violation. Occupancy is a fundamental right, and like freedom of speech, there should be a clear and present danger before a person is denied a fundamental right.  Red tagging, the reason why so many houses are red tagged is because safe homes are being red tagged. These red tag properties are safe. I'm living in one of them. I have two houses next to each other. I call it a house and a half because the one is really too small if you didn't have a, it's more like my office with my library.  You know, I feel that my civil rights were violated. I don't believe that my house should have ever been red-tagged. I haven't jumped through the hoops to say, oh, come back in and inspect. Do I think my house is safe? Yes. I believe my house is safe. There is no such thing as a 100% safe house, but you know what I think is really going on?  I think racketeering, and I'm going to bring this up to the county commission tomorrow because it's the county and the city together that are setting people up to fail, pushing houses into tax foreclosure as my house is threatened to be pushed into tax foreclosure by these red tag monitoring fees.  This is a serious civil rights violation. And there's court cases right now that say, hey, the county is going to have to exercise its fiduciary duty to the person whose house has been put into tax foreclosure.  I'm going to bring it up to the county tomorrow because I think they need to investigate this, especially since I believe there's one person who really set me up. Thank you.",Housing

You get the reference. Anyways, I first wanna thank the city council for voting against that useless self-storage unit at the old Sam's Club.  that would have been a disaster for that community. And it would have been completely useless. Because again, we already have four stealth storage unit, and we don't need a fifth.  And I would like to thank the city council for actually advocating for the South side's needs and that we don't, that saying that it's a completely useless area is just completely insulting. And, but I also want to speak about what we should fill certain vacancies on Edgewood for.  And for the old Sam's Club, I would be thinking maybe something like homeless shelter or something. But someone also spoke about the old Hooters nearby and the fact that it has not been filled in. I have a suggestion for what restaurant should fill that old place in. And that is Chicken Shack. It is a local restaurant.  chicken, fried chicken restaurant to the state of Michigan. I've been there so many times, several occasions, all consistently good.  And I think that would be a great place to do it, since Hooters actually also specializes in chicken as well. And plus, it would also be an upgrade, because Chicken Jack doesn't openly objectify against women, so that's a plus. So that would be my suggestion for what should be done.

Council Member,  Spitzley, Council Member Spadafore and Mayor Schor. I'm just really happy to be in this city. I absolutely love living here and I know we have an ad hoc committee for the homeless that's starting up and everything.  It's just there's just really a lot of opportunity of people coming together without funds and just just just loving on the homeless. It's just happening at Rudder Park. It happens different parks and areas and you know City Rescue Mission getting donations to to regularly reach out to the needy and Holy Cross upping their standards.  I'm around the police security, local, state, federal, around the capital area, and the homeless, and mental health. And I just think we have a very, very inclusive city, a city that really cares about the needy. And I love to be here.  And also we have Lansing Community College, we have the Cesar Chavez Learning Center, which is just incredible. You know, me on disability, I got a scholarship and I'm going back to college studying criminal justice. And I'm glad to be here with around all you guys, everybody who came out, Loretta Stanaway speaking up all the time, just people who just have had a long-term investment in this city.  and show that they care and they're here to make this city the best it can be. One small concern I have is the Lansing Center, it's just a lot of times it feels like we start up new projects, new things like they did a little bit of laser light show or something between the hotel and the Lansing Center, but then you're walking around the corner and you're like, wait,  it feels like a third world country on this side of the building and then on this side of the building it looks all new and shiny. I just think there's a lot of inconsistency in how it all is developed together and it's just it's the image you know the Lansing Center is a great image a welcoming image to the city is what we want it to be and it's just it's just not consistently a great presentation so  I know they're making efforts, but it just seems like certain parts of it have just been under construction for way too much time. They put up a sign and say, OK, this part of the river trail is just closed down. And so then I would do my daily walk on the river trail. And I'd walk. I'd go past that sign and find out that I could still walk on it a little bit. But then I get to one spot and be like, wait, there's no boards here. I better not walk on that part of the Do Not Cross area.  I think that we could really do that, Mayor Schor. It's really like, just take on that Lansing Center area, or the Riverwalk, and just keep doing the wonderful efforts we are to beautify. Thank you. Thank you.

It says, stop landlord abuse. 318 West Cesar Chavez Avenue is a poorly maintained apartment complex in Old Town owned by landlord Todd Dowrick.  of that township who owns over 100 other properties in Lansing. Tenants of 318 West Caesar Chavez Avenue have experienced bedbugs, cockroaches, holes, mice, electrical hazards, and the buildings  unreliable boiler heating for years now. Less than a year ago, WLNS 6 News did a story about the conditions of 318 West Caesars Chavez Avenue, interviewing residents and observing  First hand, holes in the ceiling of a closet, in the wall behind a bathtub, loose wires in the basement and bugs in a refrigerator. Many of the residents interviewed in that story have since moved on and conditions have not been improved. And I gave you those pictures here. Have you been over there to check it out? Jackson?  It's your award, and you four at large. I'm sure it's, you know, you're in charge of all four awards. But anyhow, something...  I also like to let you know, see the door, the dead bolt lock on the door, see that hole in the ceiling where bugs in, it could be termites too, to my opinion, but like they say here, who were handing them out a hundred properties. I don't know if he owns that many properties in the city of Lansing, but anyhow, I like to also let you know, I'm glad you guys, you know, turned that down that you voted on those,  storage units because with it, City of Blansing's got seven on the south side and they do not need number eight. Like I said before, you have the Roller World out there on Holmes and MLK. You got that Kmart, which is now a storage unit. You got the U-Haul, they're on the corner of Cedar and Jolly.

In my past, matter of fact, in two of my past addresses, I've spoke about the need to do something about the mental health that's going on in the city of Lansing. Unfortunately, my words came true in Michigan State. I feel that maybe it's time that we start  the city of Lansing, petitioning the federal government for assistance. The situation in Michigan State is absolute evidence that something is needed. There's time for emergency grants. Other people are talking about these issues and something needs to be done about them. In addition to that, it seems that the issue of homelessness and lack of places to live  for returning citizens is simply being ignored. As we all know, especially Mr. Jackson, I would assume, that psychiatrists have studies that addresses stress points. Homelessness is one of the super high issues. These things push people to levels unbearable.  As I've stated before, I know none of you have slept under a bridge. Very few of you have probably even thought of the idea of homelessness. It's time that we started addressing beyond the corridors of our own mind. This is what the city council is for, for the development of a city.  It's movement into a more powerful city, a concrete city, a good place to live. The situation at East Lansing hurt me to my heart. I also ask that we move forth on the bill to start addressing the issue of homelessness in Lansing. And that we start thinking about what are we going to do  about the mental health before summer comes. Everything increases with summertime, and this is something we need to plan ahead for. Before I go, I'd like to compliment you because I've heard on the news that  People from the city is looking into the 710 red tag houses. I'd like to compliment you on the heating facilities to help us so the people are not frozen to death, but we need to move forward strongly.

But my name is Nicholas Andy, candidate for Lane City Council and register of the second ward from the old Everett neighborhood.  And as a resident of the South Side, I feel it is my duty to speak about the vacant properties on Edgewood Boulevard. Now, my best hope is we don't bring up that self-storage facility nonsense that plagued many past council meetings, despite the fact that most council members and city residents, myself included, made it clear that we didn't want it and we didn't need it.  But it still definitely needs to be filled in and not get neglected for eternity or face being demolished. And we should consider other options for the vacant property, such as a sporting arena or something, since I believe it might be big enough for something like that.  And the old Hooters that was vacated a few years ago. I've said this again and again, but it should be used for another restaurant, something like, I don't know, Chicken Shack or something. And the old Sam's Club should not be used for something completely useless like self-storage.  because the South side of Lansing deserves better than being neglected and mistreated, which is one of the main reasons I support opening up the city charter this November.

The Elliot Larson Act that just got a new boost is great. It's a great thing. I appreciated that. Although I had to watch the emperor with no clothes continue, and I'm talking directly to you, Andy, continue to present that on his Facebook as if he was extremely happy about that. You know, it's good. You can be happy about that. I'm just saying you're not. My only question is when Elliot Larson is violated, what do we do about it? Because you've been found guilty of the Elliot Larson Act.  You, personally, October 6th, the jury came back and found the city of Lansing guilty. What do you do about it? So why would you want more laws in place that you can't abide by directly? You owe me $1 million right now. You're fighting every way you can, you and Smirka, with every legal maneuver that you can make to not hold accountability for yourself.  That's the emperor with no clothes. And the problem is with the city council, and this is the problem I have with you all, is that I know that you all see me. I asked that question. I ask you now. Do you see me? Do you hear me? I've been here for two years, three years now, explaining these issues, explaining what I went through. I've brought other people here. You have a firefighter, a fire chief, and Chief Odom, who's come here and expressed to you his own circumstances in the fire department as he sits now today, and had a case against this man and his administration.  And we just act like this is not, this is like, and then when I see the Elliot Larson act being, things being added to it and the celebration coming from this man that's been found guilty of it, your office was found guilty of it. That's the emperor with no clothes because nobody is sitting him down and telling him to his face. If it walks like a duck and it quacks like a duck, it's a duck.  So it doesn't matter how many elite black people you get into your organization that are not directed to or here because they're trying to break down racist systems, but more trying to better their position inside of it. It doesn't change the facts that you are what you are, a duck.  I will be here every, let me stop, I'll be here every week to do this also, until you're gone. But the ember will not close also comes into mind when I just seen you say that you're going to go run for Congress and that you're putting a community together to acknowledge that. And I want to say this about it. I don't truly believe that you believe you can win that seat. What I do believe is that you're going to siphon dollars out of this community.  to figure out how else you can put that into whatever next position you want to get. And once you figure out, once you come to the term that I can't win this position, you're just going to say, you know what, I love Lansing too much. And here comes another lie to the people that you care anything about the city. Five years I've been saying your whole, your whole idea was to move on past the city. So you're leaving us with all types of BS that we can't deal with because you don't care what the city looks like two years from now. You have no plans on being here.  Eight seconds left, I don't got enough to lambast you. I'll be here every two weeks to do that.

As an active and concerned citizen of Ward 2, I'm here again before you to request the City Council pass a fair chance housing ordinance. This will provide the formerly incarcerated an actual chance at housing in Lansing.  Research has shown that a criminal record is not an effective measure for landlords to find good tenants. In fact, using that arbitrary measure without appropriate consideration eliminates people who will work at being good tenants. We also know that stable housing for the formerly incarcerated is good policy for communities in the state of Michigan. It reduces a return to incarceration.  A right of every Lansing resident is a safe and affordable place to live. Returning citizens have too many arbitrary barriers held against them when released. Those who have been previously incarcerated are labeled and stigmatized as not worthy of a fair chance at housing in Lansing. Now is the time to reverse the problem for the city of Lansing.  In Michigan, these other communities have passed a fair chance housing ordinance. Detroit, Ann Arbor, Kalamazoo, Jackson. How come as a capital city of Michigan, Lansing is lagging behind and not taking the lead? Change is needed, not status quo, no more review and discussion about a fair chance housing ordinance.  I'm asking this city council to take action to pass a fair chance housing ordinance. I've been told by city council members that the city attorney is still reviewing a draft ordinance. It is time to move and require the city attorney to complete his part so the ordinance can be introduced for passage.",Housing

And I will say that I love the way  Mayor Schor was when he was running for the legislature because I worked on his campaign, but it feels like somebody bought and sold him because he's just all about economic development now and nothing about the citizens. I'm sorry about that. You may or may not know that I serve on the ALPAC, Allies and Leaders for Police and Community Trust, and I passionately want police to be trustworthy.  And I see an evolution, thanks to Chief Sosebee. Half of the Lansing police force has been trained in the Memphis model of crisis intervention team training, where they learn how to calm themselves and assess a situation for themselves, not necessarily what a racist citizen reported to the dispatcher.  And that's a wonderful, wonderful thing. We're finding that even a SWAT team member who saw a CIT-trained officer deal with the situation said, wow, I couldn't have handled it that well myself. And a guy who was hiding out because there was a warrant for his arrest called the non-emergency number and asked for a CIT-trained officer to pick him up because he knew he'd be treated with respect and courtesy and given options for treatment because his crisis was  something that could be dealt with by something other than jail. And we have special courts for that too. So they learn about all these options and all the organizations like the Village and the Fledge and so on who do so much good. So I heard that there was a new training and there were more police officers trained and they say first responders in the capital area so I don't know  how well SOSAB is doing to reach its goal of 100% of the Lansing police force. And I don't know if the EMTs like Mike Lynn that we don't have nearly enough of in the fire department are also taking CIT training, but I think that would be wonderful.  So just congratulations on that wonderful progress in the city of Lansing, because I believe there's a smidgen of hope out there that maybe citizens will have reason to begin to trust that maybe the police officer who intervenes with a crisis is gonna treat them with respect and courtesy.  I think the word's getting around in the capital area in general. And when it happens in Lansing, I'll feel like we're making progress on the LPACT. Thank you.",Police Reform

Real quick, I do want to voice support for Nation Outside and the efforts they came here to talk about. What Tony Gantt voiced about the systemic nature when it comes to racism being involved in their efforts, that's a perfect segue into what I came here to talk to you all about. I want to acknowledge, and it's really important that this is heard with open ears and receptivity because it is the truth.  Racism remains the most accepted form of oppression in our society. That is fact. It is consistently the form of discrimination that never receives the level of urgency, resources, and commitment to address the problems with the people affected. We see this time and time again when we have people continuing to ask for action and not conversation.  This is largely because it permeates every crevice of our society. So addressing these issues requires more than just surface level changes. And that is the status quo, surface level. It requires digging deeper, systemic change, lots of time, lots of resources, lots of money. But instead, we get resolutions. We get committees that talk about racism and discrimination. On June 22nd, you all passed a resolution declaring racism as a public health crisis.  That was a major thing at the time. Across the countries, we see people, groups, individuals, politicians, governments, not acknowledge racism and its effects, downplaying its existence. And somehow you all think that you're different and even better, but you're not. Your silence and your refusal to find the will and find the way to acknowledge our city's issues with racism, discrimination, and retaliation is you downplaying racism and denying its existence.  This administration is directly responsible. Your administration, Andy Schor, is directly responsible for the very real harm that is done to people in our community, people that I deeply care about. This council continues to overlook all of it. Even if that resolution was a carbon copy of the county's, it is still your words. It's your commitment. And it stated, we as a governmental body have a responsibility to ensure an optimal quality of life for all of our black Lansing residents.  So when the city of Lansing was found guilty by a jury of 12 of creating a hostile work environment based on race this past October, do you genuinely feel that you're living up to that responsibility? As elected officials, you do have a responsibility to use your platform, your voice, and every resource available to acknowledge the issues and the harm that has been done and to support the victims in this situation.  You need to know that moving forward without addressing the harm already done perpetuates systemic racism. So that means that you are a part of the problem. The DOJ has now come in and now is imposing. Is that what it takes, being forced? That doesn't sound like the commitment to diversity, equity, inclusion that rolls off of your tongues so easily.",Governance and Civic Engagement

I'm excited and if you guys will learn anything about me,  I just don't give up. Right. I refuse to quit, especially when it's something so important. And I'm back before you again to urge you guys to take seriously, uh, introducing a ordinance around fair chance housing for the city of Lansing recently.  The state of Michigan just amended Elliot Larson to add a whole group of people as a protected class. I commend that, right? That's important. But still in this state and in many cities in this state, it's still legal to discriminate against people with criminal records. Why is this a problem? Because a lot of people with criminal records look like me.  right so it's an end run around and many of you know this is a run around to protect the class so because felony records are so highly  distributed in the African-American community. We are now discriminating against people with criminal records that a lot of them are African-Americans. One in three African-American men have a felony conviction, but bigger than that because we want to punish them for the rest of their life. But what you got to understand, you're not just punishing them. I have a five-year-old.  So when you're punishing me by not giving me a job, not allowing me housing, you're punishing a five-year-old that did nothing. I know y'all don't really care, because I can see some of y'all face, but this is generational harm, right? This five-year-old that did nothing has a three times more than black boys, three times more chance going to prison because I was incarcerated.  Not because my five-year-old is inherently a criminal. That's not why. Because experts know that I'm going to struggle for the rest of my life with a criminal record to get housing, to get employment, to get a college education. You even bar people from getting into some colleges, right? You're causing generational harm. And then you decry what you see in the street. That's hypocrisy.  Thank you.

I find it just disgustingly appalling that he would have to receive a letter like that from the city, that it is threatening. It is extremely aggressive, and it's wholeheartedly unnecessary. If you remember, we came here with the People's Council of Lansing in solidarity with many other organizations. We staged protests. We did petitions. The city, the community, your community wants a 24-hour warming center. It is long overdue. We understand that.  We wanted to avoid people dying. So my gosh, Jerry had this.  audacity and the graciousness in his heart to open up his doors to keep people alive. I remember standing here saying, we don't want anyone to die. So he took action, and now he's going to be punished and threatened for that. This is what I meant earlier when I talked about the vein of democracy and what that's supposed to look like. You don't send a letter to a person like Jerry. You don't sit in back rooms with people  Smearing people's names people like me people like my husband people like Jerry That the village's mission statement has nothing to do with basic needs and harm reduction and things like that Yes, we do it through that lens, but it's not food. It's not clothing. It's none of those things just like it's not for Jerry, but yet here we are and why is that and  because constantly basic needs are not met in our city. Our community is hurting, harmed. People cannot meet their own basic needs. And instead of figuring out a way to make sure that Jerry can continue to do his work, that's what he gets out of it.  Come on. Then we get a resolution with eight community funding projects. Let me tell you, I know a little something about community funding projects and those specific appropriations from Slotkin's office. That is untrue. There were no specific guidelines. And if you know me, you know, I speak truth and I come with receipts.  All you had to do to initially apply was a one-pager. And all that one-pager asked you is to make the case for your project. That's it. If they wanted to give you feedback, if they had other questions, they would ask you. Trust me, I know.  So if you made the case, and a lot of that case had to do with letters of support from the community, all I heard was, we're going to backfill for things that we don't have the money for because I don't know how to take care of our financial health in this city. That's all I heard. Don't we have budget line items for those things, for infrastructure, for city operations, for public safety?  Where does that money go that we're constantly seeking grant funds for that, ARPA funds for that? It's not okay.

The jury found you all guilty. And that's still not been talked about. Nobody up here is talking about it. I don't know if the city attorney has told you guys can't speak on these matters. You can speak on these matters. It's done. It's over with. It's over. It's done. So they can throw as many motions as they want to this. But what are you guys doing to fix the issue?

I had a job where I risked my life for this city. What have you done? You tried to leave us two weeks ago.

The media won't talk about what's going on in the city, which made me have to create something just to tell the damn truth.  Just to tell the truth about what you should be caring about, fixing the problems, not your image. That's all you care about is fixing your image. In the Federal Department of Justice, they're coming here to put you guys under mandates. I've heard nothing about that in here. The HR department is under mandates right now because of discrimination and retaliation. The same things that got me fired, retaliation.  Because I had the audacity to say that I was discriminated against. I didn't know who you were prior to that. You took it upon yourself, just like you told this whole council here, to put the whole weight of the city on me. And that's what you did. And I prevailed. I got through. Don't cause no more harm to these landlords. Just do your job.  Do your job. You red tag them if they don't get it right and move them up out of there. Condemn the places. That's what your job is.

Three questions that has yet to be answered. And the sad thing is a toddler died. A toddler died in this city because you guys have failed to hold these people accountable. It's not the landlords that are putting these residents in danger. It's your department, Andy, the code enforcement, a department that we pay taxes to keep and operate.

Oh, how I wish that were true. I've,  Living on the South Side and going to neighborhood meetings across the South Side community, they have told me that roads there are terrible. And also, I've seen roads there. They're awful. Going on the Catabus down Pleasant Grove,  Road is bumpy AF same thing with Lions Road in fact Just running through there. I've been noticing many cracks in the street and many potholes and  and the city isn't really doing anything about it. And the excuses I've been seeing from those meetings confirms my suspicion that the city doesn't truly care for the South side, even though they've held the city there. Oh, and speaking of that, they've been saying that they're talking about increased funds of this neighborhoods department. Those haven't really gotten into action. It's still the least funded apartment and some houses in,  And that in many neighborhoods and many other properties have been red tagged as unsafe to live in. And considering that many landlords own those properties, it kind of makes sense that why both capitalist Adam Smith and communist Karl Marx have quite the disdain for landlords. And all I ask is that the city addresses these issues.  And as the governor said, fixes the darn roads and funds the gosh darn neighborhoods. And that we actually open up our city charter to give a voice to the voiceless in some of those neighborhoods who don't even have neighborhoods associations on the South side. So it's another issue.

I want to start by saying that the FLEDGE is a radically inclusive ideation and makerspace incubator and accelerator with a mission to create opportunity to pursue happiness.  There is nothing in there about food insecurity, about harm reduction, about being a warming shelter, about trying to provide transportation, about trying to provide technology for people, for getting involved in housing.  Nothing in our original mission had anything to do with that, but we come to this city where 40-some percent of us live below the LS threshold, another 20 percent of us live below the poverty line, 65 percent of us do not have the means to meet our basic needs, and we're sitting up here  sending me a letter, a threatening letter, saying legal action, trying to instill fear in me, saying I'm putting people in harm.

And these chip seal areas, everything that wasn't locked down from the freeze thaw,  has absolutely came loose. It's twice as bad as it ever was. Went to my chiropractor out in East Lansing the other day and he brought it up to me because they did the same thing in Meridian Township out in Okemos. He asked me how I came out on it and I said it's still kind of an ongoing issue. He said it's so bad out there, they had a township meeting and they're gonna black top everything that this company chip sealed out there  just because of the absolute disastrous job they did. It's destruction of public property in millions, in the millions of dollars throughout this city. Brian, you need to come out and look at this area in the 4th Ward. You gotta see this. With the big rain, it's all washed into the catch basins, they're full, the intersections are now flooding when it rains.  I mean, this is ridiculous. We're talking millions of dollars. I got a copy of the PowerPoint, how much every area costs. This is ridiculous. It's got to be made right. And what is the cleanup going to cost the Public Service Department? These streets are going to have to be swept curb to curb. Every area that was chipped, curb to curb, not just down the gutter pan and they're out of there.  It's going to have to be cleaned up. What is that going to cost public service in their limited budget? And, you know, like I asked you, well, just give them the money and they'll decide how they spend it. They'll let you know. They'll let you know where it's going. Well, you got three sweepers. They're all up and operating. They need to be prioritized on these areas, just like Andy said they would be.

It's just an excellent, excellent place. You know, for the last four years I've been there and it's just really a solid place that has helped my mental health and anybody can come in on Wednesday for a free meal and  It's just a great resource that anybody can come to. So it's 5.30 prayer and worship, 6.30 fellowship meal, 6.45 group time. They're welcoming and I'm just seeing people just come in, you know, everybody off the street homeless.  you know people who are vulnerable that you know it just it's a welcoming place and any of you mayor shore and uh council member jackson council member cost learning to pronounce your name now council member hussein council member carver's council member wood chris swope council member brown council member spitzley council member spadafore i'm very happy that you are all here working so hard for the city uh you deal with like the little details that i don't have the patience for but uh  I just come here to support you and thank you for today.

I live on Jennison, which is just down the street from the intersection where I've written my letter about, which is at North Jennison and West Saginaw, which is where the fire station is that perhaps some of you are familiar with. Without very much notice a few weeks ago, they changed that regular signal to a blinking yellow light going down Saginaw and a blinking red light going across Jennison.  Major consternation in the neighborhood. I had posted some information about this on our neighborhood Facebook page and I've done sort of an informal Tally of the comments and there are people who do like it I will tell you that they don't have to wait for the light anymore before they zoom across Jennison But it's about three and a half to one Against the change. We had a fatality there a week ago Sunday from a motorcycle going Galilee only knows how fast and  I hazard to guess, I happen to do one of my walks and I go in a westerly direction down Saginaw, so I'm facing the traffic, and as I said in my letter, I'm no speed expert, but I do think that they are going upwards of 70 miles an hour. It's insane.  People that are living on the edge of the neighborhood up against Saginaw when they're trying to turn right onto Saginaw are finding it very dangerous to do so because the traffic is going so quickly. And trying to cross from across Jennison and cross Saginaw is also a very dastardly attempt because of not only the speed of the vehicles coming down Saginaw, but there are so many impediments to vision.  The excuse or explanation from MDOT is ludicrous at best. One was that the people that are crossing with the light had a false sense of security. This is actually in writing in an email from MDOT when they are following the law and crossing with the light that they had a false sense of security that they wouldn't be t-boned by traffic coming down Saginaw.  And the other excuse or explanation for the change and why the old light isn't warranted is that there were so many rear-end crashes as cars were proceeding so quickly down the Saginaw.  So, we need a better police presence, for starters, to be dealing with the traffic patterns. We have a lot of schools. We have three schools and a daycare. St. Lawrence is right there, which is now whatever. Sparrow, I get so confused with all the changing pieces. But there's still people from our neighborhood that are walking over to the hospital, and they need to be able to access the north side of Saginaw.  And I would just hope that I know that your input is somewhat limited because it's an MDOT issue, but I'm glad it's in member Hussain's committee and that we get some good talking going with the state before they make this change permanent. Thank you.",Transportation and Mobility
LS_04_10_23,LS,"Lansing, MI",2023-04-10,2023-04-01,Training,Public Comment,Commenter,5263.0,5450.0,"Good evening, Council President Wood and members of council. I'm Deborah Mulcahy and I wish to share, following up to what Mary Rosenberg has shared with you, my concerns in regard to this light change. This is not a new light. My more senior neighbors tell me that the light is older than me. That's old.  Jennison is a north street that runs through the west side of Lansing and it's approximately two miles in length. MDOT is evaluating that light and lights on West Saginaw from Verlinden to Forest. When I first learned of the change, I didn't know if it was a good or bad change. I'm not a big fan of lights and signals and signs any more than necessary.  However, what I did learn and have learned through the research I've been able to do is I now can say unequivocally, I do not support the change that has occurred. I support it going back to the way it was, green, yellow, and red.  It has been very difficult to say the least to obtain information from MDOT. And in response to why were we as neighbors not told of this change, I was told, well, the city of Lansing met with us. Well, the city of Lansing never conveyed this to neighbors. And it was in a newspaper, one of those legal notices. We all know how hard those are to read. The fact of the matter is that  This, as Mary shared, the details of what was said was done in an email to us as to why this light needed to be changed. But this is what I'd like to read to you. And this is in quotes from MDOT. Both crash trends are common with what would be expected at an intersection where the signal is present, but not warranted. With the disadvantage of signalized intersection outweigh the benefits of signalization. Believe me, their logic  It defies logic. I have reviewed every UD10 crash report from 1-1-2004 to 12-31-2021. They're all available on the MSP site. Every single one of them. There were a couple that were missing per accidents.  It was not until, Mary mentioned, the death of somebody a week ago that there had been a fatality near North Jennison and West Merlin at West Saginaw. I haven't seen the UD-10 from the motorcycle accident, so I don't know what caused that.  In consultation with MDOT representatives, I learned that MDOT must conduct a 90-day study before making any light change. 90 days. So we're all assuming they've done their 90-day study. Based on FOIA data that has been provided to us, no studies or reports have been generated, but instead we have data showing one day in 2017 and four days in 2020.  What were you guys doing in 2020 in November? COVID. Do you think that's reflective of what we had? It's not. So I would ask that you, because you are allowed to participate in this decision, participate with the state of Michigan. Thank you.",Transportation and Mobility

I  About a week ago, I watched HRCS with this red tag mention how no one is turned away from hotels. A few days later, an older lady named Tanya came into the store, 59 years old, with colon cancer. She had called every agency to try to get housing. She got denied.  My mom cried at her feet. I made a public video. Five minutes later, Kim Coleman called my mom. This is why the agencies call me dangerous. Because I put human life before reputation.  Sadly, she died on Sunday in a warm bed because we argued to keep her there. Other things that make me angry. In 2013, I started the first community-funded hotel program that cost the city $0 from 2013 to 2017. This is an agreement that says that Holy Cross pays homeless angels $48 a night. This makes me sick. This was free for years.  But it's also signed by Sharon Dade in 2017 as a Holy Cross director. Holy Cross didn't come to Lansing in 2017. These are the kinds of wastes that I find. But the further I dig, like this Rent Smart program hosted by Joe McDonald, he's on the list of the landlords that are available to serve to the homeless population. So is Amber Paxton.  Bri DeBong. These are people that used to work for the city and directly had access to people's HMIS data. I said this time and time again, I've met with you before, Andy, about HMIS data with two Cooley Law attorneys that said, this is vital. It's federally mandated. I bring and present to the ad hoc council timeless copies of people's HMIS data that is blank.  Blank. One lady spent $26,000 of our taxpayer money in a hotel and it wasn't even on the documents. She couldn't qualify for federal housing because it wasn't there. The other thing that really gets me going.  is we spend so much money for families in hotels. Just two of them at the Causeway Bay Hotel. Nine months they've been there. $120,000 it's cost our community. I used to do this for $8,000 a person with zero cost to the city or agencies. It breaks my heart to see these agreements, to see these programs that are set up by people that we're supposed to trust and they put themselves  out there so that they can profit. We have to do better. There's ways to save money, but we have to put human life ahead of profit. We have to, and this is now. I appreciate your time. Thank you.",Homelessness

And I'm actually really, really glad that I'm going after Mike Carl, who I fully support and everything that he just said. Real quick, I will say, I'm very happy to hear about streaming the committee meetings. That's something that we, the People's Council of Lansing, we as individuals, America 20 to Life, we've talked about that a lot. We have a lot of apathy going on in our city. Apathy comes from a lack of civic engagement. This is how you create civic engagement. You start to build trust.  With that being said, we cannot just do that, because I know I'm saying great kudos, and, you know, both can be true, and we still have to rectify with what's already been done and how we got into some of the places that we're at now. I really hope that you all do a deep dive into the budget conversations. Please do not feel pressured to pass another budget that is going to cause for future harm. Please. That is all I ask. It constantly feels like  Wash, rinse, repeat. It goes the same way. We know it is not right. We know it needs a deeper dive. We know that there's issues, but we feel pressured to pass it through. We've got to stop this cycle of destruction.  Going back to what Mike Carl just talked about, we have a real issue with accountability right now in our city government at all levels. Huge, huge issue. City employees, departments, this includes the mayor's office specifically, because that accountability is a layer of protection for us as citizens to ensure that our needs are being met. They are not being met.  There is a whole huge, I can assure you, major, various, vast segments of our cities, of our city, that's not happening. Their needs are not being met in so many different ways. We know that a lack of accountability leads to corruption. It leads to funds mismanagement. But most of all, it leads to incompetence.  And I am seeing levels of incompetence that I cannot believe. It literally is appalling, and it is mortifying, and it is terrifying because it has been allowed to continue and to go on. And that incompetence can go from the top down. We have to rectify with the fact that we have some serious incompetence going on. It is not personal. It is not attacking.  It is transparency. And I am so tired of that conversation being led into that, that it is attacking people. It is personal. It is not. It is something that we as citizens are entitled to because we can't do that. Only you all can. We can't hold people accountable for anything. We can only tell you and ask you to do so. But accountability is also necessary to ensure, again, that all citizens are heard, not just those that have favor,  or know someone, all citizens.",Governance and Civic Engagement

Accountability is a major piece of this, but I want to talk about the correspondence that I put in. And I'm hoping that anybody listening out here in the world and all of you are going to pay attention to this. For three years, I believe, since 2019 when I put this federal lawsuit in, I was hearing rumbles from that close sessions that this is a slam dunk.  that we ain't got to worry about this. This is just one unhappy person. Even the mayor said that. It was quoted in the City Pulse. This is one unhappy individual. We held a training. We're moving forward. That's very interesting because that came up in the trial that we held the training. And it happened to be a year after the fact that the piece of paper that you guys seen that the HR department put out stated this needs to be done immediately. The training needs to be held immediately. So that piece of paper gives recommendations for what exactly should have happened so that we wouldn't have ended up here.  But the problem was this mayor and this administration was in there by the time we found out that even existed.  So they took a hard stance that I'm lying, that I'm just one unhappy person, as the mayor stated. And this city attorney, who works at his pleasure, decided I'm going to fight it that way. I'm not going to try to find any truth in what is being said or any liability in what is being said. I'm going to fight it from that perspective. And that's the ignorance that has gotten you to the point where you owe me now $1.25 million with interest and attorney fees with a motion that the attorney talked about asking for $500,000.  So let's talk about what they stand to lose or win with those motions. What they stand to win is possible new trial. They have to ask the same judge who sat through a five-day trial, listened to all the evidence, and allowed a jury to make a decision to admit that he made a fault, he made some issues. Because it's not based on fact. The only thing they can return is something that was done legally wrong.  So they're asking the judge who overseen this thing to turn back around and say, yep, I'm going to give you a new trial. The problem with that thought process is that if you get a new trial, the same evidence stands. You still lose.  So what are we standing to win here? We're both in a situation where we're taking a gamble. I'm taking a gamble on losing $750,000 by saying I'll settle for that amount. And whatever future gains I get from my wrongful termination, you know that's coming. Or the work comp trial is coming up in two months. But I'm willing to make that stance and say, hey, I'm willing to give that up. They're not willing to give anything up.  If they lose this, it's 1.75 million. Now they can file this off and go file more appeals and drag this out for more years and pay more outside attorneys and wrap the city up in all of that to, again, get a new trial. What do they stand to win by muelling up right now? Other than not having to stand in the newspaper that we found ourselves having an issue here, we're paying out for a settlement. That's what they're standing to win. That's it. Not financially.  So spatter for I'm sorry to bore you, bro. It's OK. All right. Thank you.",Governance and Civic Engagement

I'm also speaking on the issue that the two ladies before me spoke on. I live in the Westside neighborhood. I live on Drexel Road, which is probably about a block and a half from the intersection that they're talking about. And I know they brought up a lot of technical things. I would rather tell you a few more personal things, being that I live right there. I'm also not in agreement with changing that light to a blinking light.  When Drexel comes up to Jennison, it comes up at an angle and there's about a 20 to 30 foot space before it hits Saginaw. When you're coming off Drexel, you have to stop there and wait, and when Saginaw's not stopping and it's going that fast,  the traffic tends to back up on Jennison, and so you're stuck on Drexel, Jennison's stuck because they can't turn right, and it really backs things up. So I personally, and I doubt I'm the only one, have taken to going to the intersection just west of that that actually has the regular light. I was also concerned about the fatality that they're mentioning. I could see it from my house. I could see them putting up the  you know, the guards to block the view. It was disturbing. And the other side that I think Mary kind of talked about a little bit is when you're coming from Oakland on Jennison back into the neighborhood, there is a business there that has a sign and a bush and you cannot see the traffic coming.  until it's almost on top of you. And if they're speeding, that makes it very difficult to decide if it's safe to go or not. And as if fate were to come in, as I'm coming down here, I had two cars weaving in and out of traffic almost hit me in that area when I was coming down here tonight.  Taking out lights and making Saginaw go faster. I don't think is the wisest decision That's just my personal opinion. I'll you know, I think it should go back. There was nothing wrong with it the way it was I think we're trying to fix something that's not broken and I think we should go back to how it was so it's the the flow of traffic is easier in and out of the neighborhood because that does affect us that live there and Also for safety reasons. I don't want to see any more fatal accidents from my house. I  So that would be very much appreciated. So thank you.",Transportation and Mobility

How are we going to fill a $50 million hole next fiscal year when there's no ARPA and CIRA and CARES funds available and you've plugged all these little gaps and holes with this little windfall money?  Are we going to suddenly be told, well, you know, we hired three people in this department, but now because there's no more ARPA money, we have to let those folks go. What's it gonna translate to, to quality of life for all of us in the city? And relating to that, a little episode for your information. Yesterday on Southbound Cedar, I was nearly hit by a wrong way driver and it missed me by about two feet before it hit the car adjacent to me.  It took 30 minutes for LPD to respond to that crash. Well, one of those vehicles sat in the road at risk of being hit again by another vehicle, and the three of us occupants of those two cars stood out in the cold, including a three-year-old child, so that we wouldn't get hit in our vehicles.  I was told that the reason it took so long for LPD to respond was because out of the 16 people that normally work on that shift, only eight were there. Now, why there were only eight that particular day in shift, I can't tell you. Maybe it relates to the three that retired last week that had 25 years' experience each, and we lost 75 years' worth of institutional knowledge.  Maybe it relates to the fact that we're, as we hear constantly, having difficulty hiring because we're not responding quickly enough, our wages aren't good enough, our benefits aren't good enough to compete with other companies. And then you've got $215,000 in the general fund budget under Sister City, LEAP support, My Brother, My Keeper, arts and cultures grants, et cetera.  that might be better spent up in wages for fire and police and making the turnaround quicker for them getting hired and giving them the benefits they need to stay in a job instead of making a lateral move to another municipality that can do a better job providing for them.

It was eight years for the hiatus on the CSO project. Why I'm here is the chip seal deal. Obviously, it's a catastrophe. Nobody's going to own that. You're not going to have an employee stand up and admit that due to their lack of due diligence in the contract that there were millions of dollars worth of damage done across the city.  I mean, most employees can't break a mirror on a truck without getting written up. At-will employees are at-will for a reason, so they can be held accountable. They need to be held accountable, and the work needs to be done and completed. One of the problems with that is the city is sneaking around a little bit, testing these areas with the sweepers, and what they're finding is, like the crews reported, that chip seal is sharp.  It's a straight grinder on the equipment. It's eating the conveyor belts on the sweepers, the few sweepers that we have that you heard about. So yeah, they are down. They are going down quickly and expeditiously because they're running over that chip seal that is absolutely sharp. The catch basins are full. They're over full.  They're trying to vac them out. Those chip seals, or those little chips, are also clogging the vacs up. Those are metal impellers in there. So they're having trouble even cleaning those out. But with the CSO project and all our concern, I mean, that project, 20-year project, started in the 70s. I'll let you do the math.  But how are we going to clean these catch basins out, and when are we going to do that? There was no mention of that. And he also acted like there was no cost involved. I know for a fact that the streets that they did experiment on, they had to go over them two, three, four times to get everything up. So tell me there's no added expense to that. And that's just an absolute fallacy.  Your tree problem, biggest part on your trees is you're allowing these contractors to come in here after the CSO project, and they're putting in ornamentals. That doesn't meet national standards. National standards is three-quarters trunk. The reason for that is then within a few years, the canopy gets above the maintenance vehicles, so they can, in fact, get to the curb. What, like you told you, there's nobody gonna water these, there's nobody trimming them.  If you want to know where to plant them, I guess you could plant them next to the 4,000 plus stumps that we're doing absolutely nothing to remove. And I also wonder, we're moving right along on the compost. I got to wonder, does that mean that all six employees that the fee pays for are hired?  They're all on staff, it pays for six, four compost, and two in recycle. I'd like to know if all those positions are full.",Utilities

Let's see, I wanna talk about the hypocrisy that takes place during these meetings. You guys tell us not to clap, but after you guys have a little ceremony here, you guys always clap, and so it seems like do as I say, not as I do. Another thing I wanna talk about is the city ordinance that we have in place, 1460.01, which states that  any red tag building shall be vacated and that no person shall occupy any such structure or allow any domestic animal to occupy any such structure. Right there, it states that any building that has been red tagged should not be occupied. Yet, we have people who are living in red tag properties. So right there, the city attorney's office in this city is violating its own city laws. And nobody is being held accountable.  Nobody. We are a nation of laws and we cannot pick and choose which laws we're going to uphold and let the other ones go. It needs to be across the board when it comes to holding people accountable. You talked about a 17 year old that died in this city. There's a toddler that died in this city. All from the same problem because the properties are not registered with the city.  because the properties don't have smoke detectors, because the properties didn't pass inspection, because the properties don't have rental certificates. Next week is going to mark a month since you guys held that red tag emergency meeting that we had, a month, and yet we haven't seen any plan from you guys. There hasn't been any action put in place since then. Andy doesn't have a plan. What he gave to WLNS the other day, that interview, that was a propaganda. I read it.  He didn't say anything that was meaningful or had any plan put in place. That's why he can't show up to meetings. He claims to be the CEO of this city and he can't show up to meetings because he's scared because he doesn't have a plan. He's not a real leader. Real leaders show up even when things get hard. They don't send their five deputies to come talk to us. You guys have no shame, literally no shame at all.  People are dying in this city and that doesn't even move you guys.

Uh, what I'm seeing is the tale of two cities really is what we got going on here. And it's frustrating to me because I'm on the side that I'm kind of, kind of fighting against, right? I'm somebody who's kind of middle class. I have all my basic needs met. Um, and then I seem to be speaking for those who don't. So it's kind of,  contradictory to my own self that I'm asking for things that I should be happy about, or she's asking for things to go away that I should be happy about, like our downtown.  I talked about that, all this new downtown development. And Carol, you're right. The mayor did come on and say that he's looking for federal spending and whatnot. I think it's $5 million to the Michigan Corridor, revitalization, $800,000 to building a playground. And when I think about that, I think five years ago, I would have been super excited about that stuff, because I was just a middle class guy that had a Corvette.  and was like trying to figure out where I can go have a drink on a patio somewhere. So all of the stuff that they're building would have excited me. And then I got into this realm of advocacy when I started to look around me and I started to feel shameful for enjoying those environments while people around me were begging for change, and it aggravated me. Then when I'd go outside when I used to smoke cigarettes, to smoke a cigarette, and the homeless person would come asking me why I'm trying to enjoy my weekend for a dollar.  And it would aggravate me even though I would give him that dollar. And I can remember that I was that person. And when I talked to some moderates in this city and some people who voted for Andy again in this administration, they tell me that they think this city is on a good track. It's doing a good thing. And that's the tale of two cities. You got some people who feel like everything is amazing.  Then you got others who are just dealing with life every day, trying to just survive. And then you have me that's in the middle, right, is trying to say, hey, are we not paying attention to these people as well? And then I get this sour response. They're like, I don't have to be up here advocating for these issues. I say this every time I come up here. I'm taken care of. Fine. Three months in Florida every year. I'm cool.  Even with everything that I've gone through, and I still show up here every week to speak for the constituents that you all serve as well, to name that this is just corruption at its finest. We're literally living in the Sims world, but we have a player that's like putting the phone down for six months at a time.  And if you've ever played Sims, you know what that means. You come back, your house is on fire, there's no food, there's no water, the city systems have all gone to hell. That's literally what we have. So every time you guys have all these influxes of issues, and it is, it's one red flag after another. And this red flag with the red tag houses, he'll get ahead of by the media because we have nobody from council who you all know the problems for real. Somebody from here needs to designate themselves as a Andy BS meter.  And you're going to, every time he goes to WLX to say some BS because they're all behind him, backing him, you stand up to tell the truth.

And I too agree with Rachel on everything she just said. I think a lot of the issues that we see are definitely a result of a lack of accountability. And I think the strong mayor system simply does not work for the city of Lansing, Michigan, of our size, our scope. And we're not just seeing it, it's really apparent this administration, but I think we can all agree we've also seen that in the past. So I'm in agreements there.  Tonight, we heard from several directors and we have over the last few weeks when we're talking about the budget conversations because a lot of really great questions have been brought up, a lot of comments, a lot of conversation and discussion around really important things. And we found out a lot of really, really disturbing red flag type things over the last few weeks based on some of those answers and a lot of those non-answers. And I wanted to talk about some of the issues and the questions and the concerns that have come up  that are literally not even remotely new at all. Some issues are actually years in the making and that there are still no tangible actions. There's no plans or anything that's already in process. Just once, I would love to hear a literal list of things that have been done, things that have been accomplished over the last year, along with some action items that are in process. And then we end it with some plans for what's to come.  It seems like there's a lot of focusing on talking about problems and identifying problems, what they want to do, what things that they have planned and things that they're looking at without really taking any concrete steps to actually address the issues. And the issue with that is it leaves zero room for accountability or progress.  We the people at this point, I'm sure you can tell, are very, very tired. We are tired of the propaganda. We are tired of being lied to. We're tired of being gaslit, being told about all the great things that are going on downtown and the events that the mayor is attending and where he's having lunch today, all while our city burns around us. There's a word that we all know, and it's used in the corporate world usually, and it's called firefighting.  It describes situations where a person or a team only addresses problems that arise as a result of their own actions, inactions, and decisions. And it is the most inefficient, ineffective, and harmful way of working. And if the person responsible for creating the problems is also the one who's tasked with solving them,  The root causes will never be addressed, just the symptoms. And usually that's with the bandaid that comes off constantly. And just long enough for the most recent fire to be put out. This is a very tactical and deliberate attempt to create a positive perception of our city and our mayor's reputation. And a mayor's reputation should never matter more than solving the issues of our city.",Governance and Civic Engagement

But thank you, council members, for your action on the resolution in October. I really do appreciate that we've got committee meetings and council meetings viewable on YouTube. I also watch from home when I'm not able to be here in person.  And I think we heard plenty of reasons, real life reasons, why being able to have two-way access to city council meetings is important here today, earlier. So I'm not going to get into that. I'm sure you can think of plenty of reasons why somebody  would be unable to make it here in person, but would be able to stream live. You know, I am going to get into it. I'm in a volunteer group where somebody joins on their lunch break, right? Like I can't drive here and come to city council on my lunch break. So there's all kinds of reasons. Anyway, we emailed you for an update. Didn't get any response about that.  And I was kind of thinking back to 2022 the last time I was here in person was when you all passed the resolution And I asked like why? Why why what why we aren't just continuing on with the zoom? Piece of it and you all said it was a budget issue so I would really love an update since it's been  You know almost six months now an update to how much that costs since that was the issue that was told to me I would love that so I'm gonna send another email and hopefully someone will respond to me to give an update and where we're at with the two-way council meetings and  But I will also like to mention that, you know, we heard about quite a few problems that are happening in the city and I know, like, I work in public service and sometimes I'm like looking at the list of things that are wrong and I'm like, oh my gosh, I'm never gonna be able to get to any of this. Like, it feels very overwhelming.  the housing crisis, the homelessness crisis, we've got a lot going on. And what it really feels like it boils down to me is that there is no way to hold people accountable within our current system. I also believe that you all are doing everything you can. I don't think that you are holding up progress in this city. I think the problem is the mayoral system  We need to have a charter change to a city manager system. So I wanted to throw that out there as a way to be able to hold folks accountable to all of these different things that probably feel really overwhelming to you.

I am a first ward resident. After moving to Michigan in 2016 to this area specifically, I didn't truly feel invested in my community until I began tuning into city council meetings in 2020 on Zoom. And hearing my neighbors speak about  Their lives and the things that impacted the city made me feel like I was a part of something bigger I know that it's probably a lot of work to sit here and listen to so many people talk Especially when you know you care right you're you're in these positions because you care and compassion fatigue is a real thing And so I'm asking you to give me a couple more minutes to talk about why this is important  I still tune into the live stream every other week. I don't often get to make it down here. In fact, this is the first time I'm able to look most of you in the eyes, and so I'm really grateful for this opportunity, and I made it possible for myself to be here tonight through making arrangements so that I can make my voice be heard, and on behalf of our neighbors whose voices are still waiting to be heard. Please continue working for two-way communication in city council meetings.  We know that real change happens in local politics. That sounded like a question. I do that when I'm nervous. Sorry. We know that real change happens in local politics. And so I'm asking you to bring the change making to the community members who elected you, even if they're tuning in from home. Thank you for your commitment to increasing accessibility  for attending meetings, and I hope that you will please follow through in the next step of the resolution that you passed in October.  I wasn't gonna make this joke, but I have time, so I'm gonna do it. This isn't written, so it'll be a little more casual, but I am in recovery from a substance use disorder, and I know that city council might make you feel like drinking, but city council makes me not drink because I'm paying attention. I have something to put my time in, something to invest in. Even though you don't see me, I'm, again, this sounds weird, but I'm watching. I'm watching you all.

Not only am I formerly incarcerated, but that's the population that I work with between both jobs and housing and  Employment are the two biggest issues that I see the formerly incarcerated person face.

Not exactly new, but  The fire that killed a 17-year-old here in Lansing, cold compliance problem, as I spoke of, a fire in a rental property without smoke detectors. Now, I assume the city has caused it to be,  pushed over, the building has been pushed over now that the fire inspectors are done and nobody has come to clean it up. That has been for at least six weeks. All I need to say, we have some problems, code compliance.  Lastly, and this will be a little bit more involved, what the hell is this city budget about? The mayor, I understand, develops the budget, and he's not here tonight, and that's really disappointing to me. We have a budget where I'm seeing one thing that is particularly irksome, and that is  economic development and planning. We have something called Downtown Lansing, Inc., and they have decided to go for an overall budget increase of 514.4%. I presume that's with all the CARES and whatever grants are coming through.  I don't know what Downtown Lansing Inc. does, but I do see what is happening downtown. And all I'll say is this budget is absurd, and can't we get back to simply taking care of our city?

So, you know, a company whose parent is a net worth of nearly $7 billion was enough to make my stomach turn. But now, after hearing what people have to say about  that property that burned down, where a 17-year-old died. That makes what I have to say about consumers' energy look like a mild annoyance by comparison. In general,  leaving little oversight and regulations on many, many buildings, properties and houses, this can actually lead to hazards like this occur to possibly fire hazards and can lead to someone's death like what happened to that 17 year old teenager. I mean, I remember what it was like to be 17 years old. I was a junior in high school thinking about my career as an adult and  For someone who was probably also thinking of that, to have their life cut short because of a fire, that just not only saddens me, it angers me that something like this happened. And there are many reasons. And speaking of properties, the fact that there are several buildings that are being rad teched shows that leaving things  to the market is actually not the best idea out there. I mean, there's some things that should be left to markets, but right, but properties should problem, but overseeing property should not be left to private solely to private businesses. Government should at least have some oversight.  And I feel really sorry for people who have had lived in those unsafe properties, who were just recently red-tagged, because nobody deserves to live in unsafe places like that. There needs to not only be harsher regulations on properties, but they also need to be better utilized to prevent properties from being unsafe for anyone at all to live in, let alone  cause a fire or something like that. And it's not only another reason why we need to be better at managing our budget, we need to do certain increased funds for certain departments.  We also need to be better utilizing them as well and be more, and also be more transparent about them because there are people who are, because there could be people dying because of situations like this and some who actually did.

I absolutely love Lansing and there's a lot I could say today. So we'll just see what I can do in three minutes. Hi, I'm Daniel Arnold, Facebook guy, smiley. I'm a mop, a member of the public, a conscientious citizen that does my civic duty to report danger.  and support public safety, local, state, federal, advocating for vulnerable populations, homeless, addicts, ex-offenders, mental health consumers. Jesus is Lord, I'll never be bored. So I was at this public safety committee meeting and I heard Council Member Hussain share about the broken window theory thing that I brought up and that just really touched my heart to see you guys listening and interacting. So there's just so many different sectors that I mentioned for the vulnerable populations.  The homeless, you know, like, there's just a lot of services out there. I don't know if they're reaching everybody, but, you know, in the park, there's these non-profits like Punks With Lunch and Cardboard Profits that are just reaching out and just loving on them without any compensation. But, you know, also City Rescue Mission is just feeding every single night, and it's just, I enjoy, as a community member, the opportunity to just fellowship with them and enjoy some food.  Addicts, there's programs like Endeavor House and Celebrate Recovery and Rise, but it's really hard to be an addict in Lansing for some of these people because there's just so much temptation around, but it's just a part of our community, so we've got to consider them. Ex-offenders want to be called returning citizens, and I see Ashia Wilson is up.  who's been out here today. Nation Outside is just doing great things to fight for, help get housing for the returning citizens. And mental health, as I said, there's a community forum that is meeting this Thursday at 5.30 at the Fledge. Luna founded that, and it's just really important that we give a voice to people who have their rights violated.  Well, I guess I have enough time to talk a little bit longer here.

On Friday, April 21st, I saw a building permit posted at 4924 MLK. The name Greenhaven Inc. was on the permit. It was applied for in November 11th of 2021.  issued on January 3rd, 22, and it expired 7-22. I had no other information about the business. Since this business is in my neighborhood and in the old L&L corporate office, I started to investigate. Today, April 24, I found out from my third ward, Council Member Hussain, it was a marijuana micro-business.  and the only one in Ward 3, and it had a conditional approved license from the city clerk's office. It is my understanding the name has now been changed to Haven Investments. I'd like to see that building permit, if there is one. Is this another code compliance problem?  Surprise, our neighborhood, nor Councilman Hussain, knew it was going to be a marijuana micro-business pending state approval. Seems at least the third ward council member should have gotten this information. So much for transparency again.  Thank you very much, Council Member Hussain. If it were not for you, I would not have gotten this information and been able to comment tonight. Just so Fourth Ward knows, residents, you have one too. It's called Spartan MBLLC, and it's located at 4600 North Grand River.  This message is for Mayor Schor. So much for neighborhood engagement, working together, or building trust. You have lost all those sayings and so much more from me because they are now just empty words. I'd like to have this also placed on public notice. Okay, thank you.

Uh, just thinking about what happened last night, just, uh, hitting close to home that there was a 48 year old who was shot dead at Rudder Park. And that is just something to think about. Uh, you know, uh,  And I noticed that state police and CSI were, you know, around the park and it's just, it's just, it's really touches home with the homeless because they said that the guy got shot, his name was psycho or something, but yeah, that I'm just, I'm just reflecting on that for a second here. But on another note, I'm thinking about the library, the capital area district library downtown. It's really a very, very nice resource for the homeless. It's just a quiet, peaceful place where everybody from all walks of life can gather. But there's just one issue with it, and that is for the whole building, the adult male, there's only one toilet.  for everybody. They used to have a basement bathroom and for some reason they've decided that they're gonna make that unaccessible. So there could be a situation where somebody walks into that bathroom and somebody might be just spending a lot of time in the stall and people will be coming in and checking on the bathroom, having to go and there's just no bathroom resource and with so many homeless, it just seems like it's a real catastrophe to put all that burden on CATA.  So I asked them what the reason for that is, and I think it was sort of like, they said they only had one security officer for the whole building. There's like all these different floors of the library. And so I really, I just want to start brainstorming and thinking about solutions to that, getting that extra bathroom, whatever it takes. Maybe I noticed there were a lot of different librarians at booths, just like tons of librarians.  I didn't understand why there's all these different librarians just sitting there behind the desk, and then there's one security officer. It just seems, maybe a second security officer, I don't know. And I know I should probably go before the board of directors for the library and start looking into this, but it just seems like a real tragedy to not have a toilet to use for the homeless at the library. I'm also hearing a lot of talking about  this initiative to a fair chance housing. We have a lot of people representing nation outside in different organizations here. And I grew up and was in the riots at MSU in 99. And I really, really could have gotten felonies, but for some reason I was spared and got my misdemeanor. Now here I am advocating for police stuff and everything. And I have this wonderful apartment at Riverfront on housing voucher.  but it's just not that way for everybody and everybody deserves a chance. And the last thing I wanna say is, you know, we have a security police in this building every day, just doing a wonderful job. They're right down there at the checkpoint right now, watching you guys all and hearing this whole message from all of you and just show your support for those people who are always laboring for our safety.

First of all, I do want to say that I'm in favor of the Harry Hubler development. We become very myopic in this city and all we ever think about anymore is affordable, affordable, low income.  And I'm not against affordable but we cannot sustain our city and nothing but affordable. We have to start bringing in a higher income earner to pay higher taxes so we can take care of our most vulnerable. And we have to start having a more holistic vision of our city not just high end not just low end. We need balance. And I am highly in favor of this development. It's in my neighborhood.  People like to throw gentrification around. This is not gentrification. These houses have been empty. They are boarded up. They are horrible. And it's not okay for people to live in homes in Michigan with no insulation, no proper windows, and no proper heating. It's not okay. That is no better than a tent. So in Lansing, I don't believe we've ever had gentrification, and I really get tired of hearing that being thrown around.  Having said that, everybody knows I work with the homeless, so I have a heart for the homeless. I have a heart for the felons that need a place to go. If you've done your time, you've done your time. But Lansing cannot sustain it. Emily Diependorf, I believe, is working on an initiative for the fair housing statewide. It needs to be a statewide issue, not a Lansing issue. We also need to address affordable housing as a region.  Every area that touches our border engages in exclusionary zoning. That is nothing more than modern day redlining. They do it so they don't have to take people like us. They don't have to take low income. They don't have to do affordable housing. They don't have to do low income housing.  It isn't, I work with the homeless. I will tell you very few are from Lansing, very few. These are not Lansing residents. I love them anyway. I'll help them anyway. But we're not looking at Lansing residents. So this needs to be an issue by this council and this administration and our state legislators to get that discriminatory exclusionary zoning outlawed. They've outlawed it in California. There's absolute precedence for it.  And we have to stop looking at us as taking care of everything. We can't do it. We can do some of it. We can do our fair share. We can't do it all. One last thing. Joe McDonald said we were 69% behind under the Alice measures for poverty. That is absolutely incorrect. He used absolute wrong data.  That would be the statewide and that would include Detroit Saginaw. So be careful of what you believe. Thank you.",Housing

I'm going to finish on my comments from earlier.  about what we're not getting and what we deserve. Lansing just doesn't have any real vision, and this is why we just kind of go and fall for anything. I hate to seem like this is an attack on the mayor's office, but it truly is just, and I think what everybody was saying from the dais about this mayor's office and so on, it's just fact, and it's professional conversation. It shouldn't really be taken personal. So you don't have to apologize for that. But as I'm looking across the agenda, excuse me, the budget, I'm seeing all these places where more money needs to be.  Right? Obviously with fire, police is whatever. But at the end of the day, there's public service and all these places need more money. But we have these exuberant amount of money and allocation towards jobs out of this office that really  in all actuality is costing us more money than it is giving us anything back. And I talked about this when it comes to the lawsuits. It's really the biggest, in my opinion, one of the biggest threats to our budget is all these lawsuits, whether it be from attorney's fees, whether it be to settlements, or whether it be to actual verdicts such as mine for a million dollars. That's our biggest budgetary items that aren't really giving us anything back.  And so when I look at it, I think, well, if we put a million dollars into the fire department, we'll get a fire truck. If we put a million dollars into the LPD, we'll get more officers. The amount of money that's coming out of, you know, lawsuits and Department of Justice investigations out of this mayor's office and the HR department is just costing us more and more and more money. But he's got all of these positions up here that are supposed to be rectifying and making sure we don't get to this point. So we're not getting what we deserve out of that ask. So the only thing you guys can do as council is cut it back.  Period. Don't ask all the questions. Don't put people on the spot. You guys have an opportunity on May 17th, I believe the date is, to just cut it out. Give him what you believe that that office needs. Give others and put money where else you think that it should go that's going to be more palatable. $979,000, I believe, after Smirka said that MMRMA is who does our liability insurance, I went and looked up on the budget where that name would all be at.  And it was on a line item of contractors that are paid, and it was $975,000 is paid so far in fiscal year 22.  That's to what he said was our lawyers and our third party that sends the money then to the lawyers, right? That's the type of money we're spending because of this office and the HR department not being able to do the job correctly. And you guys have all the evidence you need to know because those are the very same names and not her especially because she's only been here like six months, eight months, whatever. But just that office in itself has been on multiple reports.  When asked, where's the racism at? What's going on? Why is this here? Well, the mayor's office is what's really doing it. MIDAC put a whole report in. You guys all seen it. MPHI came up here and did a whole report. The fire department did a whole report. HR department and the mayor's office was pulling these things out. So pull from that budget, give him what he needs, put that other money. Look how much money we spent trying to affect change. And the Department of Justice just two months ago came in here and wiped it again. So we have to really focus on that aspect of it. So please do something about that.",Governance and Civic Engagement

Everything today, it seems like, has been about housing. It's a huge crisis, and I know that you all know that. I know so many people, everybody that I know is struggling with housing right now, struggling to find places that they can live in that aren't infested with bats, with roaches, that are affordable and still places that you can raise a baby that's safe to live in. And hearing about,  Hearing the report on the red tags made me think of what happened to me a few weeks ago. When I got a call, we got a ticket from code enforcement. There was really no explanation on the ticket, why we got it for, so we called. Indoor furniture outside was what we got the ticket for.  We look outside and we're like, okay, so we have some chairs on our porch that we're using because there's a lot of people who live in this house and we like to hang out on our porch. So we have a code enforcement officer come to our house, check it out and say, no, you're not allowed to have those. Call again, can we get some kind of, you know, referrals, some kind of, visited twice and spent, I'm sure, over an hour of his time that day  And this was a few weeks ago in the middle of this crisis that is happening with all these red tax homes and people not, basically the department being a mess. And so it just seems like you're going to need to get the entire department figured out. You need a staff person who's checking, you need to put the staff time into actually figuring out how to get landlords to do what they're supposed to be doing rather than penalizing renters  doing things that are not high priority. It makes no sense to spend an hour of someone's time in these small things. You need a staff person, like was discussed earlier, you need a staff person who's checking on developers to see if they're doing what they've promised you they're going to do. You need to have someone who's doing code enforcement on landlords to see whether they're  they are discriminating on a lot of things that are already against the law. And you need to pass this fair chance housing ordinance in order to make sure that people cannot be discriminated against for being returning citizens. But that's never going to work. That's never going to actually come into reality if you don't have the staff and the accountability in the department to make sure that you can hold landlords accountable.",Housing

One thing, Patricia, you brought up sweepers. You took that up. And one of the issues with your sweepers is right now two of them are down. One of them is called the Global. That's a manufacturer. They have a manufacturer's issue. They're trying to engineer a fix. Who knows how long that'll take?  The other one that's down has broken spring. It's been broken for quite some time. Well, one of your problems is that since Mark Parker retired, some of you know him through the retirement board and everything else, but that's what he did, 40 hours a week, eight hours a day, specifically worked on the sweeper fleet each and every day to keep it up and operating and on the road. That hasn't been done since Mark left.  You need to dedicate somebody in fleet services, specific to the sweepers, day in, day out, 40 hours a week, keep them on the road. That's what you got to do. Plain and simple. I think we're all feeling the pain of the seasonals, you know, as far as your getting applicants, you know. Those were your applicants. That was your pool of trained applicants. Many of them had been here for years, been trained in several departments, all kinds of equipment.  You know, you gave them 50 cents an hour to be pack-up packer operators, and then you, not you, but they abused the situation and wouldn't let them out. You know, used them 24-7 in there. And so when they could get out, they left. This year, the processing, you had some 400 maintenance workers, went through the whole process, hands-on tests, passed them with flying colors. But by the time they got processed through HR, they found other work. They're not going to wait.  especially with the benefits and wages that we're offering. So, you know, that's just not going to happen. You know, you're paying United, what was it, $588,000 a year to maintain the parks and the cemeteries?  And I got to wonder with that kind of money a year, is Washington Park still free to them? They still get to use that for absolutely nothing? Our parkland, our building, you know, that'd be better served as a community center or something.  Obviously they're making enough money, they could rent a facility, an empty facility somewhere in town. So we need to think about those options. And I don't know if you've ever heard of the book called The Color of Law.  But if you haven't, you might want to familiarize yourselves with it. And also, more people filed with the DOJ just recently for retaliation by the city. You know at the settlement with the police officer, plainly said on page 10, you got to put some... Thank you.  classes together for your employees.",Utilities

I taught in the Lansing School District for a lot of years. I've seen  People come and go, and I give this council a lot of credit. I've seen all the work that you are burdened with to do, and I am grateful for that. What I'm here for today is so that you do not forget something that the Nation Outside group is really interested in having, and that is housing for returning citizens and making it easier for them  to get a place to live. I know people are concerned about public safety and returning citizens. They're fearful of their returning to their criminal ways. But I have seen a lot of people where I work at Northwest Initiative who come in fearful of what they have to do now that they're home.  and they can't find a place to live. One young man I spoke to today, and I don't know his full situation, but he's living in a closet. And I was shocked to hear him say that. And with the help of our community passing this ordinance for safe and just place to live, it would really be helpful for those people.  I myself have a son who is incarcerated. He came home once and looked at me and said, mom, it would be easier for me to go back to prison because he couldn't get what he needed. He was homeless.  even though he had me to live with, but he wanted to be independent. And it is such a serious, serious thing. And I just don't want this ordinance to fall between the cracks. I was here three months ago to speak on it.  I went to a community of the whole to hear what was being done and was told that we're putting it, we need to do some more and to study it. And I don't, I haven't heard of it since. And I would like to have it brought before you again. Thank you.",Homelessness

Um, so before the pandemic, I worked as a full-time housing case manager, uh, for a year here in Lansing, mostly working with adults with disabilities in permanent supportive housing. So the most vulnerable people, um, by far the best part of my job was the relationship I was able to develop with my clients.  People have been in Lansing for decades, people with big families and small families, people who love Lansing, who are kind, who are resilient. And many of these folks did also have a criminal record. They had formerly served time, but they were past that.  So I want to pause and just say there's already many barriers to finding housing, to finding affordable housing. Number one, mayor, sure, not enough affordable housing. Number two, discriminatory practices based on race, based on citizenship statuses and other things. Number three, discriminatory practices based on income. So that's really important because that's the way property owners get around discriminating against people experiencing poverty.  and sometimes along racial lines as well. So people living paycheck to paycheck are priced out of properties because three times the income, which is a common requirement, is an astronomical request. So then let's add inflation. And then let's add that you have a felony conviction. There is almost no housing for you. The few places that accept you for housing are in high crime areas with violence and drugs.  So, when we tell people that serving time is how they make right, but then they have nowhere to live and nowhere to work, and I've been in a situation where I've appealed the decision to reject them, and we sit down and we write a letter about how they've changed in their life, decades of their life, and we put it into one page, and then they deny it, because there's no accountability.  There's no recourse for them. So that's why I'm here to speak on that in support of that. Let's see here. Yeah, so $150 for failure to certify rentals. That seems really low compared to how much they might make in one month from rent. That doesn't make any sense. Those are completely wrong numbers for each other. That seems crazy.  So my experiences with red tagging was that, you know, it doesn't help when you red tag a place if there's not enough affordable housing. What you're doing is unhousing people while there's not enough affordable housing. So it seems like you're sort of working at it from like the backward trying to crawl back to the forward. You need to be thinking forward about how much affordable housing there is. Thank you.",Housing

I can test, I can attest to their shortage of staff at least two weeks ago when 18 or 16 people should have been on duty and eight were on duty. So we know there's a strong issue there that has to be dealt with.  I'm going to throw out an idea for consideration, maybe just even just starting a conversation about whether or not it's viable, and please take it as an attempt to look at something not like, oh, we can't do that because, but instead look at it like, well, maybe if we talk it through, there might be a way we could do this.  We know that a lot of the fire department runs, the paramedic runs, are what you might call frequent flyer or nuisance runs or medical taxi runs. Basically somebody stubs their toe, they've got a migraine, they have the flu, they broke an ankle or whatever, and so they have no other way to get to the ER because they can't  get a bus at three in the morning, they can't afford an Uber, they don't have any taxis left in town. So what if we, instead of using an entire paramedic crew and a full ambulance to respond to those, what if we developed a fleet of medical taxis?  that only dealt with those nuisance small minor runs and were staffed strictly by EMS staff instead of tying up our paramedics in an entire ambulance rig. Is that something we could think about? Is it something we could talk about? Is there any way that that could potentially be viable to pick up these folks in a medical taxi instead of tying up an ambulance and a crew? Just a thought.",Public Safety and Law Enforcement

I first real quick wanted to start off by saying earlier, cause I couldn't get to on my last comments, but I wanted to acknowledge council member Jackson's comments earlier in talking about the new development. I agree that he is right in the questions that he was asking. And I know that that's something that is a little cringe worthy.  But the optics of major money, power, and influence that a union of that size has and how they use it absolutely has implications. And I think that we shouldn't shy away from talking about it. It's not bad. It can be good, right? But there are questions that do need to be answered, and there's things that do need to be acknowledged when we're kind of talking about that. And Price Dobernick was also absolutely right and completely spot on in pretty much everything that he said about these developers.  I mean, I couldn't, it was almost as if he took the words out of my mouth because I've stood here at this podium so many times urging you all to vote no on these pilots, or to at least establish what the return on our investment is. Not only just that, but to track it, and then also a way to hold accountability when it's not happening.  When the bill of goods that they sit here with their great PowerPoints that were sold so that their profit margins can fly and then it turns out to be rotten. What do we do then? How do we even know? We don't know. I asked in the participatory budget meetings if it's tracked. It is not.  After that, the mayor gave some very long-winded comments about all these things they sign, and these things that they do, and how they're supposed to do this, and the things that they agree to. I heard nothing that addressed adherence and compliance to that.  We can all agree, we clearly have an issue with that, right? Track record, not great. We have an agreement with people that enter agreements with us, not holding up their ends of their deals. So we have now learned publicly, through the questioning of department heads, that we have personnel issues, that we have a lack of continued meaningful oversight of department heads. The entire Red Tag situation, wow. We have a serious problem with follow-through.  We're literally living in a groundhog day of complacency and it's led to reactive only solutions and it literally has created a vacuum. There is a void of the capacity to have a true vision of what our city truly needs and for us to meet the potential of what we know that we have in our city to meet the needs of our people. We just don't have the capacity for it at this point.  I also want to acknowledge the swing of the pendulum that we're experiencing that happens with extremes. Times of what a lot of people viewed as combative, right, to a really big quest for collaboration. I get it. There's room for both. But collaboration and amicableness is not more valuable. And there is often, when there is no place for nuance and there's no place to have a consensus and status quo, the budget is one of them.  You have to be the ones that ask the questions. Those times are right now. If Nancy Malo can put together a budget, y'all can say no to one.",Governance and Civic Engagement

LS_05_15_23,LS,"Lansing, MI",2023-05-15,2023-05-01,Training,Public Comment,Commenter,4120.0,4304.0,"Hello again, Erica Lynn. I agree with Jody. I think the sense of urgency that's created by this timeline gives a lot of us heartburn. It's really difficult because along with a lot of other times where we've heard of things being passed and  We've heard you all make comments like, I didn't have enough time to really review this. We weren't given enough time to really think about this intentionally. You don't ever want to feel that way about the budget, where it's like D-Day, and it just has to be passed today, even if we feel like there are things that could have been thought about a little bit differently. So that timeline, I think that's worth talking about.  I do want to kind of start off, I want to address something because this kept being talked about with personnel and with changes and broad personnel changes and cuts and things like that. I really want to point out, I think that there needs to be an understanding that that was never a call from anyone that I heard from the public.  We were never calling for broad personnel changes or to not fill positions. That was never an ask. That was never on the table for us. That would not be good for Lansing. And that wouldn't be the solution. We were really specific and intentional with our asks based on what we heard and what we didn't hear from departmental presentations and questions answered and questions not answered. And that was very specific to the mayor's office budget on personnel and the HRCS personnel budget. So again, specifically the personnel, the people,  There are 12 departments across this city with 12 department heads. I think that we are okay to rely on the expertise and the experience and the pay for those individuals to run those departments that run our city. I think a bloated mayor's office budget, having so much personnel and optional staff and things like that, when we are in times of a bloated budget, of a budget that we know is bloated, that we know is excessive and we have to make cuts,  The head of the snake, the person steering the ship, that should always be the first individual to say, we're going to go down to a shoestring budget, and we're going to operate with the two people that the charter designates, and it's time to, you know, lessen the time that we have for other things, fun things. I always use the analogy, and this will go for  this particular budget, administration budget, the personnel. As a parent, you constantly ask your kids when they want to go outside and play, did you get your business taken care of? Is your room clean? Is your homework done? Have you done everything that you were supposed to do before you asked me to go outside and play?  Well, before we go to lunch, before we do ribbon cuttings, before we attend community events and concerts in the park, maybe we spend more time in the office getting things done and actually working, putting in sweat equity instead of bloating personnel budgets to have seven people supporting what should be a two-position budget. That's what we were looking for. I would never advocate for anything else other than that, other than looking creatively at what we can do to ensure that we are okay.  Thank you to the work that was put in. I don't envy the situation that you're put in Carol to do this, but thank you for putting in the work to at least get it passed.",Governance and Civic Engagement

All I'm gonna say about the budget is that while I do think that there are some, sometimes budgets need to be cut, there are budgets that actually need to be cut and those that don't. I mean, cutting spending for parks, like you kidding me? That's really just not something that should be cut.  but instead and well i admire the work uh miss wood did to at least salvage it i'm not gonna use the simile here that you might be thinking of because uh this is city tv but you can guess what it is and  because I feel like even when you're trying to fix something that's kind of broken beyond repair it's really just I don't it only really helps slightly and honestly just  I feel like there are budgets that definitely should have been cut, but just weren't, like the fact that police is still overspent. And now I've just found out that the mayor's office is also overspent quite a lot. So those are two things that need to have severe limits on their spending.  And also, a lot of these austerity measures have negative consequences, which again, won't discuss because it's personal. So, well, I'm glad something was passed.  I still think it was kind of half baked and just kind of rushed into completion. It just feels like something like went wrong when something was going on. And this honestly is my kind of opinion on this current administration. A lot of things just went wrong with his administration when it could have gone right considering their previous record in previous positions.

Shelby Frayer was brought in here back in 2000 I believe 18 to look at this budget to really figure out where we were overspending at because we had depleted at that point in time a portion of our rainy day fund but then we got to a point we weren't even going to be able to handle anymore. Shelby Frayer is now deputy mayor. The mayor's staff and when we talk about that and why that needs to change  I think he really does need all that stuff, so let me just be honest. Because I never really hear any substantial anything coming from this guy other than the next dancing thing or the next celebration or the next whatever it is. Almost like a non-profit program director more than a mayor or somebody who's actually supposed to be knowing this stuff. So really, Carol, I apologize, because it's not your fault.  It's almost like when a used car salesman upsells a car for like $10,000, but really they're trying to get $5,000 out of it. So you might fall in line because you're just trying to do a good thing at $7,500, and then they make $2,500 more on the car, and really the car's only worth $5,000. So I think that it's not your fault.  It's not any of you guys' fault, because he really brought you a sham budget. I mean, the budget had no intentions on being legit whatsoever. The conversations surrounding getting rid of boots on the ground, I really hate you to keep saying that narrative, Carol, because we talked about this for weeks and weeks and weeks and weeks. Up here, we don't want to get rid of any boots on the ground.  Definitely not getting rid of boots on the ground. We need to fill those positions. You need to get rid of the up top positions that aren't doing anything for their money. Because we didn't hear from boots on the ground. Boots on the ground are not coming in and sit through these tables and you ask them what their job description is. The up head people came in here and you asked them what their job descriptions were. And they told you what their job descriptions were. And then you said, well, we're not getting that out of it. Right? The man came to the last COW meeting and said, you know, in East Lansing you might pay all this money and all this taxes, but you see it. You're walking down the road and you're not stubbing your toe on a pothole.  You see where your money's going. Our violence isn't like it is in Lansing. So when we're spending this type of money, 200 and some odd million dollars or whatever, if we're spending that type of money, we should be, we should still not, we should not be talking about sidewalks. We should not be talking about warming centers. We shouldn't be talking about any, we should live in a city of gold, literally.  a city of gold for that amount of money they were spending. So when we're talking about these budget cuts, what I would have proposed, if I had have been sitting up there, is a 10% cut across the board, except for police, fire, and city operations, which is essentials, right? A 10% cut, get rid of the mayor's office and all of his budget to help him control the 12 departments, and knock it down to what the charters asked for. Maybe give him an assistant, right? Because he needs somebody to schedule all the ribbon cuttings that he goes to.  Outside of that, anything non-essential or miscellaneous and any of that stuff, get rid of it. This is what you do when you're in a budget crisis. When you're not meeting the budget, when I'm at home and my light bill comes back at $5,000 or whatever the case it comes back to, I don't just get to say, I'm going to give you $5,000 if I can't find it in my bank account. So why are you guys any different? Why is the city any different?  I appreciate what you guys have done. I think we did get some nice stuff. I appreciate that. But we can't just keep saying this is what we've always done. So let's do something better next year. Thank you.",Governance and Civic Engagement

I get to wake up and just be around all you people out here who really care about the city and...  I visit 10 government properties a day to speak to local, state, federal security police.

Right here I have  This necklace, this badge necklace, it says police protect and serve with a cross in the middle.

They're feeding everybody really good food and just sharing what's on their heart to share, you know, with their faith. And so, you know, they need people to serve. They need people to come up and, you know,  you know, donate food, donate money, come and serve food, come and work there. So there's just so many wonderful things going on. We have Ruter Park, you know, Cardboard Province is out there, Punk's with Lunch, Homeless Angels. All these people are going out and just taking, I get to enjoy all these meals and be around all these people and want to be their voice. And then my church is there for me too. They're taking care of people at Crossroads Church.

I wanted to address the council today over No Mo May. I just recently learned that the city has been levying fines against residents who have been participating in this act of environmental stewardship.  I have emailed the mayor my opinions on the matter. As a University of Illinois graduate in Earth Science and Environmental Sustainability, as well as a Michigan State graduate in Forestry, been working in forestry for about five years now since graduating, and I believe that the city of Lansing should be allowing residents to participate without the threat of fines. It is literally the bare minimum  that residents can do to be good environmental stewards. I don't need to be up here extolling the virtues of pollinator species. I think we all know how beneficial they are to our environment and our lives. Sorry, I'm a little nervous, this is my very first council meeting.  And to build a dedicated pollinator garden to provide food for our pollinator species in the most vulnerable months of the year takes a lot of time, effort, money, knowledge, skill. I mean, if any of you garden, sometimes it can be hard to keep these things alive and know exactly when bloom times are occurring and all that.  By providing that opportunity for residents to participate in No-Mow May without the threat of fines, they can literally do nothing. It takes no skill, no money, no time, and they benefit insects that we need for our environment, as well as, in addition to, helps to limit use of gas, unnecessary gas, to mow these lawns.  reduces emission that comes from these mowers. And it would just be, it'd be beneficial to be able to halt the levying of fines until June 1st, every year to allow residents to be able to do this, participate in this action. And it also would help forward the city of Lansing's commitment to environmental stewardship, environmental sustainability as well. So thank you very much.",Environment and Sustainability

I met with the treasurer about eight weeks ago in regarding saving my house that I lost to a fire two years ago when the fire went up and out the window. And I was told by Mr. Fox that I had to secure $15,000 by the end of the month.  I have secured that money with the contents of a private adjuster that I've hired for the contents of my home. And I've reached out several times to the treasurer, the mayor, Mr. McDonald, many, many people. And my time is running out and no one is listening. And I'm not trying to lose my home. I've had seven children in that home. My daughter who passed bought me that home. I want, I now live in a Simtah building.  You know, it makes no sense. I've been a property tax owner for 23 years and I don't know why there's no help in this community. I've been everywhere up and down, you know, there's no help. I'm a, I'm a mother of three little boys who was a widow and it just makes no sense that there's no help in our community. There's no help from our community leader. What is the purpose of them? And I waive the rest of my time.",Housing

I keep hearing everybody talk about Shelby, Shelby this, Shelby that. Where did Shelby come from? Well, Shelby got suggested for her job by the financial health team, Brian Felleck, Dave Hollister. She got the job, filled her staff with high-priced employees, and one of the first things she did was turn around and give Brian Felleck,  the CSO oversight contract, and then abruptly left the city. Went to work for the guy at John Bean, he went into receivership, and then he went to Flint, and now she's back here. I don't know how all that happened, but it all seems like a big conflict of interest. To move on, the chip ceiling. What a travesty. And now your new superintendents,  Deputy, whatever you want to call these guys. They really got no business being in charge. They're not, they don't have the education or the qualifications. They were simply moved up when Jim Campfield and Crime Brank and Vic Rose left. They were just kind of moved up through attrition, not because they have the education or the skill set. That's obvious, they don't. They have recently made the decision that they're not going to sweep  the entire areas that were chip sealed. All they're gonna do is the gutter pans, and that's it. So are we as residents supposed to blow all of those chips into the gutter pans so they'll get cleaned up? How are we gonna get this cleaned up when the people in charge come down here and say one thing to the dias and the people, and then tell their employees to do something that is obviously not what they told everybody?  You know that that that that doesn't wash. It doesn't pass the smell test I hate to tell them how to do it, but The way it's done tried and true is you run a flusher truck down the middle of the street you push all that stuff to the gutter pan and Then you sweep it up, and that's the way streets are traditionally swept So you don't have to make three or four trips up and down the street  The flusher truck fills up at the hydrant, flushes the middle of the street to the curbs, the sweepers clean it up. And that's the way it works. And that's the way it needs to be done. This is a travesty and it needs to be addressed. They need to be held accountable. We talked about accountability tonight. They're at will for a reason. That reason is accountability. It is time to hold Andy Kilpatrick  accountable for this travesty that has happened throughout the city of Lansing. Like I said, Meridian Township's fix, pave everything they did, because that is the only fix.",Governance and Civic Engagement

The paramedics are up there having to give people Narcan from drug overdoses. It finally culminated with shots being fired at the house.  the police captain, Captain Deal, she got right on it. There was some meetings with the city attorney, code compliance. It went on for a while, but finally the house went up for sale and we've got a nice resident in there. Now on the 26th of April,  We have a house on 1128 Cooper Avenue. Large number of shots were fired in there at night. We were hoping we could get some answers from the police department. I walked down there after a few neighbors told me about it. I found two bullet holes in the door, six in the window, two upstairs. The glass was smashed.  And I talked to two of the residents, they said they heard the shots and to them it sounded like it wasn't semi-automatic, it may have been something else. And the two residents told me there were, I don't know how they got this information that there were over 40 bullet casings that the police picked up. Someone was home, I guess no one was injured.  I sent Catherine Deal an email about this, see if we could get some cooperation like we did before. All she told me was I would have to file a Freedom of Information Act on this. I don't know why we can't get the cooperation we had before on this. The people on Cooper, the 11-1200 block, they're taxpayers just like they are on Woodbine.  And I had to notify code enforcement about it. And so they tagged the house for some violations. It almost seems like the captain has a hidden agenda on this. Can you refer this to the public safety committee and see if we can get some answers? All we want is the same treatment that we had before on Woodbine. It's got a lot of people nervous about it.  Be appreciated. Thank you.",Public Safety and Law Enforcement

So I'm here for a couple of things. Number one is to remember Dr. Carnegie, recently passed longtime principal at Saxton High School, community person, pastor.  very much respected in the community. I had the pleasure of working with him on the police commission the last couple of years and he's going to be missed. And I just wanted to bring up the fact that we lost a very important person in our community. So our condolences to the family and friends. Secondly, you know, as an elected official, you know, I know that sometimes we make decisions  And they need to be made, whatever it is, good, better, in between. The question is, how do we move forward? And I hope that both parties after this decision can get together and work for the betterment of all. I don't know all the details, but then again, something's got to happen. And I think that working together for the betterment is the thing to do. A gripe of mine is that  We're Pothole City, USA, you know. I talked to Adam a long time ago. You know, and I look at it this way. I think we need to invest some time and effort to find funding, if not from our general fund, to find it somewhere. Because when you fix a street, you uplift a neighborhood.  And eventually, property values go up. And if they go up, that means money for the city. So I think it's a long-term investment that will eventually pay off, and I think sooner than later. So I ask that you spend some time, you know, looking at different ways of funding our streets.",General Community Organizing

I think this is the third time tonight, but I'm going to start off by saying thank you. Thank you because tonight's decision,  I think it absolutely sets an extremely powerful example for leadership. I think it says something to the people that couldn't have been said any other way. There was literally no other way to set the type of precedence that was set tonight. And I think that your willingness to make those tough choices is going to pave the way for  a lot of what I hope to be some different budgetary practices in the future where the budget process isn't as stressful and stress-inducing and anxiety-ridden and creates a lot of frustration. But I think that standing firm and overriding the veto, you have shown that our city's financial stability is important. And that's something that I've been trying to impress upon you that it's not just about today. This is not a new problem. This is not something that just cropped up this year.  The last two budgets deserved this level of scrutiny and this level of amendments and this level of discord, probably the last four to five. But I will say it's also important to note the primary purpose of a city government, and I guess I could say this is my opinion, is to serve the community. It is to address the needs of its residents. So a part of the budget process in your role is to allocate resources based on community needs, right?  That should not be a fight. And it also shouldn't be an afterthought. It should always be the goal that we work backwards from.  We talk a lot about equity, a lot, a lot of people, a lot of people in different city departments and city of, you know, elected officials. We talk about equity a lot. And I just want to remind everyone that equity always starts at the underserved. It starts at the marginalized and the left behind. And all things that are rooted in equity should always take a front seat to executive staff positions, to redundant positions, redundant roles, redundant duties and high salaries.  Always. It has to. And to be the city that we all love, and I know that you all love, and that we all fight for every single day, we have to prioritize community needs over that. I also wanted to say, to Kelsey's point, it almost brought me to tears when she talked about some of the really horrible things that have happened as of recent.  But I also want to say that Lansing does not have to be defined by the worst of it. But it takes a lot of work in order to kind of come out of a rut like that. And there's going to be a lot of tough decisions after this and a lot of sacrifice to make when it comes to that. But I do tonight feel very cautiously hopeful that there was a brick laid tonight for a new foundation for our city to not just look like a city that people from out of town want to move to or visit, but a city that the current residents can be proud of.",Governance and Civic Engagement

So first of all, what we're not going to do is act as if what just transpired and what's transpired over the last five years didn't happen.  So it's okay to keep talking about unity. It's okay to keep talking about moving forward. But I've heard that at least 15 times after this, this administration has completely derelict the duty, the community just completely done that or hit a murder in the jail. So let's talk about who we're talking about when we're talking about working together. That's the same individual who put that budget together, told Carol she, he wasn't going to go back on it and then came back here and behind you guys back and you all just said it happened.  No, why is it so hard to recognize that we're dealing with a corrupt executive branch? Like if once we recognize that and say it and know it, then we know how to defend against it as a community. I applaud you all because I can remember a time when I was confrontational with you all, right? Because you weren't speaking out. You guys were silent. I was talking to a brick wall about people's lives when we try to get advanced peace here.  When I try to do anything to get some money to stop the gun violence and our kids dying, I was talking to a brick wall up here, right? So I commend you guys for figuring out how to work with the community, but having this, you guys keep talking about working with them. Every chance this man gets, every chance this administration gets, they screw you. Every single time. Carol.  You know, I was so upset when you said I stuck to my word. That's because you are a stand-up individual. You are a model citizen in this city. And you made a deal with the devil, and it bit you. And here we are talking about working again and working again without acknowledging the harm that's being done, the person that's doing this stuff, and the fact that its propensity to do it is just overwhelming over top of helping people. So let's just acknowledge it. Let's be real with it so we understand where we all stand.  Period. Everybody. And so like, you know, I was a firefighter. I was one of those people that guy came up here and said that, you know, should be on top of the earth. I put, I risked my life. I've walked into burning buildings. I pulled babies out of buildings. Right. But that person would tell you that our involvement civically is personal. We don't like him.  And it's acceptable to say that, too. And most people believe it. Because people aren't down here in this office, in this room right here, seeing the actuality of what's happening in our city. So when I'm out in the world, I'm crazy pants. And here, it's like, damn, you know what? He's probably right. So I appreciate when this dais is full, because people get to actually see the truth, yo.  Until you all admit that we're dealing with a corrupt executive branch, we're never going to be able to work together. So you have to know a snake is a snake. You don't have to stop them from being that. You just have to know what you're coming in the room with, know how to handle it, know how to deal with it. But every time we get all mushy and want to grab hands and unite with somebody corrupt and willing to throw the most marginalized down the river, and we ain't acknowledging that, now we're just complicit.  So let's at least acknowledge the fact of what he just tried to do today, what he's done over the last five years before we start talking about unifying.",Governance and Civic Engagement

I just want to congratulate the city council for actually stepping up and overriding the mayor's veto. And I'll just say this about, again, what I've said before about what the mayor did. What he did again was dereliction of duty, turning his back on someone who made a deal with him saying, you better not turn your back on me. And guess what? Turned his back on us.  And I'm just going to say this right now. I know this is a little personal, but I'm just going to say tech.  with my past friendship with him. Because I'll just declare, we're no longer friends. Just straight up, right here and now. I can't believe I had any respect for the guy. Because this is just straight up one of the most corrupt things I have ever seen.  I've known about corrupt governments. I've known how my family has lived through Nixon's resignation and the Watergate scandal. And I've had to live through many wars that should not have happened, like Iraq and Afghanistan. I've lived through many of Trump's corruption while he was president.  And seeing this, this is just about on the same level. And this is another one of the reasons why I think opening up the state charter is necessary so that we can open up representation from all across the city by increasing the number of wards in order to ensure that more and more of the people can make sure that the mayor is accountable. Any mayor in particular,  regardless of who they are, but especially Mr. Schor. And I just, and while I'm not entirely in favor of a city manager system, I am, however, in favor of an actual position of a deputy mayor, not just that useless staff position that calls itself the deputy mayor, like an actual rank.  like second to the mayor, kind of like a lieutenant governor or a vice president who presides over the city council and breaks ties, which I'm sure there are ties that may happen, whether or not we have a bit of an interesting predicament on the city council.  So, and also another, and also to make the city attorney, who is right in front of us right now, an elected official rather than an appointed official, so they're accountable to the people and don't have to worry about getting fired by the mayor, but rather reelected by the people.

I want to thank all of you for overriding the mayor's veto. We needed this for many years for every council member to stand up and listen to the people. This is a win for all of us. There are many out there that still need to be heard. Excuse me. I was one of them. Due to nobody helping me, I now suffer from congestive heart failure from the mold, the asbestos,  and the carbon monoxide that I was left to live in all those years. Otherwise, I had become 100% homeless.  So let's not let this happen to anybody else. When somebody comes to you, I ask you with all my heart, don't let them be another me. Listen, help them, support them, and represent them. That's why we have you. And you've proven tonight that you can do it. We have a win. Now, I have something I need to say. When the last gentleman was speaking about the city attorney, I was very appalled that he thought that was funny and busted out laughing.  These are the citizens that are speaking, and they need to be heard and respected. Now, we can go back to Mayor Schor. He don't show up on crucial matters. You know, this is a consistent thing of him missing. That's somebody that's spineless.  He sits there and says he takes it personal. No, he made it personal for the people that are victims. These people are suffering because of his choices. And we need to stop that. We need to show him, you guys are gonna stand up against him, the city attorney, and Code Compliance. We have 311 right now. Jane said last time she spoke, she spoke too. All kinds of citizens calling her. I've called 311, trying to get through.  They couldn't get through to her, they said they can't reach, they can take messages. So they take the messages, they say they don't know when they can be picked up or when they will, they try to call themselves, they get turned in to their own 311.

I agree with all these people, I just did not come for that reason. I came to be a character reference for Mr. Daniel Nowland. Dan and I are friends, we have our differences. He attends multiple churches, I belong to none.  He's a big fan of police. On behalf of the marginalized people I have long served, I have a problem with the behavior of police who practice brutality. Dan and I find common ground in our desire to build trust between the community and the law enforcement side. I served on the ALPAC, that's Allies and Leaders for Police and Community Respect, since its inception more than three years ago.  until I was kicked out a couple months ago. Because guess what? The police don't want to hear the voices of the people. You've been patient in listening to them, but the police would rather not, so they kicked me off. Now, Dan is in good standing with Alpact, because he's a big fan of police. He's, remember, in good standing. And let's see. I had to write this down. He's...  People have been traumatized by law enforcement officers who practice brutality and who killed people or injured them severely just because they look like them. I mean, you're traumatized, right? Now, mind you, the community members on the LPAC do want to hear from the people. And that's why they keep sending me links so I can attend the LPAC meetings. But I don't want to go where I'm not wanted.  I don't want to go where I can't hurt. I'm not the only one. There's plenty of people who agree with me, so let them carry the ball.  Dan is welcome there. He loves people who he talks to every day, both people who preserve, protect, and defend. And I admire him for taking a job. He admires police who take a job that gets them into dangerous situations. He's welcome on the LPACT. He also talks to members of the community who have been marginalized. So I admire him for his courage in overcoming many massive challenges.  So if the mayor sends out a press release to draw people's attention to some good thing that happened in Lansing, Dan wants to know about it and he wants all the people he talks to to know about it. So why doesn't the mayor invite him to the press release events?  It would definitely serve the people. We all need to hear good news sometimes, don't we?

I'm not going to read the entire email just because for sake of time, but I'm going to reference it and hopefully it's referenced later. But you all may already be aware of it. I hope you have. I hope that more people from the public forwarded on to you all, because it is of great concern. There was an email sent out today by the mayor of our city soliciting funds  in order to contribute to certain city council candidates' campaigns and support. I don't know how to, you know, formally, I'll look into it, but I want to publicly address that because according to the Michigan Municipal League, the Michigan Statute Act 160, 1976,  That's MCL 15.401. I'm sure you all are very aware of that because it's political activities and what is allowed and what is not allowed. That email absolutely violates that statute. The public official, which is our mayor, is using his position and his public assets, which would be his title and his position  as mayor for his personal political benefit. He is soliciting contributions to his leadership fund, seeking support for his vision for the city, which is absolutely a personal political endeavor. That is the very definition of that.  That statute prohibits any public officials from using any public assets for any personal political gain or for the benefit of others seeking elective office. So using, by very nature, the title of mayor to seek personal political benefit or the political benefit of others is an absolute violation because it implies the endorsement  and or the support of the city and its resources for personal political purposes. So even though I know that there's, you know, city attorney may have been consulted, whatever, even though that official email was not used, using the title of mayor in a communication that's related to any political activities is still seen as leveraging one's position.  the public authority of that position for personal political gain. That statute exists to ensure that public officials do not use their titles or their positions to advance personal or political interests regardless of what email is used or what platform used for communication. So the implications are clear, and I think that that needs to be addressed very specifically. I have a little bit of time left. I also want to address something that was very, very egregious and was flatly denied and dishonest last week at the East Side Neighborhood  There were some public comments made and I know you all are, it was referred to committee for the ethics violation report that came out. I do want to completely acknowledge that the comments that I read that were made by the mayor regarding council member Brown were extremely unprofessional.  I would stand that that is also an ethics violation. And the fact that he publicly, publicly denied making those statements, even though we have them on record with the actual complaint that he absolutely did make them, I think that also calls for an investigation as well. He made those accusations that were very unfounded. And I think that in addition to the egregious nature, the harm that it caused inevitably should also be investigated.",Governance and Civic Engagement

Why? Because of everything I heard tonight, again, about the different neighborhoods, committees, and all of that, he has actually reached out to people to help.  His job is to be a civil servant, and that is what he is. The things that I've seen and heard tonight have just really just vexed me. Neighborhood segregations. We don't want an apartment here. We don't want that there. The report, I read the report. Actually, I read all 200 pages of the agenda tonight, and I was disgusted, totally. Again, your CEO is not in the room.  I'm just baffled. This same man, for two and a half years, I've reached out to say, hey, I need your help. And I'm just going to call it what it is, racism. You can come when a white person comes and says, we have no hot water. He came to Autumn Ridge.  I had no heat on the coldest day there was. Did he show up? No. What really, and excuse my French, I'm going to say, what the hell is really going on in this city? Why are we doing this? Why are we segregated? Why don't we care? If it's not somebody that he wants to deal with, he's not going to deal with it. I'm reading this report, you're attacking a black man. You attacked me after a council meeting saying what I wanted. I'm grieved that.  This man can still run this city with no ramifications and all the ethical violations that he does, but we want to slap Councilman Brown and say, hey, we can kick him out. He might need to go. We need to start top down. Let's do some investigating because there's no checks and balances. There's nothing in place. I've been here 30, I loved this city when I came here. I'm disgusted not to even say I live in Lansing. There's nothing here.  that makes me want to stay. The only reason I'm here is because I am a school board member and because I believe that at some point in life somebody will hear the voice that I have to make a difference. He's upset because I work for MSHDA and I gave my boss that red tag. Yeah, I'm gonna say it, I did. Because one, those numbers are not right. We don't have 600 red tags. We have more than that. Autumn Ridge should not be counted as one unit. It's 618 units.  That's thousands of people that are going to be homeless soon. What are we doing?"" Councilman Brown has said, what can I do? He gave me everybody in this room and some to no avail. When I walked out of here on 8th March, nobody has called to say, what's going on with you? If a friend did not open their door to me, guess what?  I would have been among the homeless. Do we really care? But we push his agenda because he's the mayor, so whatever he says goes, and anybody that's in the way that boxes is going to be harmed in some form or fashion. Well, I refuse to allow that to happen any longer by all means. If I have to go to the President of the United States, it's time for us to make a difference. Each one of you, I love you as people, but  We can't continue to bother his will and whims. It's no good anymore. I mean, it is what it is, separation and segregation. That's what it comes out to.

I am not a justice impacted person. I have no criminal history whatsoever. I'm just a volunteer for Nation Outside. And I was a housing navigator. And as a housing navigator, it was my job to house the homeless by putting them on programs and finding housing units and connecting them with landlords.  And as you can imagine, this was a very impossible task, trying to house people that had justice-impacted records.  I would take, it would take me months if not years to find a room rental that was $500 a month or less with utilities included. And when I finally found it, my client would be so excited and everything seemed to line up perfectly. But once the landlord ran those background checks, it was constant, no, no, no, no. And I'd have to go back to my clients and tell them that they were denied for the 75th time because of their  background checks and they would cry and cry and explain to me how they're trying to work their way up in life, they're trying to get better, they're trying to live a better life and the doors just keep slamming on them because of what they did in the past.  And as I worked with my clients, I would see that none of them were committing crimes anymore. They were just trying to get their lives together. And these landlords wouldn't even see my clients. They would just see the background charge and deny them. And I would have to watch as my clients gradually just faded back into the life that they were living before. They went right back into cycling with drugs and alcohol and self-medicating through all their stress and not being able to work their way up because everybody was denying them.  And, you know, we're a society that always says we want to decrease homelessness, decrease unemployment, get rid of the crime in our streets. And then we turn around and we deny people with backgrounds, housing, good paying jobs, even higher education, even volunteer opportunities and internships.  And all that does is create homelessness, create unemployment. It contributes to crime in our streets. And it is discrimination. And it keeps happening. And they were let out from prison and jail for a reason. They were let out because they were finished.  serving their time. They finished their sentences. They had done their time.

It's because,  because Facebook guy Smiley posted it. Shout out to him for posting this. I would not have known about this had it not been for him. I'll read part of it. I know someone's already read it, but I'll just say this. Please contribute to my leadership fund so I can make sure that we have the right partners, and that should be in major quotations,  growing our city with two open seats up for grabs, which I don't know why you have to use two of those things. It's like that's overdoing it when it comes to sentences. Nobody talks like that. I am working to help elect a new generation of leaders to help to our city council. Okay.  I'm just gonna say this very clearly. It is up to the people of the city of Lansing to decide who should be elected to our city council. Not our mayor, not anyone currently serving on council, the people of the city of Lansing. I will give congrats to the elected officials who actually had the decency to declare that they  won't be endorsing any candidates. I will not be saying their names, but I'm glad they have a sense of, well, of neutrality and understanding that the people of the city of Lansing should speak before them and not the other way around.  But too bad the mayor doesn't have that sense of decency. And I'm just gonna say this very clearly, and I'm just gonna say it bluntly. I know there's been several calls that the mayor should resign over the years. Right now, I think not only do I think he should consider resigning, he absolutely must resign because doing this is a violation of law.  This is not only that, but it's a straight-up war crime to be bribing candidates to do your bidding like that. This is just straight-up wrong on so many levels.  Well, yes, you are allowed to endorse whoever you want. I mean, there's nothing wrong with that. I mean, we do have a First Amendment, right?

As you may have seen on the news and everything else, it was pretty bad. Well, since then, they've came out and swept. The city swept during the day, so they had to go around cars and everything else, so that's not really a deluxe job by any stretch of the imagination, but they did it.  and there's still a bunch of gravel there. All they did was the gutter pans. So I gotta ask, because it was on the news and Mr. Kilpatrick was interviewed by Larry Wallace in front of City Hall, said that he was in close, I'm gonna quote that, close communication with the company. Well, when are they coming out to estimate the damage  and to estimate repairs, to look at, to even look at them, because now that the gravel's gone, there are thousands of bald spots all over the place with no gravel, anything on them. So like he told the public on public television, he's in close contact. So there's been a couple of public service meetings since then.  I'd like to know what was discussed about that. What was said? Where is he at in those discussions? What was said in those discussions? Because nothing's happening. And this is, we're almost to July now. This was supposed to be addressed in the spring, as you said, last fall. We'll be out in the spring. Well, here we are. We're in the summer.  and we're still in bad shape citywide. I'm sure Jeremy's area is the same way. I don't know if they swept your area yet. And they actually came out and cleaned a couple catch basins too. I don't know when they did that, but they came out and got them cleaned out as well. But the citizens need to know when these repairs are gonna be made, when the estimates are gonna be made, how it's gonna be paid for. That's the big question. Is there gonna be repairs made?  And if there is, the company going to come back and do it out of the goodness of their heart? Is that coming out of the stretch public service budget? Are you going to maybe not fill a few more positions so you can get somebody out there to fix it? Exactly how that's going to work. I wish Mr. Kilpatrick could fill in the council and the community as to what's going on with our roads. Thanks.",Utilities

Adam, the list that you talked about, about the red tags, where you... Sorry. You're good. I'm going to take advantage of it. Where you said we have over 600...  70 or some red tag properties. I believe we have more properties than that. As the person before me had mentioned, we can't just give one apartment that has 600 units and just mark that as one. And also, the question that I wanted to ask you was, how many of those red tag properties, how many people are living in those properties?  I think that's the most important question because that goes against our city charter. Nobody should be living in those properties. And not only do we have people who are living in there, but they're paying money. And so these landlords are profiting from these people, which should not be happening. As far as Andy's newsletter goes, he has essentially put this body up for sale and the highest bidder is gonna  decide who gets to serve this community, which is very sad. We are at a time when people have lost faith in elections and politics and our public servants. And the last thing we need is a mayor who is essentially trying to buy people. And you guys should all condemn that. There should be condemnation across the board saying that you guys are not up for sale and anybody who wants to serve this community  should do it the right way, which is knock doors, talk to people, address the issues that are important to them, and not just seek the mayor's money. As far as people who wants to donate to that funding, I think whoever donates to that cause is dumb because if you support a candidate,  which I happen to be a candidate for city council, you can directly go to my website and donate to me. You don't need a middle man to support your candidate. So this is a way for Andy to steal money from folks. That's what he's pretty much doing. He's stealing money from folks. He's gonna use that money for his next office. God knows what that is. He tried to leave the city a couple months ago to run for Congress, so who knows?  But Andy's a thief, he's a liar, he's just a terrible leader. He would rather do anything besides the work that he's being paid to do, which is very shameful because he's getting paid $130,000 and we don't need him sending out letters encouraging his biggest donors to donate so that he can handpick who gets to serve.  He's pretty much trying to stack city council, just pack. It's like, it's no different from if we allowed Joe Biden to pick who serves on Congress and who, if he decided to pack the Supreme Court, that's literally what's going to be happening here in the city, unless we say something and stand up against that.

I even researched whether or not it was illegal or not, and I was probably going to stand here and give it to him the entire time. I'm sick and tired of this, man. Again, I'll start off with the illustrious mayor and what that Juneteenth committee said here.  I really do want, so I'm going to follow Nicholas Zandi in state. First of all, that guy's a genius. He's brilliant, honestly, when it comes to politics, man. I know you all listen, you know, we get a lot of laughs sometimes, but at the end of the day, dude's a genius when it comes to this stuff. So I'm going to ride with him on this. I think it's time for you guys to pull an all-confidence vote. Absolutely. For sure. I think all of the neighborhood groups need to call for his resignation. That's an absolute fact. I think that you guys need to pull an ethics violations investigation, the same as you guys did on  You guys have all been told right here in public about what all the lies that he's made. Ryan, you witnessed him lie about the statements he made against Jeffrey Brown. So I remember a lot of you all spoke to why you all signed on to the ethics complaint. Not necessarily because you believed it was a complaint, but because you heard third, fourth person and were advised by the city attorney that you needed to sign on to that. Well, you all need to absolutely pull out of the ethics complaint.  on this stuff in an investigation, a full-on investigation. And it doesn't need to go to the city attorney. It doesn't need to go to the mayor appointed ethics board. It needs to be an outside attorney, maybe the department of justice. Somebody needs to look into this heavily.  And not just this, but all the lying that goes on out here in the community. All the times that he said one thing in here, lied to the media, the whole situation behind him and Carol and his budget, he straight lied about it to the media. I mean, he didn't even get out of this office, this Dias Good, and went to his office and lied to the media immediately. Why is nobody calling this out?  And this is why somebody said today, well, it's getting really bold with this, but this is what unchecked corruption does. It gets bolder and bolder and bolder, period. And then we keep having meetings that are just status quo.  This has got to stop, period. I just don't know how much grace does an individual get, honestly. How many times can he lie to y'all's face, racism as it is, plain and simple. And she was correct. Anybody that goes against this mayor can just, we're going to get the full efforts of all of his office. They're going to come on you, whether or not it's in backdoor meetings with commissioners, whether or not it's, you know, pulling ethics complaints on people.  Whether or not it's firing you, violating your First Amendment rights, whatever the case is, if you go against them, that's what's going to happen. And you all sit back and watch this. We are a family here. You guys are just citizens. And I want to say this before I get off of here. What Mayor Schor did was absolutely illegal, plain and simple. We all know that. Even if it wasn't illegal, excuse me, I shouldn't say that. I'm sure that he ran it past the city attorney. I'm positive. And that goes back to the aspect that they can make the argument for anything. So you have to reach outside of that. But this is a warning out to those who may take those funds.  I spend a lot of time investigating this stuff. I'll spend a lot of time and resources, whatever I have, making sure that people know about this stuff. I'll show up to every neighborhood meeting, every single one of them if I got to, and I will speak at every one and talk about the people that accepted those funds. So if anybody out here is running for city council and you accept any of those dollars or an endorsement from this mayor, I will make it my number one goal to out you to everybody.

They actually had to sue them, got vehicle damage through the vehicles in the neighborhood as well. But the video that I sent you, it's Piccadilly Circle, it's right across the street from the mall. They actually had to come back and road a mill that mess up so they can come back and black top it, put a top on it to fix it.  That's really one of the only fixes, but since Andy's been down here a couple of times, there's been public service meetings, and still no response as to when are those contractors coming. He said on the news he was in close contact with them, they'd be out, and they'd at least assess the damage and see what they were going to do.  When is that going to happen? Has it happened? What was involved with the conversations? What's the cost involved? You know, this isn't going away. You know, this affects, you know, probably everybody up there has got people in their ward that this affects. I also sent you a video of a good chip sealing job and what it should look like. So, you know, don't, I hope we're not dropping the ball on this. This needs to be followed up.  You know, whether it's, you know, it takes the media again to get some, get some movement or what, whatever. But it needs to be taken care of. Also, like the gentleman was talking about the forestry crew, you know, we used to have 18 of those dedicated employees on the forestry crew. And then, you know, after the ice storm, we turned around and hired an out-of-state, 20 million bucks, out-of-state tree-trim hackers.  as I'm sure most of you have heard as they go through the city hacking our trees up. You know, we could have restaffed and retooled, and you would have had people that were dedicated just like them that work, live, and play in Lansing and have pride in their community. When you get companies from outside, there is none of that. And that's when you end up with chip sealing like we had. That's when you end up with the trees hacked like they are. That's when you end up with the mowing  Like it is, just mow over the paper. You know, don't worry about it. Just mow it, it'll go in the wind. Also, I'd like to report on your sweepers. You are down to one sweeper right now, and that sweeper is even broken, and they're waiting on parts. But they're still using it. They're trying to get something done.

I'm not going to cry, I have a goiter, so that affects my voice. So having said that, I was not able to come to the last council meeting, so I am going to address this issue tonight. You can only imagine my surprise when I got the email from Mayor Andy Schor asking me to contribute to his leadership fund because there are two seats up for grabs and he needs his vision brought forward and he'd like to pay for some of their campaigning, seriously.  You know, I will never forget that Abraham Lincoln said in his Gettysburg Address to honor the soldiers that died for democracy, for all people. We have a government of the people, by the people, for the people. Not a government of Andy Schor, for Andy Schor, by Andy Schor. I am so appalled that any mayor or anyone else would use their political seat  to design their own pack for their own candidates. I cannot believe this is legal, and if it is, it certainly is not ethical. He said, when I approached this subject last year about him endorsing people, that the governor does it, the president does it, so he can do it.  All righty. We are a small town of 112,648 people. We are not the country. We are not the state. And I highly doubt that Governor Whitmer or President Biden has their own leadership fund for them to campaign for and give money to candidates.  We had a mayor that stacked council. I sat on council during those times. It causes divisiveness, infighting, and chaos. The people of this city are bright enough and intelligent enough to decide who they would like to vote for. This is our city, not any mayor's city. And I resent the fact that any mayor would be so  have so much hubris that they think their vision is the only vision. I learned a long time ago, if you cannot convince a group that something is a good idea, perhaps it's not a good idea. It's okay. Everything doesn't have to be your way. As far as I know, all the candidates have been keeping it clean. But I would, to the new people running, warn you to not be a part of this.  because it's not good for you and it's not good for the mayor because chances are both of his candidates will not win and he's going to have to work with somebody he didn't pay for and endorse.",Governance and Civic Engagement

I've grown up in the city of Lansing thinking it's a, one of the greatest, one of the quote greatest places to live. However, seeing all these problems of the city, honestly, it just,  broke a lot of my childhood mindset. And just seeing, like, what has been going on, particularly the red tag issue. There have been, depending on who you ask, there could be up to, like, 600 or 1,200 properties that were red tagged, depending on if you consider that one apartment property multiple properties, considering the amount of people who live there.  And the fact of the matter is many landlords have neglected their properties for many, many years. And there seriously needs to be a serious litmus test for those who want to become landlords. I'll go into more detail about this during the candidate forum on Thursday at SWOC. So you can have a better grasp of what my opinion on this is.  Suffice to say, there seriously does need to be a litmus test and building safety, whatever does the whole, or whatever Lansing's equivalent is, also needs to inspect properties like every one to two years or half a year or something, give or take, so that these properties are maintained well enough and so that we don't end up in  Having any more properties that get red tagged in the waging now. Also, the fact that the Morris Park pool, a historic pool, has been in disrepair and only now has it actually  been put forth. And this shows like other properties have been in disrepair. I mean, currently City Hall, I mean, the fact that the doors right there are missing to the well showcases just how outdated a lot of our structure in our buildings are. We've been letting a lot of these building infrastructures deteriorate over these years without much renovation and there needs  to be proper ones for that.

First off, it's just good to see all of you. Praying for all of you for sure. Good, thank you. Secondly, I came down today to just talk about the parks and recreation. I know y'all get y'all complaints about everybody that don't do what they're supposed to do.  But I was highly impressed with the fact that I called two years ago. Understandably, COVID, everything was going on and naturally shortage of people. Faithfully, I waited two years and last week I decided to call because this tree, if you looked at it, it was going to wipe out everything in front of my house as well as part of my house. And as a result of that, the next day I called, someone came out.  Me, being patient as I am, figured, okay, they'll get around to me when the time is right. So what happened, whoever I called at the Parks and Recreation Office heard my cry for how serious this was as far as this tree falling and destroying all of my landscaping and everything. But the beauty of it was, was the people that came out and did the work, they were awesome.  And as a result of those, that crew, I got to say, there's a lot of things we can say about city workers, but in this particular case, they came out, they did their job. They didn't even take a break. I even gave them water and pop because I thought they were so impressive. And if you've seen my yard, you would see that it's detailed all the way to around that tree. Not one limb touched any of those,  landscaping materials, but I just want to encourage them for a job well done and the city council, if you all could come up with a way to like that group that was out there, they did their job for me as a home, as an owner and retired from self-employed. I would say of that crew that was there that day, if you've taken all of them and divided them off,  and put another crew with them, you would get more work out of this city by those crews and those people that have  waited patiently like I did, I'd ask them and encourage them to come forward and speak on behalf of those people that have came in and really did the work to get those jobs done for them.

One is related to agenda item 32 and 33. That was a request for rezoning. As a current member of the Lansing Board of Zoning Appeals, I have a concern about the rezoning request listed. I support the staff recommendation to deny the rezoning of property at, I believe,  3712 South Cedar street. Mr. Zachary driver, the commercial corridor specialist correctly states that granting this request would result in quote spot zoning, which is not in the best interest of the city. In fact, if the city council grants this type of rezoning request, it essentially renders educated, experienced trained staff who plan city land use ineffective.  in regards to fair chance housing. Again, I'm here before you to keep fair chance housing a priority for our community and the city of Lansing. The formerly incarcerated have all too long had too many historical and arbitrary barriers after serving their time. We need each of you to invest time and influence with the state of Michigan legislature to pass a fair chance housing law.  I urge each of you to stay up to date and informed on this legislation and stay active in the process as I have been. You may meet with our state legislators, attend committee meetings and hearings, email or call key members of the committee. Do not sit idle. I will not go away. So expect me back before you again with this issue. And lastly, in regards to the ethics complaint, uh,  and Jeffrey Brown. In my recent review of reports and minutes, I did not see a conclusion on the matter of the alleged ethics violation by council member Jeffrey Brown. I hope that the city council does not ignore or dismiss the reported and city attorney investigated alleged ethics violation by Jeffrey Brown in the past March. From the attorney report it stated,  Since Council Member Brown was not authorized to submit these proposals on behalf of the city and was not authorized to represent that it was the official position or policy of the city to request funding for these projects, I find that he violated sections 290.04, section D, and 290.04, section I, in this instance, and that was written by Guri G.

The failure of the city to accept the posted date as being timely for paying a taxes is not acceptable, nor has it ever been. This is contrary to what the state of Michigan and the federal government do. Postage dates are acceptable as being timely submission for the purposes of paying taxes by both of those entities.  My second issue involves bicycle parking. The city needs to have a new provision requiring businesses to have a place for parking of bicycles. Frequently, children are forced to leave bicycles outside of a business. This subjects them to the possibility of being stolen. Further, in terms of actually using one's bike for transportation,  If you don't have someplace to park it, then you aren't going to be able to go into a store, i.e., to purchase something and come out and get on your bike. And I would remind you that bikes are very expensive. The third issue involves distribution of gun locks. Gun locks can be obtained for free, yet the city of Lansing does not participate  in this project. When I sought gun locks for distribution, I had to use the state police, who were kind enough to provide gun locks, and also Officer Bush, who answered questions about the new legislation regarding guns. It would appear that our city is incapable of doing this. I failed to see why. The answers should be there.  People should not have to go to the state police to obtain gun locks. They should be able to obtain them here in terms of the city of Lansing. Also, it's my understanding when someone files for a concealed weapons permit, they should be given a gun lock at that point in time by the city. We need to do everything we can to reduce  The use of guns. Gun locks are not going to stop some nut from coming in with AK-15 or 47, but they can stop that person who might decide they want to get a gun and kill themselves, or some child out there who can get hold of a gun, not really know what it is, and wind up shooting somebody innocently.

And what I said to the fellow was, I think maybe, excuse me, we could look at a city sanctioned  camp. I did not say we should put camps in our parks. I did not say that we should be putting camps on private property. In fact, the entire reason I suggested city-sanctioned encampment was to keep folks out of our parks and off private property.  not to mention it's best for them because we know where they are and we can get services to them. So I was highly offended when I saw Brett Kaczynski on Fox 47 stating all the problems that there would be if we put camps in the city parks as I had suggested. I never have suggested we put camps in parks. I never will suggest that we put camps in parks.

It was Andy Schor's inappropriate use of emails to fund his favored candidates for city council.  It is, I absolutely agree, it was very inappropriate of him to do that. And I just feel that he absolutely needs to be held accountable for this. And he should consider resignation as an option. In fact, I think he definitely needs to resign because this is just unacceptable. And while there's nothing wrong with endorsing candidates for council, there is something wrong with using the city logo inappropriately in his emails.  And emailing city workers over it as well. That is just wrong on so many levels and it needs to be. And he needs to be held to account accountable for that. And adding on to that it. Um, it absolutely.  seeing that a lot of candidates like me get treated pretty badly by the media, as long as like we're not endorsed by the mayor, like what Jody said about the whole getting misquoted over a homeless encampments on whatever. I've certainly been mistreated by the media as well. I mean, the city, Paul said some things about me not being able to campaign without a car, which,  I can get around the city fine with a CATA bus. And that's also kind of insulting to low-income people who have to use the CATA bus and can't afford their own car. So I feel that's just very insulting to many candidates running for city council. And I do think that if you're going to call out any candidates, you also have to call out other candidates who are  actually sort of participating corrupt like Missy Liljay. I mean, I don't mean anything against her but her getting the endorsement of Andy Schor and considering what Andy Schor is doing the emails inappropriately it makes it just in case if she makes the general which is kind of 50-50 on whether or not she makes the general or not considering what the people have to say. She needs to make a statement about that as well saying  Yeah, like rejecting an endorsement from someone who's using emails very inappropriately. Again, I don't want anyone to harass her about it. I just need to make this clear. And Andy Schor needs to be held accountable for those whole emails things. And many in the media need to be accountable if they misrepresent candidates' quotes and whatever candidates have to do to get around the city.

My question is, as we move around doing community service here in the greater city of East Langston, I met a lot of folks who were complaining about  affordability of accommodation or houses. So I would want to know what is the city's policy in terms of balancing the relationship between the landlords and also tenants to say if there are policies that are already there that protects tenants, how best can they be strengthened that also those are vulnerable  the less privileged one cannot be found being homeless. And also I met some folks of pensioners who were saying they do not have policies that protect them after they retire.

But with everybody, and I guess everybody that's spoke on this up to this point, we're just looking for accountability. I just really don't understand how one person gets this much grace. I just don't. I mean, to the level of, you know, how much corruption goes on and having a whole city attorney's office to defend it.  It's beyond me, and really the only stopgap we have is you all. So they ask for you all to sign on to this complaint. If you feel there's things in there that need to change, speak on it. Tell us what you guys think. I don't think you guys were given that same affordability when it was written on Jeffrey Brown, and I thought that was a travesty. I thought that was a hit job.  I think the city attorney used, oh I think the mayor used the city attorney's office to write that and here we are having to send it through the same city attorney or the conversation came from him about whether or not this is liable or not. It just really blows my mind. So I would also ask that the city attorney not have anything to do with this ethics complaint whatsoever.  I also would like to see this council at some point in time or another, you know, we had a lot of questions about like the police oversight committee and it's going through the commission and the police commission and why would we do have to have a new one or, I mean, plain and simple because everybody that's commissioned or that's appointed by this mayor, we can't trust, period. They can be the best human beings in the world but if they're there because the mayor put them there, I can't trust them.  And that's just facts. So, that's why we don't trust it. And if you guys want a police oversight commission, just the same way East Lansing does, then you all appoint it. You know, there's so many things that have happened in this city over the last five years since he's been mayor. There's so many ethics violations, but none of it gets reported. Nobody will come forward. So, I mean, just like all of the lawsuits that come forward, all of those would be ethics violations. These are constitutional rights that have been violated.  But plain and simple, I was a victim of that. That's a constitutional right, and all the individuals who were named in that who have done something were city employees. Those are all ethics violations. Who's going to investigate? Who's going to look into it? Who's going to figure out some accountability for these people who keep wasting our money through lawsuits and everything else that goes on? So these people have no accountability to the money that has to go out to defend these situations or pay out when people are found guilty. They're just employees. The only way that you control their behavior is through ethics.  or discipline, which comes down from the mayor, right? So there's nobody going to give this discipline out. So that's why I ask that you all really take a look at this ethics violation. We really don't have a whole lot of time to run this. There's people that are beating doors right now the best they can in order to have a civil and, you know, an equal and equitable election. And there's somebody here trying to stack the deck. And you all know it to be true. And that's just crazy to me that that's being allowed to be done. Even so much that President Wood had to speak  Like, he has everybody's email list in the whole city and can send that out. How many people got it? Did he use company time to do that?

I'm actually jumping off of what the gentleman from Zimbabwe had said, talking about housing prices in the city, housing and rentals specifically. I, attending LCC, have actually gone to one of my previous professors, who is an economist, and talked to him about it, and he has said the same thing I've been seeing over and over again on the news, online.  Right now, housing prices and rents are going up in cities all across the United States because we are still in a housing crisis, is what they're calling it. We are desperately needing more housing. This is why we're seeing all these huge high rises going up everywhere and all these giant housing projects.  Rent in the city is getting out of control. It has been for years. My little brother just had to move out of an apartment downtown because he showed on paper his rent is going from $1,250 to $1,500. $1,250 was too high. This is a single bedroom apartment for $1,250 at the 600 lot apartments above the Meyer downtown. So rent downtown is absurd. And now when you're looking at the zoning code for Lansing,  within the city of Lansing apartment buildings are like multifamily apartments in the city it is only 29.9% not even 30% of the city allows these buildings when you're looking at like mixed use  it is down to 6.9% of city land available. Meanwhile, we have single family homes, which in residential, if we're looking at in the entire city, they are 65.9% of the city is exclusively zoned for single family. Once we get to residential, it is 80.2%. You are only allowed to have a house with one unit in it. Friends of mine are having to rent  houses designed for large family units as just 2 people living here because there are just no apartments available. Most of the places they looked at are at capacity. My apartment, which is... Ferris Apartments, took me a second, is at capacity with over 100 units. That's a 9-floor building.  I'm not asking for giant mid and high rise buildings in every single neighborhood, but when we have zoning options such as, I think it was R6B, where it requires multifamily housing to be in the style of the neighborhood, you can have single family homes converted to duplexes that will still blend in perfectly with the houses around them, but it just brings that density and brings these families  in so much of the city where it's not allowed. It opens up houses for people who need the single family. It opens up units for people who don't need the single family. And it's just, we need to start looking into great reforms into our zoning code. This should be one of our highest priorities.",Housing

I'd like to start off really quick by just reading a few excerpts because I think it needs to lay the foundation for those maybe listening that don't have the full context. If you don't have the full context of the letter in question, it is on America 20 to Life's Facebook page. We will reshare that tonight so that the letter is out there and people understand the severity of the issue at hand. Just a couple of excerpts so that I can go into why it's such an issue.  I am serving as mayor now because of you and others like you who have supported my vision for our capital city. I'm turning to you again to ask for your help to continue my vision into the future. As we implement our vision of growth, we need partners that will help. Please contribute to my leadership fund so I can make sure that we have the right partners growing our city. I am working to help elect a new generation of leaders to our city council. I, I, I, me, me, me.  That is an issue, and I want to point out that it's not lost on me that this piece of paper was sitting out front when I walked in the door. Wow, that's some transparency for you. First time I've ever seen something like that, and it's because it's in defense of the city to say we investigated ourselves and found no wrongdoing.  This tells us that there are always legal loopholes. There's always loopholes when it comes to campaign finance. This we already know. If you will notice in my ethics complaint, I did not cite campaign finance. The integrity of campaign finance is sketchy at best. I understand that. You can take money. You can spend money. But what you can't do is you cannot solicitation, send solicitations. You cannot solicit funds.  as an elected official and as a city employee for personal benefit and personal gain. That is what this was. It's also not lost on me that in this, it cites that the logo, not similar at all. It's not the same. It's funny that the letter that came out today has a new logo.  It's funny that the verb, it's changed to a little bit more of we and shared. So if there was nothing wrong with that initial letter, why change it? That in itself supports the fact that there needs to be investigation opened into that initial letter.  Again, I will state, taking out the loopholes just because something is not illegal, just because we can't find a direct correlation to something in violation, doesn't mean that the behavior should be permitted. A mayor that uses their personal position, their title for personal benefit is wrong.  and it is a threat to the very fabric of our democracy. I cannot overstate how important it is that every aspect of what transpired and even things that I may not have noted or missed are investigated to the full extent that you've investigated other extremely unfounded, rumor-milled, fueled complaints against members of this body. So I'm asking you all,  We're simply asking that elected officials and city employees act with integrity.

We have a series of  a series of properties that have been brought to court, and a lot of payments have been made, but there were pink tie that were put in, and I received a lot of call from the tenants, so I was pleading if some time could be given to me so that they will be paid. We've made a lot of payment. For instance, the West Hodge, between the month of February and April, we paid almost 11,000.  But we are behind with 2022, and I'm making the arrangement so that it will be paid. It has been brought to court. The same thing, there are about four properties that have been brought to court. So I'm pleading if it could be looked into, at least if some time could be given to me. I'm making an arrangement to sell one of the properties so that we'll be able to pay that off. Because if red tag is put in, it affects the tenants.  They will be forced to move out and also affect the payment that will be coming in. So I'm pleading if it could be looked into. We are making every effort. It will affect the tenant, it will affect us. And it will also affect the city, the income that will be coming in.  A lot of other property tenants, because of, not that I'm talking about, we have a list of people on waiting list that are waiting once the property is brought to court so that it can be rented out.

First and foremost, greetings to my African brothers and sisters. Good to see you guys. Second, I want to talk about the two gentlemen who have some records. Since when did we start giving out the death penalty in this city? Since when? Just because you have felonies on your record does not mean you received a death penalty. Just because you have some petty misdemeanors in this city does not mean  that you received a death penalty. Instead of creating holes around people who have done their time, who have served, instead of creating holes where they can fall in again and go back into the system, why don't you guys create doors so they can go into those opportunities and help and contribute to society? That is the kind of city that we want to live in and we love, not a city that rejects people just because of their past record.  We have people who are working hard to try to change. You know how hard that is? To serve 10 years in prison, come out, you can't get a house, you can't get a job, and so you think outside the box, and you try to create your own business, and you can't even get a license for that?

When we started composting and recycling, you know, we went to the people. We'd build a building. We were going to have a MRF station. We had semi-trucks. We had big, huge gondola dumpsters. We had conveyor belts with people sorting the recyclables. You know, we had people pushing stuff in Bobcats. We had six seasonal employees.  We had two enforcement officers, all of these things paid for by the recycling fee and the compost fee. We don't have any of those things anymore. And yet the fee continues to climb and climb and climb. And you're all complacent with it. You just approved an increase, $4 per lot to $117 per lot. I'd like to know how they justified that to you.  There's not a person up there that doesn't know that these jobs are not filled today. There's not one of the six filled today. The one seasonally has started full time today in one of the 400 maintenance jobs. So you're charging us in advance as a fee for all these services yet to be rendered. And yet you don't have the employees that you're charging us for. You're not sweeping that you're charging us for.  You don't have the buildings. You don't have the code compliance. You're not doing the catch basin cleaning. And I'm not against the fee. I've got two lots. I pay double on all the city taxes. They're not joined. It's one big yard, but it's two separate lots. And I don't mind paying. But I only want to pay what I'm supposed to pay. And if you're not going to do all these things that the fee is based on, that's how the fee is made. You add up everything that it costs,  And then you separate it by the taxable lots in the city and everybody pays that set amount. There's not supposed to be a profit. So if you're not going to provide the services, you don't have the employees, you haven't had them. I complained about this when I was the vice chair. So it's been going on for a decade. It's not new. You've been doing it for so long that you think it's acceptable.  This is fraud against every taxpayer in this city. Every one of you. It's fraud against you. And you're helping perpetrate it. Where is that money at? Where is the money for the six employees that you don't have? Because I've been paying for it since the spring. And you don't have one of them. Not one.  The mayor's assistant said to you guys that they couldn't even, that compost was going to be late because they didn't have a truck. So you're not, you know, this year you saved some money back for equipment, but where is that money? This is wrong. You need to reevaluate it and reassess the cost to the taxpayers.

All right, Erica Lynn. Real quick, address the elephant in the room that was really hard for me to sit through.  The city attorney's recent opinion that he keeps referring to was not regarding the complaint that I will be submitting to the Board of Ethics. So his focus on campaign finance laws and state statutes are completely irrelevant. The mayor is a public official and he's still a city employee that's bound by the city's code of ethics. That is the complaint that I am going to be submitting. That also makes the city attorney's threat to you all of a misdemeanor.  law threatening to prevent even discussing talking about the investigation of a potential ethics violations deeply concerning. That entire exchange was the epitome of oppressive and undemocratic.  It was the absolute display of weaponizing the city attorney's office. And it was on full display for the entire public to see. And I hope you all understand what that means for us and anybody that will watch this later. And I will make sure people watch that later. Citizens rely on city employees to be held to the code of ethics standards for reasons.  We rely on city officials to act with integrity and prioritize the welfare of our community, of our city, over their own personal interests. So when a mayor exploits their position for personal benefit and the city attorney's office stifles any question or even discussion of it, it undermines the trust that the city has placed in all of you.  These violations and more importantly, the response to these actions will set standards for future behavior. When morally questionable behavior is allowed to go unchecked, it will establish a very dangerous precedent that normalizes unethical behavior. Expecting elected officials to act with transparency, honesty, integrity, and accountability is the absolute minimum that we expect. And if there's even a question that anything outside of that has occurred, an investigation should be the absolute default.  This is adding to an environment where we only see optics. We see propaganda and campaigning by our mayor, the CEO of our struggling city, and a culture that we're seeing where corruption and self-interest is flourishing for the last six years.  We have to set a higher standard for how elected officials should behave, how city employees should behave, to ensure the integrity of the democratic process, and to maintain public trust. I know we said those words earlier, but I want that to sink in. Public trust is the most important thing that you all have to rely on.  The witch hunt that was council member Jeffrey Brown's situation that was driven by the mayor's office, enforced by the city attorney's office, the time and resources that were expended, it didn't stop where it should have.

I am honestly just so infuriated on just how this discussion went. It was so mind-numbingly stupid just how  how far the city attorney would go to argue with the city council and using certain laws that I'm not sure if it really gets in the way of anyone investigating as a way to block any investigation. I mean, my dad was once an attorney, but that doesn't mean that I have to use words he said in a court of law as a sledgehammer against my own political opponents. That's just wrong on so many levels.  And adding on to that, whether or not it's, again, as I've said before, whether or not it's illegal is currently unknown, which is why an investigation is necessary in that case, or in any case whatsoever, if the person is accused, regardless of their  position in government. However, it was completely reprehensible for him and just went against what he did previously back in 2021 by endorsing someone for city council who may or may not even make it past the primary and make it to the general.  I mean, there's, I mean, jury's out on whether or not Missy Liljay is actually going to make the general and whether or not the endorsement will actually help or hurt her. Because really, I just don't think endorsements really mean anything. And the fact that he's using that email to showcase his meaningless endorsements, which by the way, some of the people who received the email  were actually council members who didn't even ask for it, which is how I got the screenshot, by the way, which is how everyone on Facebook got the screenshot. It was, just shows just how corrupt the mayor is and how he's just not standing on something he once stood for. That's called, that's not only flip-flopping, that's straight up hypocrisy. And for that,  And for the city attorney to say, oh, this is flimsy on the whole thing when trying to investigate the mayor, when he almost used the exact same thing to investigate Mr. Brown on the whole thing, when they were just as, if not probably more flimsy.  And so by that logic, the mayor should be investigated almost by any means necessary to see if he actually did anything remotely illegal.

I see our mayor left because he didn't want to hear any of this, which is deplorable at best, but that's just who he is. I know a little bit about the ethics violations, right? I was drawn up on one. It didn't go through the proper channels, but I was fired for sharing a...  what I believed to be at the time a personal phone number of the police chief. All the conversations I had with that man was nothing related to city function whatsoever. It was all personal conversation.  I was actually fired through that process. We actually filed an ethics complaint against the chief for bringing that and it was denied. I was fired right here sitting in this room. There was all types of lawyers and money spent to do that. I'm really familiar about what you can and can't do. It's something we have to go through. When I got sworn in as a firefighter, I had to read that whole ethics board book. We were told you're a firefighter 24 hours of the day, seven days a week, 365. We knew.  You get caught out sloppy drunk at the bar, even though it's on your own time, you're still a fireman. You have a standard you have to uphold. I think that we have recognized that there is a standard that we all have, and there's a standard that the mayor is allowed to move through.  And the reason that is is because there absolutely is no checks and balances. He owns and hires and fires everybody who might say you're wrong or that you need to check on this, including our city attorney. So even though that city attorney answers to you all as well as he does the mayor, the mayor is the one who hires and fires them, plainly. And the mayor could tomorrow say, I don't want him anymore because he opened an investigation with the council and get rid of him, just like that. And it would be all the transparent as it is for us right now that we just seen what happened.  It'd be that transparent if he fired him. He fired him because he opened an investigation against him and nothing would still happen. And I think the problem is that we haven't really dug into that charter and maybe he's even as well as I have to find out what powers you all really actually have when he starts telling you what you can and can't do. It's like he puts you in a moment where you're sitting there thinking, you know, like even us having three minutes, can I get it all out or I'll just be safe and not say anything because I don't know what could happen.  So when you know the charter as well as maybe some of you all do, you know that that threat was just baseless, period. The fact that you guys can't have a conversation about what was discussed or what's going on or the fact that he called you up and made you all sign that and all of you all sat up here and talked about how disgusting that felt to you. But what happens when that happens? Where's the accountability for those individuals, even the city attorney?  Does the Department of Justice have to come in here and investigate them again? Because as you said up there, Righteous is all out. They're being investigated by the Department of Justice as we sit here for the way that they treated LPD officers and retaliation.

The $130 million we're getting from the state for all of these different projects. First and foremost, let's thank Sarah Anthony.  Sam Singh, Cara Hope, and Emily Dievendorf, some developers that actually fought for us to get this. This did not come from the mayor's office. And I'm going to say that now because I don't want to hear about all of his great deeds in two years when he decides to run again. He didn't do it. OK? Secondly on that.  As this comes forward, I hope everybody, and I know Jeremy's going to lead the pack on this, it must be done with local and union labor, period. These are our tax dollars going into all of these projects, and I don't even want to begin to hear that our people didn't have transparency in bidding, didn't have the opportunity to bid on it, and were looked over.  Carol knows we worked really hard to do a transparency bidding ordinance and the chamber came in at the last minute sideways and destroyed it all. So Jeremy and the rest of you, please fight for our local workers and our union workers. Now I do have to address what I witnessed. I am aghast  that the city attorney did what he did. For him to threaten any one of you with a misdemeanor is deplorable. I guarantee you he had a conversation with the mayor to do that. Again, two people using their positions for their own purpose, deplorable. Jim Smierka is, for all intents and purposes, the mayor's employee. He can fire him, he can hire him.  And I can see that the man would be afraid for his job. But he has no right to threaten any one of you. And for the mayor to sit up there and laugh while Michael Lynn was talking is disgusting. I have seen a council member up there who does the same thing or looks totally bored, but to have the mayor sit there and grin and laugh was disgusting. You are public servants, and I will be the first one to say that your position on city council is incorrect.  It's incredibly important. I know what you do. It's got to stop being a popularity contest. It's got to stop being the mayor stacking so that there are no checks and balances. And frankly, I am really proud of the job you guys have been doing.

In addition to that, one of the most important things there is in America is our right to know what the government is doing. No one can shut up that right. You sit there and you stand and you make a pledge of allegiance to the flag. You sit back and make a pledge of allegiance with liberty and justice. I'm speaking on two issues. Justice for all.  It suggests that the people don't know what the government is doing. That is what created this nation, the right to know. Have we forgotten that? I keep my keys around my neck because I lose them sometimes, forget where I place them. But I know the first amendment to the United States constitution. I assume most of you are college educated.  So I know that you know it too. Because they drum it into us from the time we are children. They eliminated the pledge of allegiance to the flag. I eliminated it in the 60s when I realized I did not have liberty or justice. I am a black man. We have returning citizens don't have the right for a place to live. And we're tolerating that.  Now I come in here and I don't have the right to know what wrongs the government is doing? This is Lansing. I can remember what was drummed into me that created the Boston Tea Party.

I see in the media that the mayor is happy to say we've done better with our bonding and therefore the public safety millage will be reduced some. I say good. Anything's better than nothing. But we're talking for the average homeowner.  We're talking about a Starbucks cup of coffee a year difference in price. So let's not toot this horn too very loudly just yet. Going along with that, there's a lot of talk again about the idea of selling City Hall, remodeling City Hall, what to do about City Hall. I am still not in favor of selling City Hall. I am still in favor of consolidating floors down to the necessary amount.  for the current crew that works here and using the additional floors above that to convert to penthouse suites. I mean, this is the prime piece of property in the city of Lansing. And even if the decision is to go with somebody like the current developer who's admitted he wants another bite at the apple, it could be incorporated into a hotel.  There are a lot of hotels in places like New York, Chicago, San Francisco, where there's several floors of rooms available for the tourist and other trade rent. And then there are penthouse suites on top of those rental floors. So it's not an impossibility to make a combination project where we would use the space that's currently occupied by LPD, which will be vacant.  And we can use that area for a doorman, for a concierge setup, for dedicated elevators. There could be a floor for a library, a floor for a gym, a conference room, a community room used for events, for public or private events for the residents.  Dedicated elevators, dedicated underground parking. We have to start thinking about these kinds of things outside of the box and looking for solutions different than the same old rehashed issues over and over again. And speaking of rehash.  I would like to advise the mayor to revert back to his position in the prior elections where he did not endorse any candidates for city council. I think with the brouhaha that has taken place, it's almost reached a level, if it hasn't passed that level, where his endorsement may actually backfire and cost a candidate some vote. So I would advise him to refrain from endorsing anyone else.  and for endorsing the rest of this campaign and revert back to his previous stance. Thank you.",Urban Development

My name's Scott Cobb and for it has been brought to my attention, the atrocities that have been perpetrated against the poor and the homeless of the city for they are told they cannot be here nor there, but given no other opportunity in which to go.  for the shelters are full and they're left outside to survive whatever the weather may be. But there are many abandoned apartment complexes, buildings and red tag homes that could give them protection that they seek and desperately need and deserve. For how is it that we have laws and for animal cruelty, leaving pets outside in the elements, but we turn a blind eye to the inhumane way we treat our fellow brothers and sisters.  For the Lord God said, for he that hath an eareth to hear, let him hear, and he that forbeareth, let him forbear. For God is in control, and for God himself has placed a burden upon these poor and the homeless to test each and every one of us to do what is right in the sight of our Heavenly Father. In Acts 20, 35, Jesus states, for I have showed you all things, how that laboring ye ought to support the weak and remember the words of the Lord Jesus. How is it more?  how it is more blessed to give than to receive. In 1 Peter 4, 8, and above all things, have fervent charity among yourselves, for charity will cover a multitude of sins.  For the Father will judge each and every one of us according to the works and how we treat and support the least of our brethren. For in 1 Timothy 6, 18 and 19 states, they that do good works ready to distribute, willing to communicate, laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come.  that they may lay hold of eternal life. For this issue is soon to get far worse than you can imagine, for we are about to enter the great tribulation. With inflation on the rise, more and more will be forced out of their homes and into the streets. For Proverbs 14, 31 clearly states, he that oprethes the poor reproaches his maker, but he that honoreth him has mercy on the poor. For in Luke,  418, the spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has anointed me to preach to the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering the sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised. For Proverbs 21, 13 clearly states, if a man shuts his ears to the cry of the poor, he too will cry out and not be answered.  For he that layeth up treasures for himself is not rich towards God. For I call upon each and every one of you here today, and those who may hear these words later, to open up your hearts and do what is right in the sight of our Father in heaven, to help all those who are in need of food and shelter, for this is God's will of each and every one of us.

I wanted to talk a little bit more about the public hearing that was just set on the changes to the HRCS board's duties. And I just want to again acknowledge that the changes, again, they have a very, very real potential to completely take away any ability for the community to have a  somewhat objective and community-based route for addressing these kinds of issues and complaints. So if the goal, and it should have been when the review was done, but it absolutely should be now, is to maintain the relevance, the effectiveness, and the impact of this board to address community needs and concerns, then there would have been clear efforts in those proposed revisions, especially regarding the discrimination, the prejudice, things like that,  to focus on preserving that board's purpose of providing guidance, recommendations, and support to the community. But most importantly, they also provide us the liaison between that kind of support guidance from community, from us to you all.  So that's extremely important and it does not seem that there was a concerted effort. So we now look to you by way of this public hearing because you are the balance that we need to be able to count on to thoroughly review every single aspect of every change.  because the implications as they are are very concerning. So that is where we're looking to you to, again, it's not like an up-down type situation. It should be a very thorough review of what those changes are, how they came about, why they came about, and what implications they have on the very existence of this board.  I wanted to talk a little bit about the incident that just happened because, I mean, as we all know, people have already talked about this. This was not a one-off issue. We have got to stop pretending like it is. We've got to stop with this Lansing is not as bad mindset because we understand that between 2019 and now, we had a 16-year-old girl that was struck 17 times in the thigh in 20 seconds.  That video went viral. That made the national news. Anthony Hulan was murdered by LPD on the floor of the jail in this building, you know, screaming that he couldn't breathe. That same year, a man was beaten on Baker Street that ultimately was the victim of a fight that had happened, and LPD had to fire an officer for being unprofessional, aggressive, and because he escalated the situation, causing other officers to use higher levels of force.  Just the beginning of this year, a 35-year-old man was shot and killed by LPD. So we've had a lot of dangerous situations. We've had a lot of dangerous chases. We have videos of rights being violated, stop-and-frisk situations. We understand that these are not one-off situations, but we continue to value the PR nature of the way that we govern the city, and this is what we get. And it's only going to get worse because we value how we look more than how we actually are.",Police Reform

You are blessed or cursed with my presence here tonight because of a city manager in Escanaba, Michigan. Escanaba is a lot like Lansing in a way because it owns its own utility. It's the shopping district for miles and miles around.  There's a grand total of 14,000 people in Escamaba, slightly smaller, like maybe 10% of the population in Lansing. It only operates in one county and obviously Lansing occupies three counties. So I don't envy Mr. Svirka there trying to look at a city charter that hasn't been changed in what, 24 years now?  because it's been amended a few times since then. And you got to follow through all of the different changes to figure out what the heck does that say now? And how many other changes do we have to make? We have a choice. And a lot of the things that came up tonight at the committee, the whole meeting and items 25 to 26 through 29 have a lot to do with the vote on the city charter coming up in November. And based on my experience and the way Jim Houser ran it as a city manager,  He would take the kind of people who come to your constituent services coffees and he'd talk to us. I was the only one who showed up at city council meetings because they don't have a university up there. They don't have nice lectures and they didn't have an orchestra or an opera or any of those things that I really liked back in New York State where I came from.

And on the whole, I think they sound pretty good. I think that most of them I could probably support pretty well. One concern I have is to talk about a building being taller than the Comerica Bank building. If memory serves me, and I could be wrong here, but if memory serves me, there is a restriction  on heights in buildings within a zone around the Capitol that would prohibit anything tall enough to block the view of the Capitol from any direction. So I think that it would behoove whoever's going to be pursuing this opportunity to look at that and see if that restriction is still in place and would it impact these buildings. The other thing I found interesting was these builders, this developer was talking about penthouses.  concierge services, dedicated spaces for meetings and events, and a library and a convenience store on site. And I'm just wondering, you know, where have we heard those suggestions before? Did we hear them in pertaining to City Hall?  From this dais, perhaps we did, if people were listening. Second, the person who presented tonight for the Unity House, I think that sounds again like a good idea. I have two thoughts though, off the top of my head. Nobody discussed parking. And I'm not certain that that neighborhood area can support $50,000 income jobs. So those should be things that get examined a little bit more closely.  Also, I'm going to continue to harp on the idea that we did not know we were approving moving a fire station to the new SWAC location. So if there's any potential for reversing that decision, I'm going to continue to bring that to your attention right up to the last possible minute. Thank you.",Urban Development

That's correct. The police were there at the wrong place at the wrong time. And you know who else was there at the wrong time in the wrong place?  the knee on Anthony Hulon's neck, who died here in this jail in 2020, months before George Floyd died, or I'm sorry, was murdered. And then when that protest was happening, we saw Andy Schor with the knee down and a fist up, knowing that he covered up that murder. And so I just am like deeply, deeply disturbed. And also just how embarrassing that this is why Lansing was in the news.  I'm just beside myself. And as a white person, I get to walk around without that fear. And I'm glad that you acknowledge the trauma, because that's true, but you need to do the work to acknowledge the trauma of our city. This is not a one-off incident. It's not.

However, I just want to point to this program that's in Portland that is universally loved among the variety of citizens, including the police and citizens across political spectrum. It's called Cahoots. It is in Portland, Oregon. It is a great program that is often used in reference to defunding the police or whatnot. I would highly recommend you look into it, but this is a systemic issue and not a one-off.  And so I would just encourage you to remember Anthony Huon, who died in the jail underneath the city hall in 2020. And you, city attorney, are the person who told people they couldn't talk about it.

I'm going to start this by saying I am the wife of a retired state police officer. My husband gave 31 years of his life to the police department. So I have the absolute utmost respect for police officers. And I know firsthand the underbelly of society that my husband had to endure and that he still suffers from today. It affects their health. It affects their families. So I'm beginning that by saying  He gave 31 years of his life, and yes, he was a black police officer. Having said that, I am mortified with what happened with that 12-year-old child in our city. There was absolutely no excuse for that. He was crying. His father was there. He did not need to be cuffed, and he certainly did not need to be placed in the back of a police car. They could have stood there peacefully with the father who was advocating for his child  and that child and waited for that officer to show up and just say, he's not the kid. I can't even imagine that a social worker is going to get this child over it. And I will tell you, over 20 years ago, our brown child could not drive the streets after 10 o'clock without getting pulled over.  Our brown child was pulled out of his car, not once, but twice by gunpoint. Our brown child could not come through a parking ramp in East Lansing without being pulled over. We had to tell him that he had to call us every single time he got stopped by the police because he was treated horrifically because he was brown and he was young.  And I am horrified that in the past 20 plus years, there has been no difference. And I would dare say some would say in the past 200 years, we are still seeing the same thing. It's got to change. We have to have smart programs. We have to stop the microaggressions. We have to stop the discrimination. We need to get this together. Our children are dying. Our children are being profiled. Enough is enough.  And as I said, I have the utmost respect for police officers, but this has got to stop. And this HRCS killing of the entire advisory board is just another step in that direction. It was the only safeguard we had to discrimination, and I am the reason  that you are reviewing it. Because when I read the ordinance, I saw the teeth that we had to protect people. And when I brought that forward, now it's all being pulled off. And Joe Abboud literally had the nerve to come to one of our meetings with the changed ordinance and said, this is effective immediately. He never had the authority to do that.

I was at the city operations meeting this afternoon where Mark spoke about the chip sealing catastrophe and what they're going to do. His list of the streets with damage was very short. As a matter of fact, Mr. Garza's area was not on that list. He texted me as I was sitting here tonight saying, well, Andy knows. Andy knows that my area is bad, so they're going to do it.  And I reassured him, well, you weren't on the list.  And there's a lot of streets that weren't on that list. There's a lot of streets in my neighborhood that weren't on that list. Not necessarily on my side of MLK, but Lorain and a few streets closer to Pleasant Grove. All real bad. So, you know, I hope people call in and I hope you'll look at that before you comprise your final list of people that are calling O&M and complaining about that. So they're included at least for looking at what they got.  Andy spoke tonight about the compost and stuff, and I want to tell you something Those seasonal positions a lot of people don't know this it's kind of a hidden secret But those compost seasonals they made forty to fifty thousand dollars a year remember one made fifty four thousand dollars a year and  or one year with the overtime in the fall. And the reason that they're leaving is, like you said, they pay more at McDonald's, but they don't pay more at McDonald's when they're doing the job that they was hired for. They're only paid that when they're not on the compost job. So if you knock that down to 50%,  There's part of your problem. It's an invented situation. They're doing this willfully, in my opinion. And that's why you can't get anybody. Because they take them off of that truck. They take them out of the routes. They pay them $13 an hour instead of the $22. But when you add up the $54,000 a year, $40,000 a year that those seasonals were making, that's a little bit of money.  It's not the wages you would make on 13 bucks an hour. So there's quite a bit of money there. And like you said, you got a full-timer on there now. Well, who's doing his job? Because he's not from the refuse or recycle or compost department. He's from another entity, another part of the public service department. I know who he is. I've talked to him bi-weekly now.  But also the issue of the odor. 1206, your ordinance can't exceed the property lines. You get 15, 20 bags of moldy stuff, and you'd have to put it in the middle of your yard not to smell it at the property lines. So you're forcing people to be in violation of your own ordinance.  This whole thing is bad. You can't go back and hire them jobs and do that work. So that money that wasn't used unless it was intended, you can't go back and do that. That's our money.

I'm here specifically to talk about the mayor's leadership fund email that he was they sent a few weeks ago. I am  I've spoken about this before, but I'll say this again. What the mayor did with the whole email thing and the endorsement thing, well, there's nothing illegal about endorsements. It was clearly unethical of him to use that email in such a way. And also, it just, what's a better way of saying it? It just showed his favoritism towards some candidates over others, is all I'm saying.  And to say this about email, it was very reprehensible for him to do that. And the fact that his previous email, he used a logo that looked identical to the city logo, that's basically just appropriating a government symbol for your organization is just  That's just reprehensible in all of them. And jury's out on whether or not he actually used city funds to start his leadership fund. If he did, that is a clear violation of state law, since I'm pretty sure state law forbids that, and it's also probably a violation of federal law. And I know that the Department of Justice has already got him a few times, so that  So I wonder if that's going to, they're going to get him again on that. And adding on to that, that incidents where someone was wrongfully arrested just because they happened to wear the same clothing as the suspect, or at least identical clothing,  Weird he has to apologize for that when similar incidents where people who have also been arrested on flimsy charges  They, of course, he, I don't think he's ever apologized for that. I don't, he's never really made a statement for that. So for him to apologize for this incident now when he's had a history of that is just mind boggling. And this shows that he's very corrupt.

I want to address two things tonight, one being the entertainment business that's on Logan Square.  You know, we've had over 300 shootings in the city. Um, many of those shootings have taken place in front of businesses, near businesses. And now one time to this mayor or the city attorney or the city council have, have suggested to go off to those businesses. And the fact that you guys are going after a black owned business, um, is very shameful. Um, especially when you know that we've had 300 shootings in the city. Um, that's one two.  our police department. Andy, it's not just one individual, one child that was traumatized this past few days. It's an entire city. On that day, if you were wearing a white shirt and green shorts, you are a target, especially if you're a black person. It could have been me. It could have been Jeff, Mr. Brown. It could have been Brian. It could have been Michael Lynn. It could have been anybody.  Your police officers were looking for an adult, but they ended up handcuffing a child. How does that make sense? As a grown man, as a father, how does that make sense to you? That the suspect is an adult, but they ended up handcuffing a child. And for your police department to say that it was at the wrong place at the wrong time, where is the right place for black people in this city? This child was taking out trash from his house.  Where is the right place for us? Why is that always an excuse for your police department? Wrong place, wrong time, a mistake. It's not a mistake. We're hiring adults to protect the city, to serve the city. And if they can't differentiate between an adult and a child, maybe they don't need a gun.  They don't need a gun. A lot of people have died under your watch, Andy. A lot of shootings have taken place since you became mayor. 300 this year. Over close to a dozen people that have been killed. Last year, over 20 people. The year before that, another 20 people.  The only reason why you're going after this Black-owned business is because we made CNN and NBC. And the only reason why your police department and you are apologizing for what happened to this Black child is because you guys made CNN. Good morning, America. The entire country is talking about you. We've been trying to warn you about this whole situation for years, and you've ignored us. Now we've made national news. Lansing is on the map.  Like we have the spotlight on us, but for the wrong reason. I hope you're proud.

Today is now the 14th, so I believe they're way past their deadline, even with 10 business days in there.  I called today and talked to Matthew Staples. He told me, I'm working on it. And you can go through the process of appealing if you need more time, or if you want to get it. I don't know what it... The point is, why do I have to go through that? Why is it okay for the city to just violate rights, things that are written in law, constitutional rights, just repeatedly, and then I have to go through a process? I want the FOIA request when it was due. They asked for a 10-day extension, they got it.  They asked for what they asked for, I gave it to them. Money, whatever the case was. I want the FOIA, like, tomorrow. And I think that you guys can press that issue. Secondary to that, when we talk about violation of constitutional rights, they've been being violated for years now. And I've been really receiving all of these complaints of Fourth Amendment violations, due process violations, and all of these different things I've been receiving. And people ask, why don't we go and make complaints? But who do they make complaints to now? Because the person who was receiving the complaints is now the HR.  CS, deputy director. So that's just how things move. Like as soon as we get to a point where we're like, okay, we're going to start making complaints. And I've sent people to that woman and she was as rude as any cop that's came up to you on the streets. I've called her and she's been as rude to me.  So the complaint process is just terrible. Again, why HRCS is having that complaint position in place is correct and needed. But what I want to get to is last week they did a press conference and the mayor stood up in tough on crime conversation and talked about how Lansing is no different from everywhere else. If you do this or that or whatever the case is and brought this whole thing because he was called out on social media about the gun violence.  And then our county attorney stood up and said, if you're 13 years old in this city, we will arrest you. We will charge you as an adult. And then we wonder why a 12-year-old gets yanked up like an adult in the streets. This is what you guys are telling the police department. This is what the police chief sat up there and said, if you want to lambast us in the media, and you want to talk about us for political fame and all of these different things, why don't you join us? How nasty that was, sitting right next to his boss.  How is that helping community relations? Then when y'all snatch up a kid, then we say community relations are our top number one goal. How is that? When just a week prior to that, she was telling everybody, you're a kid. Now, I was sitting there watching that. And I got my youngest is 20 years old. And I was thinking, damn, to be a parent of a 13-year-old kid when the county prosecutor stands there, the police chief stands there, and the mayor says, we don't care. We charge your kid as a dog. They going to prison. This is what's being told to the police officers out here.  I'm sure their roll call tells you anybody that looks like this is a danger. We got kids killing kids out here. We all recognize that. But everybody, this is 112,000 people in this city. We're talking about maybe 20 people out here committing violent crimes. And we're setting a precedence for the whole entire black community that they're all criminals and drug dealers and killers. That's scary as hell.  But the fact that we just are able to violate rights the way that we do without any type of accountability is crazy to me. So much more to be said, but thank you.",Police Reform

I do want to talk briefly about how a lot of times issues with spot zoning are because The city has tons of different types of zones nitty-gritty details with differentiating as you said the area around it appears to with their  It appears to fit the area just fine. A lot of our zones got way, way too into detail on things where they really don't need to be, and it's just needlessly restrictive. Zones that we have, I think, seven different single family zones, and each one specifies slightly different lot sizes.  Actually, if you look back through the history of zoning in the United States, one of the first cities to largely implement zoning differences was the city of Los Angeles, where they implemented bans on dry cleaners specifically to, for essentially discourage Asian Americans from living in specific places in the city. Zoning has always had these nitty gritty issues in them for discriminatory reasons.  Nowadays, you don't think about it like that, but we're looking back through the history is basically just unchanged. Going back to that. That one reliance is residential zones. The are one zone was originally created for. I believe it was Bakersfield, California to prohibit a black dance hall from being built in a neighborhood. And the zoning code in our books today is still nearly identical to that code way back then.  Obviously, we're not building dance halls too often nowadays. But the point still stands that we wouldn't be having these spot zone issues coming up if we just looked through the zoning code and said, do we actually need to have residential type 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6A and 6B in addition to all these other things?

First of all, I want to say I'm looking forward to bringing my 1956 Thunderbird to the collision guys on South Cedar Street. So I'm excited about that. Second thing, I just want you to know there's a big need in our community, and you know it's shelter. And the City Rescue Mission of Lansing has been around since 1911.  On Thursday night, we sheltered 263 men, women, and children during that storm. And that's what we do every single day. But we're at capacity right now. So for the past two years, we've been looking at ways to expand and meet that need. This is probably the fourth or fifth piece of property we looked at. And I feel like it's the best location. We've always told you, I'll go where the need is. And I think the need is in that area. It's the best way for our citizens to get back out of homelessness, to get to work, get out of homelessness into housing.  Is in this location. I think collectively will do a great job to make that happen there. So we'll go from about 100 men to 200 men. About 50 single adult women to about 100 adult women. And they'll also have free access additional capacity on South Cedar Street for more families.  So collectively, we'll go from about 263 to 450 to 500 people. Now we're funded by our community. So since 1911, we received gifts from God's people in our community, so we don't receive any federal, no state, no city funding. It all comes from  the citizens that support the Lansing area. So we provide services for Ingham, Clinton, and Eaton County, but we are the largest shelter in mid-Michigan. So I believe we have the capacity to expand, but we need your help to make that happen. So I just want to thank you for at least taking that next step to bring it to public hearing. So we're looking for your support. And yeah, I have my contact information.

But I am here to put you all on notice here tonight, for I hope that you will do not try to stop me from spreading this message.  if it goes beyond the allotted three minutes, for you cannot stop the truth of the gospel of Jesus Christ our Lord and Savior to be spoken at any time. For if it be of God's will that you do try to stop me and have me arrested for misconduct or disrupting the peace, let it be done. For I will gladly be placed under arrest for his name's sake, and I will continue preaching even as I'm being taken away, awaiting trial for false accusations placed upon me.  For if it be of God's will, no evil will come against me here tonight, and you will allow me to finish this speech, let it be done. For if it is God's will and evil does come against me here tonight, that he will smite down any one of you that oppose me and clear my path of all evildoers that stand in my way.  For no matter the outcome, just remember, his will will be done, and you have no power or authority over his decision. But be forewarned, for he will lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For you may want to hold your peace here before him tonight, for I will get straight to my point and not waste your time, for the truth must be spoken here tonight. For anyone here that wishes to tempt him,  is not for him, but against him. For choose wisely of your decision, for the regret could last you an eternity. For the Lord God said, he that have an eareth to hear, let him hear, and he that forbeareth, let him forbear. For the gospel clearly states that we are to swear no oath unto no one. For your answer shall be, yea, yea, or nay, nay. For anything more cometh evil.  For all of you here, you have sworn an oath unto man to hold the positions in which you are currently serving, to gain power and control over your fellow brothers and sisters, hiding behind a veil of darkness, perpetuating the evil that cometh from it.  But be forewarned, your Heavenly Father can see right through that veil of darkness to which you choose to hide behind, for He sees and knows of all things. For the ways of man are to oppress those that are in need of help and to hold back the resources available unto them.  For every man has a deceitful heart to retain their wealth unto themselves in defiance of God's will. For even if you choose to walk away from hearing this message, be forewarned. You can run, but you can't hide, for no one can escape judgment day, which is to soon come upon us all. For a good watchman knows the season in which we are in, and must warn others of things to come.  For I ask each and every one of you here today, are you going to continue hiding behind the veil of darkness, upholding your oath unto man's perpetuating the evil that cometh from it? Or are you going to turn away from your evil ways and do that which is right of your heavenly Father? For if you fear God, you will fear man. But if you fear man, you will fear God.

As an atheist myself, I'm certainly above stuff like that. I know I'm getting a little off topic, but still. Anyways, to say this about what I am going to say is this whole thing with the  that the execs were trying to do with the HRCS. Honestly, I don't know how I feel about it being just pushed back to the committee of the whole. On one hand, I do think that, yes, this meeting has gone for quite long enough, and I do think that it should be discussed at a later date.  But also I think this should, I do understand why I think this should have been struck down immediately because I mean, to say this again with the whole conform with the city charter thing, considering that the city charter is gonna be on the ballot, this is just really ill-timed and I don't know if there was any time to strip any board of any kind of their powers in any way. This is just,  This is basically just, um, abuse of power in almost every single way. And it's just a blatant power grab. And to say this again about the city charter, the state charter is a living, breathing document that citizens can vote on to change for every 12 years. And even independent of that, people can put measures on the ballot to change parts of the city charter to  changed to change the way things are. Like, let's say the organization of wards, or should we have at-large positions? Some of the things I have been pushing. Again, it's a living, breathing document that can be changed over time. And if, let's say, the people actually do vote on opening up the city charter and creating a commission, I'm wondering if these things are just going to become straight up irrelevant and are just going to age even worse.  And that's why I support opening up this H.R. And also in addition to that, I may also consider if this, should it either fail or if I, since I may fear this might fail, that I'm probably considering probably working with you council members to get something on the ballot to get rid of the at-large or reducing it and either increasing it to six wards or 2D each ward or just eight wards in general.  Either way is better than the current status quo.

You have not been able to come. And I appreciated the comments that you made tonight and the questions that you asked. Very valid, very important, very valuable. And it's also important for you to go to the ones, the Ad Hoc Committee on Homelessness, because you are committed to do the things that you're appointed to.  And at least at the ones that I've been able to attend, they haven't had a quorum so they couldn't approve the minutes or anything else. So you missed a lot of really important discussions because they've been doing a good job trying to cope without a quorum and having good presentations, valuable presentations. And I also want to thank Council President Carol Wood because you spoke from the heart and you held our mayor's feet to the fire. And we needed that to happen.  Because when we don't have a city charter that has the mayor just doing ceremonial things like ribbon cuttings and smiling and shaking hands and going around. Actually, Mayor Schor is very good at that kind of job, but there's a lot more in managing a city. And when you put a politician in charge of managing the city, you get what we got, garbage.  He's been bought and sold by the economic development people, as if the people of counseling don't matter at all. And that's wrong. That's unethical, and it won't happen with a city manager who is sworn to an ethical code. And I personally will be grateful when our city attorney retires, because I'm not an ageist, but you do seem to be operating on some very old-fashioned rules.

And they're going to have a public hearing on public meeting to report on the progress of their grant. They're 10 months into an 18-months grant.  And it's time that the city of Lansing knows about the wonderful work that they're doing based on evidence-based practices. And their goal is to end circulatory and retaliatory gun violence. I think we all want that. I think we all need that. So find out how they're managing to do that, at least according to the data that they've already had. And it's already on the website. You can look at it month by month.  And I want to point out that I'm a member of a condo association and we're billed taxes twice because we have to pay to our condo association who manages all of the trash collection and all the recycling and all the tree management.

In Florida, when there was a hurricane, my father was trapped in. Every school, every area that could be open was open for people to come.  and get a bed, warm meal, whatever they need in the bathroom.

With that being stated, and it sucks because this just happened, but the police presence in response to this room is starting to get pretty racist, in my opinion.  I was in this room over the week for a public hearing. There was about 16 people in here listening to that public hearing. And at first DK security was up here for about five minutes and then somebody called the police literally and there was five police in here. It was a quiet standing. Nobody's ever showed up here and done any of this.  Right? So like I don't understand the police response. I don't understand why we have three police sitting back here waiting on whatever to happen. And every week nothing happens. And they could be out on the roads because everybody's talking about we don't have enough police. We don't have enough police. This was 1 o'clock p.m. I believe it was Tuesday. And there was five police sitting back here for 15 people back here. And the only thing that I could come up with is that everybody here was black. Five police. I asked the police officers why they're here. They said we got called here. For what? What's the call come in as?  We have a disturbance. We have black people in this room.

I know that was something that got passed. Please do that. Aside from that, First Amendment violations, the mayor has repeatedly untagged himself, or Scott Bean has, from anything posted on social media he doesn't like. And the city of Lansing's Facebook page, which I've done a little research. Case law states that you guys cannot, even on social media, change what I posted or what I write. There's case law on this. So again, you guys open yourselves up for just some lawyer to want to take this case. And here we go again.  The mayor posted when he changed his stuff over there from now on all city related posts will be through Facebook Andy sure if you want to tag me on anything city related whether you're excited about something or have complaints about something you can tag me using that City's email our city's Facebook page, but if you to put anything negative he takes it off.

He sat right here and reported it to you. And he sat right here and told you just the opposite. So I don't know how that's going to happen. But I want to go on about this compost. When he was down here at the last big meeting and you had him, he did nothing but collaborate everything I said. Everything. You don't have the employees. You're pulling employees from other areas.  You're taking the money and you're putting it in an account. You've got more money than should be in there. And why? Because the services aren't being provided. That's the only way there could be extra money in that account, is if services weren't being provided. Nobody mentioned the sweeping. Nobody mentioned the catch basin cleaning. Nobody mentioned the leaf cleanup in the fall.  None of that was mentioned. And everything, like I said, everything he said, the trucks, he said that the trucks, there's money in the fund to replace two trucks every two years. And then he told you the trucks are 21 years old.  How does that happen if you got the money to replace trucks every two years? How do you ever get a 21-year-old truck? By not doing the things that the fee pays for. It's fraud, and it is blatant. It is blatant fraud. I just was in a court case today for commingling of funds, and that's what you're doing. You're commingling those funds, and you need to reevaluate the recycle fee for the actual cost. He didn't go over any of that.  He smoke-screened all the way around it, just like he sat here and smoke-screened his way right through this whole storm disaster. And the mayor, he didn't mention the City of Lansing employees when he thanked the responders. Why? Because he only had 11 of them working. The forestry crew, seven guys, and four truck drivers. That's why. Every available resource, hardly, hardly.  And Peter, I want to ask you, you had a meeting today. I was at a meeting a couple weeks ago, and Mark was asked to contact Meridian Township, ask them why they road milled and about their chip sealing catastrophe, and that he would report back to you. As far as I understand, that report is still forthcoming. Also, September is right here at the end of the week. Still no door hangers, information on what they're doing with the chip sealing.

Thank you. First off, I want to say I have been in this city for 50 years. I came here in 73, and I ran away from home when I was 13. And I lived out on my own and came here after I graduated from high school at 17. And I've been in Lansing now, like I said, for 50 years. And some of the things that I have done in this city with the help of my good friend Jean Macklin, rest her soul, I  struggled as a young person, and my whole life has been about the youth. When I ran away from home, my mother couldn't tell me nothing because I was 13 and I knew everything. Came here, did a lot of things, implemented smoke-free campuses for the hospitals, Gene, Macklin, and I. Thirdly, I have an issue with our youth today. I was a youth.  And the problem is that our youth have nowhere and nobody to turn to. I didn't have nobody to turn to when I was out here on my own. And I came to this city with no kin people, nobody. But I say this to you all tonight. I put a challenge before you for our mental health youth.  Is there any reason, and I challenge all of you tonight, including the mayor, and he's not here right now. Is there any reason why we can't utilize St. Lawrence Hospital as a youth place for all of our youngsters right now that are having problems? I challenge any of you to take me on to help me because I know how to go about getting things done.  And our youth today, we're losing them. And we're losing them at a rate that we have no control. So if we can't get in contact with Sparrow, use St. Lawrence to do what we need to do with our youth, it'll make us a better place. Now, the reason I'm really here, and I only got a minute left, is my trees. Now, I came here about a month ago and asked you that, yet, y'all own the trees, but y'all left me with the stump.  And I just walked out because I knew that it was funny to everybody, but it's not funny to me because I have a problem with knowing that I'm a landscaper.  If you look at the folders that I gave each and every one of you, I showed you what I did with the city when they came out and cut my tree down. I made it look gorgeous. But also, I was able to take the tree that came down Saturday, if you look at the pictures  and pass them around. The last two trees that you're looking at are the two that failed this year, as you can see how I decorated them. All I would encourage you all to do, we have a whole bunch of landscaping people in this city. Why not contract them to teach all of us and share how we can make our stumps look beautiful and not just lean. Thank you. Thank you, sir.",Education and Youth Services

So I'm going to start by saying I know all the powers and all for everyone just yet. My name is Jay West. I'm the current Churchill Down Community Association president. Last Thursday, August 24, a tornado ripped through Ingham County. And it devastated a number of neighborhoods, including mine. Upon initial assessment, I wasn't able to clearly put my thoughts together, let alone words. The devastation throughout the Churchill Down neighborhood is shocking and frequent.  Every other turn there's another tree down, a power line down. Trees and power lines on roads as well as on people's houses. I have been a Churchill Down resident for 10 years and I have never seen this neighborhood come together like we have and continue to do so in the midst of Mother Nature showing us her ugly head.  Neighbors making makeshift charging stations for all to use, neighbors passing out food and water and ice, neighbors making food runs to make sure everyone had something to eat, neighbors helping each other with yard cleanup and just interacting with one another assessing the damage.  I want to publicly thank Adam Hussain who shared multiple updates in state and communication throughout the entire weekend and continue to do so. When I say thank you to Adam Hussain, what I'm saying is there was a resident that needed electricity for oxygen. He actually mitigated that issue, I believe it was Friday, so he got things done. I also want to say thank you to Councilman Jeffrey Brown.  He contacted me Thursday night to check on me and our residents, as well as through the weekend. So thank you guys. Sorry, I'm kind of nervous. That's okay. All right. So I was, I was initially concerned that being on the South side, we would be forgotten, but that did not happen. Publicly think the mayor for emergency have happened, especially on campus.  I wanna CW all the police and fire know there were many from out of us get resolved, but violence has. So, um, please, different thing. One thing we saw, but we have you guys up there.",General Community Organizing

I was at Brian Jackson's constituent meeting last Saturday and he's right, the food's good and the conversation is good. But I believe the time has come for the city of Lansing to change the practice of its key city leader and administrator. We need to change to a city manager form of government and leadership. Advantages to a city manager form of government include  Neighborhoods strengthening their voice, the power of special interests is diffused, and we can have more merit-based decision-making versus politics. Furthermore, the city manager form balances the power structure within the city council with the city manager directly accountable to them.  And it creates a more of a partnership with the city council and provides more consistent leadership for years to come. These Michigan cities have city managers, Grand Rapids, Kalamazoo, Wyoming, East Lansing and Ann Arbor. These are medium sized cities that benefit from a city manager. Now, there is a process to move forward. I understand this would require a change in the city of Lansing charter with both legislative and voter approval.  Therefore, I am in favor of a review of the city charter as a step in this process.",Governance and Civic Engagement

There are two things I wish to address tonight. First, the ethics question regarding our current mayor. I firmly believe that a special attorney should be hired by the council and that that individual should make recommendations to the council on any ethics questions relating to the mayor. Frankly, I don't trust the city  to make any recommendations in relationship to someone who he reports to. That makes no sense to me. It just isn't even logical. Secondly, I would like to address the emergency situation. And here I'm talking about someone who was the recipient of the services in terms of that emergency situation. And believe me, I'm not the only one that feels this way.  Handling of the recent emergency situation in Lansing has been unsatisfactory, at least from someone who has to receive the services here. I'd like to point out that no provisions appear to have been made for the homeless.  No provisions were made for people needing assistance. No provisions were made to ensure people could recharge their phones. And this is quite serious. I spent an enormous number of hours in my car trying to recharge my phone so I could call somebody. Yet there is no place that you have set up appropriate call centers so anybody can go in and recharge their electrical equipment.  One, no provisions were made regarding fresh water in terms of that. Now, the BWL app was, at best, poor. No provisions existed in terms of you being able to determine any progress that could be made, if you could actually read the app in terms of that. I thought that was one of the worst apps I had ever seen in relationship. Now, I would like to state this.  that your offers of condolences to those who have paid the ultimate price, they fall on hollow ears with me. Why you do not have, the city does not have an emergency plan is beyond my comprehension. Why don't we have one? This is ridiculous. I mean, we had that big ice storm where I had to literally leave and go to North Carolina for five days. Here, if it had been winter, the situation would have been drastic.  in terms of what was happening. I hope that you will develop an emergency plan and not have this piecemeal type of information that I heard this evening come up. It makes no sense that there is no emergency plan. You don't have one and you need one. Thank you.",Public Safety and Law Enforcement

First of all, I would like to say, uh, uh, God bless all the victims of nine 11, but I would like to also say how hideous the park looked down there.  Grass was over their ankles. I mean, it was terrible. Needed to be weed whipped, two foot high weeds. That doesn't, that doesn't, the optics of that are terrible, terrible. But what I want to speak about is what the chief said about the sirens and them not working. And you're putting everybody in this city at risk. Look what happened in Maui, Camp Fire, Paradise Fire, other natural disasters.  Without a warning system, you're asking for catastrophic injuries and destruction. That just amazes me that that's been going on for a year and a half and we didn't know. He said this is an ongoing issue for a year and a half. What neighborhoods are in jeopardy? Do we have to wait for a tornado to come through?  and level the neighborhood to find out if that's one of them that doesn't have an alarm like Jeremy's neighborhood. And for his excuse to say that the winds were traveling in a direction, you cannot predict where a tornado was going to go or the trail. The drone footage of the one that went through Perry should tell you that. It swerved from side to side for miles. They could be miles wide.  That's ridiculous. What sirens don't work? What neighborhoods are in jeopardy? We have a right to know. So when adverse things happen, we can shelter our families and our loved ones. That's ridiculous. And it's absolutely unacceptable in my mind. And I would like to say the chip ceiling. It was going to be spring. It was going to be August.  Then it was going to be September. We got a mailing saying it was going to be the week of September 5th, September 11th. Nothing's been done. Haven't heard anything. Haven't seen anything. The storm cleanup hasn't been done in the neighborhood. And with that said, you see now where the six seasonals would be absolutely be able to be used in this storm cleanup. And for you to say, for Andy to say that the  The compost seasonals will be utilized for the cleanup. There are none still. We've been paying for that since spring. We've been paying for six positions. Everybody in here, every property owner in the city has been paying for that. And we don't have any of them. And that's ridiculous. That is fraud. Like I say, week in and week out. And I'll keep saying it until you get it. And you all know  You all know that, and you all approved the raise in the fee, knowing that, and knowing that the services aren't being done, knowing that the sweeping's not being done, knowing that they're not buying the trucks, knowing that they're not filling the catch, or getting the catch basins, or filling the positions.",Public Safety and Law Enforcement

The report on cooling and warming centers to my thinking, if we're going to need warming centers because it's too cold out, it's cold during the daytime and it's cold at night. And if we're going to need cooling centers because it's too hot out, it's hot during the day and it's hot at night as well. People that don't have air conditioning can't cool their houses at night by opening windows if there's no breeze.  So we need to look at providing 24-7 coverage when the conditions permit or are required. They aren't required 800 days or 800 hours or 500 hours or whatever a year. You might have a total of, say, between the two, you might have at the most maybe 45 days where you need to provide heating or cooling to the people who are in need of that service.  We have community centers. All four of them from each ward could be utilized. They're already open during the daytime. They're already staffed. They're already utilitied. It's not a question of needing to come in and provide a whole new facility or a different location for them. Use the facilities you have, the staff you have, the utilities you're already paying for, and just keep them open at night when the requirement is there.  And then on the stump grinding, I would hope that by now we've learned after going through this process of outsourcing the mowing and the weed whacking to companies and selling all the parks and rec equipment to do that, that it is not cost effective to go outside and that it is not gonna be a case of apples and oranges to look at having outside versus having inside if you buy the equipment.  or if you rent or lease the equipment. If you buy, rent or lease the equipment, at some point you hit a break even and you're not paying any more for that. You're only paying for labor and labor in-house is always cheaper.

I'm actually one of the technically homeless. I've been homeless for almost three years because my house flooded and code compliance just threw everything away, including my dad's ashes. Like they just came to my house because my neighbors complained  75 days in a row. I wasn't doing anything illegal. They completely put me out, got ticketed, got arrested, and everything, cleaning my own house on my own property because my neighbors bullied me out of my house because they hated me. So I go out there every day. I clean up trash. I clean up all this debris. I clean up syringes behind the homeless. No, I'm sorry, the bums, because there is a difference between homeless and bums. Homeless clean up after themselves. The bums leave these big, huge messes, and we all get lumped together. I know both sides.  The only issue is that they have no toilets, they have no showers, they have no electricity, and they have no way to cook food. So if you put, let's say, a shower next to a port-a-potty somewhere,  They wouldn't have the problem of having to use a bathroom outside in the bushes somewhere, putting God knows what into the atmosphere, because trust me, drugs do not just disappear. They come out in that way, and they are all in the water. The fish is pest-deposited for meth, what, four or five years ago? So our biggest issue is the fact that I clean up fecal matter. I clean up syringes, because there's no place to dispose of them. They just throw them everywhere.  There's not enough trash receptacles. And if we had, let's say, a year-round bathroom for them to use, it'd be a whole lot cleaner around there, because they prefer to not poop in the woods, guaranteed. Nobody likes that. The middle of the city is really busy. And it's just something small like that would make people feel less degraded. It's like they have to dig in the trash for their food already, because the businesses treat everybody like they're disgusting, like they're nothing.  And they make sure that you feel that way. Speedway specifically moved their ice machine to block their plugs so you couldn't charge your phone outside anymore. They locked their bathrooms because people go there because it's the only place they got to go and use their illicit drugs. But that's not everybody. That's one in a million. So you lock everybody out because of it. The businesses around there shun you. They make you feel like a complete garbage, especially Old Town. Like, none of us even go to Old Town anymore. And they think that it's cool that they can push everybody out.  But we're not there to cause a problem. It's like we have no other place to go. I had an $80,000 house kicked down the street because my basement flooded and my roof leaked because the inspector didn't do his job. Co-compliance, when I told them there was proof of me and my niece being assaulted in this big pile, didn't even bother to call the cops. She just said, oh, nice ironing board, and kicked me out after I let her in. I told her my dad's ashes fell off my neck. They're in this pile of debris that I can't find. They scooped him up and threw him away into this rash. That's what I got from co-compliance.  The officers didn't care. The chief of police said there was an arrest on site warrant for me because my neighbors called the cops every single day that I was there for watering my grass or putting a pole up in my yard. They didn't get in trouble for that. Because what? I have a mental disorder. I am on disability. I have bruising on both sides of my brain.

I filed, I talked about an ethics complaint that has gotten misconstrued in so many different ways and it has transformed into something that we're now just skirting responsibility at this point. So I am now formally requesting that the city council revisit the motion that you all passed on,  The opinion that was given by the city attorney's office specifically Jim smirka to seek outside counsel in reference to that opinion that was  put on the table by Council Member Spitzley. It was supported by Council Member Hussain, and it was passed unanimously seven to zero at the 7-24-23 Committee of the Whole meeting. Since that motion carried, the next step was going to be to review the outside council list and then take recommendations. But at the 8-14-23 Committee of the Whole meeting, that discussion completely derailed.  It got completely off of the tracks and it was made completely and utterly confusing by a simple question that Pat Spitzley asked pertaining to my potential ethics complaint.  That motion has nothing to do with my potential ethics complaint. So whether or not I, as a little old citizen, decide to move forward with that process should have no bearing whatsoever on you all seeking outside counsel, because as you all stated publicly in that meeting, you did not agree with that July 10th opinion by the city attorney, Jim Smirka.  The fact that question number four pertaining to that opinion was, are campaign funding communications a violation of the city's ethics ordinance? It was given a resounding no in that opinion. You all disagree with that completely, clearly. You discussed it.  but they only address the finance issues and not all of the rest of the concerns that you all talked about in front of us and discussed publicly. That should be enough to move forward with that outside council. So I would like for my potential ethics complaint to be completely separated from these discussions.

And I appreciate her separating the two, because our ethics complaint, even though all those signed by you all, is going to go to a completely different place.  What I want to say to this council is that I'm proud of you all for what you guys have been able to do. And I'm going to look at this side of the table here. I'm proud of you all for what you guys have been doing up to this point, honestly. I think that you guys are recognizing when I always talk about like having a thief in the house and your stuff just keeps coming up missing instead of just keep asking the question of why or where it's going, you're recognizing where the problem is. I've seen the back and forth, and I've seen people really trying to hold accountability.  The world is watching this. I mean, I think that's pretty apparent when the email that we're talking about soliciting funds only brought in, I think, $1,000 from a city that elected this guy twice. And then the person who was the only candidate endorsed is dropped out now. The window's tightening up. It's tightening up. It's getting really tight.  After looking through just the 256 emails that we received from the city attorney, can't even believe they actually gave us a couple of them. There's absolute ethics violations that I probably remove him from his position, but who's going to do it? That's the question. So as I'm really concerned about our timeframe here for what you guys are talking about and getting results back from this stuff before they wipe this council out and bring newbies in here. I think the city is watching it all, you all.  have got to take a concerted effort to bring accountability. If the top brass, the absolute person in the city who has the most power is not ever held accountable, you know how that floods out throughout the city. And that's the issue.  So just as if, like I said, just small things, not returning emails, not releasing a FOIA after it's been appealed and the city council president tells you to release it. These little issues like this that are right in your face, can you imagine the things that happen when it's not in your face?

Let me paint a very vivid picture for you as to how you treat your poor and the homeless here in your city. For you tell them they cannot be here nor there and give them no other opportunity in which to go. For they set up their camps in a new location each time only to have the cops show up and tell them that they have five minutes to vacate, leaving behind what little they have to escape persecution before  being forced out of what little protection in which they have from the elements. Now just imagine, Mayor and City Council members, if this were happening to you. How would that make you feel? To keep losing everything you own and to have to find another location in which to stay. For does this saying come to mind? Do unto others as you would have done unto you?  For trust me, for there is a much greater power who is going to do just that, for he is your heavenly father. For if you do not lend a helping hand to those that are in need, that hand will surely be cut off from reaching out to your heavenly father when you yourself are in your time of need. For Proverbs 21, 13 clearly states, if a man shuts his ears to the cry of the poor, he too will cry out and not be answered.  For Proverbs 14.31 clearly states, he that oppresses the poor reproaches his maker, but he that honoreth him have mercy on the poor. For Luke 14.11 clearly states, for whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased, and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.  But be not dismayed at who stands before you here tonight in the words in which he has given me to preach to you, for I know who I am. For he has chosen me for this appointed time to give you all a stern warning of the things to come.  For the Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor. He has sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering the sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised, to preach an acceptable year of the Lord. For my Father has told me, if I ask, I shall receive. If I seek, I will find. And if I knock, the doors will be opened up to me.  For I ask you, Mayor and City Council, to give me and my followers a safe place to dwell in your city. For we ask only out of need and not that of want. An abandoned apartment complex would be just fine for us to be free and live according to God's will, to be left alone and to be taxed.  no more of the burdens in which you place upon us. For if you wish to see us here no more, you will grant that in which I ask. For if you wish to deny my request, I will ask my Father to deny you in the days to come, and He will judge each and every one of you according to your works. Make no mistake, for I know whom I am, and I forgive you today, I pray.",Homelessness

I want to see a plan from our mayor as far as addressing, truly addressing the gun violence in this city. The mayor has held conferences, press conferences with his police chief. He has held some with the pastors. He has held some with Sarah Anthony, and we have yet to see a concrete plan  when it comes to gun violence in this city. Adam, I like you, I respect you, but this wasn't the only shooting in your ward that has happened this year. There's been many shootings. The first ward has had many shootings, the second ward, third ward, fourth ward, at large. The entire city has been dealing with gun violence in this city. And so, when are we truly gonna address the gun violence in this city? When are we gonna stop it? That's truly my question.  All right, let's put the political stunts to the side. Let's put the propaganda to the side and let's address the gun violence in the city because kids are dying. Kids are dying. And more kids are going to die. Tonight, somebody is going to get shot and killed. God forbid, but it's possible. Tomorrow, this weekend. And so we have a gun issue in the city. We don't have a business issue. That business did not pose a colossal danger to this community that gun violence does.  We've had, what was it, 517 gun range? 60 guns were stolen from that store. 60. I am sure many of those guns are in Lansing being used. I didn't hear any of our elected officials going to their elected officials and saying, hey, let's revoke their license. Many examples that I can cite and tell you guys, many stories.  But at the end of the day, I want to see plans. You guys are the elected officials. You guys like to flex your muscles here and there.

I'm a member of The Nation Outside, and their nationwide push that's entitled, The Rent Is Too Damn High. And I'm telling you right now that over 600 people showed up on the lawn, first day of the legislation session, that what we need is statewide rent control.  We heard a lot of horror stories. I'm sure anybody who's ever experienced house homelessness knows what it's like and how we're all at risk of it. Lansing Housing Commission, terrible conditions that are never remediated. They sold it to a for-profit company that said that they could guarantee that there'd be so many Section 8 houses. They can't guarantee that. They're not the ones who make the decision about who gets Section 8. And even when they do,  If somebody's got a two-month lease going, they can't show up tomorrow, which is what many Section 8 landlords want. And there's not nearly enough of them, so big problems. Another problem is municipal control, because some cities just don't care how many mega-landlords they get to gouge tenants and tell them, yeah, you can move in as soon as you give us a $600 two-month deposit.  than they do, and then they're told that the rent just went up $600. You know, that's not fair, right? So I learned today where Sarah Anthony and Kara Hope stand on this issue.  They're inclined to think that municipal control is great in the Democratic-controlled cities because they're liberal and they're going to vote for things that are good. And then there's the rest of the state. And I'm here to tell you, lots of people from all over the state came. They actually rented buses to come to that event on the lawn. And there's going to be another legislative day where we try to listen to the legislators and find out why they don't understand. We've got to get rid of municipal control, and we've got to give it statewide.  and the state will handle it in a much better way than what's happening now. So when it comes to the Lansing City Council, I hope y'all will go on record to be in favor of statewide rent control. And I'll be here to check on you.

I keep talking about the need to stress the fact that bicyclists have to obey the traffic laws as do vehicles when they're riding in the street. I was recently driving down Main Street at Normandy. There's a traffic light there. It's a bad intersection.  You will recall when somebody came down Normandy and ran right into the house across the street. There's a sign there that says, stop here for the traffic signal. Then there's another sign that says, accept bicycles. What the heck does that do? It certainly doesn't encourage the bicyclists to follow the traffic laws.",Governance and Civic Engagement

I've come over the last couple of months. The first time was in November to talk about the paving of Fairgrove as a special assessment.  And after that meeting and talking to Miss Donahue and also other neighbors that had come to the meeting and other just individuals in the neighborhood, I had expressed my opinion in the December meeting that, you know, paving the entire street was not what was best for the community.  My wife and I are not intending to cut down trees just to pave a road, but when we live on Forest Avenue at the corner of Forest and Fair Grove, we would like to have a street that's paved right there. Other individuals have said, why would we purchase a house on a dirt road? People will ask, why don't I drive a horse and buggy as well?  The only thing I would say is, you know, I also, you know, came to the commission with this as well because I had received a letter about a year and a half ago that during the road millage we would only pay 25% of what it would cost to have the road paved. And so it was in my best interest to say, why don't we, from an economic standpoint, you know, if we're going to have to pay for it, only pay a quarter rather than 100%. For the, what's on the agenda today, which is going to be item F,  That's going to be something that would be a half of a road from forest to the middle of Fair Grove and it would leave gravel road from the middle of Fair Grove all the way to Hawthorne Avenue. I think this is the best option for all of the neighbors that are there in my opinion. There are other neighbors that may think differently.  But it only assesses myself and the neighbor to the east who would like the road. And it does not assess any type of financial assessment to any of the neighbors outside of that as well.

I just wanted to say a few words. I do live at 2403 North Vermont. I have been a resident there for seven years. I have been a resident of Royal Oak for about 28, 29 years. I used to live downtown, used to live walking distance to town. And at a certain point, and I'll say age, I decided I wanted to move north of town to a quieter location.  I felt really fortunate to find a home that was on a large lot. It was actually a very unique home with the wide driveway, which is an easement. I have the Red Run golf course in the back.  It's really a beautiful spot and I cherish the peacefulness and the natural surroundings. So I have concerns. I always imagined that someone would probably buy the lot next door, there's a small brick home there, and probably build a new home and it would probably be a wonderful new home.  gentleman who did purchase is building beautiful new homes. So I have no issues with that at all, but I was very surprised that they might try to squeeze two new homes on this beautiful lot. It will take up really most of the green space. There's been a request and it was approved for a variance to have homes even closer together than should be allowed.  It's really going to be a shame for Vermont. I will be most affected by this. It will not be the home or the reason that I purchased this home with its beautiful surroundings.  I am not for having them take the driveway and part of the driveway and building a house on top of it. I will be driving right next to a new house in and out. I have a garage to the rear of my property. So it will be a regular thing for me to try to maneuver in and out of my garage.

Ms. Bollert is the owner and resident at 2403 North Vermont Avenue. On your consent agenda tonight, item G is a request to set a public hearing to vacate a public utility easement for a property located at 2321 North Vermont Avenue.  Ms. Bowler's property and the applicant's property are connected by a common drive. That common drive was created when the City of Royal Oak vacated a public road that was west of Parkdale in 1986. When the City of Royal Oak vacated that public road,  One half of that road became owned by Ms. Bollert or her predecessor in interest, and the other one half became owned by the applicant's predecessor in interest. At the time that the City of Royal Oak vacated that private drive, they reserved an easement for public utilities and also added some restrictive covenants attended there too, which basically said you can't build.  on the area that has an easement. The applicant is looking to divide his property into two parcels and build a new home on the parcel that's connected to the easement and he needs this commission to vacate that easement in order to build the second home.  Ms. Bowler, who hopefully can have three minutes too because I'm long-winded, is asking the City Commission to consider voting to remove that from the consent agenda for tonight or otherwise refraining from setting it for public hearing because even if this body were to determine that it was in the interest to, it was advisable to vacate that public utility easement,  It's Ms. Bowler's and my position that the applicant still wouldn't be able to build there because when the property was vacated, Ms. Bowler not only became a one-half owner of that property, but she also had an easement over all of that property. And even if that easement wasn't created by operation of law, and we obviously argued that it was, she would have a prescriptive easement, which is an easement that is  obtained by continuous use over a period of time in the state of Michigan, more than 15 years, which you tack predecessors and interest time doing it, and here that would be the case. So we think it's premature for this issue to be set for hearing. We're asking you to consider removing it from the consent agenda for that reason.

Item number four contained in the resolution of approval adopted at this council's May 23rd meeting stated that the petitioner shall make a good faith effort to meet with the group seeking to preserve the main art theater.  I present here a photo as evidence depicting the result of North Main's good faith effort. It's an empty space where the art theater once stood. Tonight, the petitioner is asking the city to let them out of their commitment to Leeds certification and to trust they'll make a good faith effort to achieve Leeds certification, which may or may not ever occur.  And then they ask the city to include in its agreement that there be no penalty resulting from their failure to meet the LEED certification. In a letter from Plunkett and Clooney, attorneys for the petitioner, it states, we would strongly encourage there be no penalty associated with the effort to acquire LEED certification should it fall short. Where does that leave the city?  In the Newman Consulting Group letter of January 22nd, it states, attached is the preliminary project checklist we made before the project had actually started. It shows what credits we think are possible before the actual design is done.  I could not find this checklist among the many documents presented by the petitioners. I believe that checklist would reveal how well the design itself reflects LEED certification values. And I suggest this might be an area where North Main could expedite the certification process by making design changes now that would earn them points.  Has North Main attempted to expedite the certification process? Have they submitted their plans for preliminary review by the Green Building Board? What steps have they taken to alleviate this great obstacle to the furtherance of this project other than asking the city to eliminate their public pledge for an environmentally conscientious building?  I humbly ask this council to uphold the resolution of approval adopted at the May 23rd meeting, and to help North Main in any way possible, other than modifying item five, to walk across this important threshold together with the city of Royal Oak into a more sustainable future.

RO_02_13_23,RO,"Royal Oak, MI",2023-02-13,2023-02-01,Training,Public Comment,Commenter,1306.0,1469.0,"Good evening, Mayor, Commissioners, Woody Gantina, 1422 Edgewood. I'm here to speak on item number eight as well. Frankly, I'm a little concerned that we have to be here, but I also understand it is a little bit of a complex issue. So for your debate and deliberations here tonight, to the best of your abilities, in your minds, if you might be best to decouple the issues of the temporary certificate of occupancy and the LEED certification.  I fully understand the developer's desire for a staged or expedited occupancy, as they put it in their proposal. This is very common for buildings of this type and not unique to this project, but this is a business decision by the applicant themselves, and they're putting themselves in this position, and it is not related to the LEED certification. If I understand the staff report correctly and Mr. Twain correctly, it would still need to satisfy all requirements to obtain a temporary certificate of occupancy if that was what they desired to do.  The LEED certification process, on the other hand, begins from day one of the project, typically during the design phase. So the notion in the information that was provided that the certification process does not begin until the building is complete is not accurate. The process is ongoing from the inception of the project through till the end. The certification itself certainly isn't complete until the building itself is done.  I think we all want the same thing here at the end of the day. A nice building on that site that's economically viable for the developer and is LEED certified. So I would like to suggest for your discussions later a few different things. Because I understand the complexity is around how this condition was written and tying the certificate of occupancy to the LEED certification and the complications that arise from that.  So potentially there's the ability to allow for a temporary certificate of occupancy, but the final certificate of occupancy being tied to the lead certification. It allows the developer time for their expedited occupancy, complete the building, but still holds them to the commitment of achieving certification.  In lieu of that, potentially having the developer post a significant bond to ensure that they will complete that certification, as walking away from a $1,500 registration fee is simply not enough of a disincentive for a developer to simply decide they don't want to do it at the end of the day. I believe that posting of a bond like this is very typical for private work that happens in the public right-of-way. I have examples of that myself.  Whatever your opinion may be, perhaps you tabled a decision tonight so that an amicable and fair solution for all sides can be achieved with more information being received on both sides. We passed the Sustainability and Climate Action Plan last year. Please don't back down from that. Achieving a LEED building and showing Royal Oak's commitment to sustainability, I think, is a great thing that we all want. So hopefully that helps you in your discussions this evening.

I have three brief things I want to package together. One is a thank you, another is a request, and the third is an announcement. Let's start with the thank you. In my preparation to come to the meeting tonight to speak on an agenda item, I called City Hall to see how do I navigate Romy.gov. I can't find the agendas.  And a young woman named Amy Brody, one of our municipal clerks, answered the phone. She was extremely helpful. Took my hand over the phone and led this senior citizen through Safari, how to find what I needed. So I want to give a shout out to Amy Brody. Number two is a request. At my last presence at a commission meeting, when something of importance came up for a vote,  You took a voice response and it was difficult for a very full audience to know who was voting what way.  I did write a letter to the commission following that and asked that, not for the consent agenda items, but for the ones with meat in them that come later on, that if you do a voice vote, that you also accompany it with the hands up so those of us in the audience are able to see who is voting what way. That's my request. The third is an announcement.  I am a 50-year resident of Royal Oak and a 50-year member of the First Congregational Church of Royal Oak, which was founded in 1842. Founders from our church are buried in our Royal Oak Cemetery. This year, we will be celebrating 181 years as a congregation of serving the greater Royal Oak community, and I'm very proud to be part of that.  Congregationalism is one of the mainline Protestant denominations. We choose and hire our own ministers. They are not sent down from above like many other denominations are. And this last Sunday, we voted to call Reverend Christopher Kurtz to be our 30th minister at the First Congregational Church of Royal Oak.  We have been in four different buildings in this city since the church began, was seated. And we're now at our fourth, and hopefully hold on to it, location. We're on the southwest corner of Crooks and Webster Roads. Our address is 1314 Northwood Boulevard, even though we're on an intersection of two major streets, and  Northwood Boulevard, our church on one end, whoops, and the shrine at the other end. So I want to tell you of that and invite you to come see who we are and what we do, 10.30 Sunday morning. Thank you.",Arts and Culture

Came here to speak about parking, but first of all, I'm a definite no on the marijuana at Arts Beats & Eats. It's a family affair. Let's keep it that way, guys. It's encouraging that the city manager will include the DDA working with the MPS to formulate recommendations by the second commission meeting in February to fix the system.  The DDA is the parking committee. Time is of the essence now that the MPS system has been expanded into the surface lots. And expanding the system into the surface lots voids any claim to eliminate the system due to non-performance. You attorneys ought to go back and get a...  Another shot at contract management. Anyway, my recommendations are accept the DDA recommendations. Have the DDA hire Rich and Associates to monitor the MPS data and report monthly the change in the number of violations due to exceeding the new 20-minute grace period.  Expand Rich & Associates MPS data monitoring to include the surface parking lots now that the MPS system has been expanded to include the surface lots. Place spots on TV and in print advising of the changes to the parking meter system that are being made to make it more user-friendly and reduce the number of citations. Provide signs on Washington and Main Streets  similar to those in the surface lots that advise with a 20-minute grace period and a local phone number to call for assistance. Add larger and more prominent stickers on the pay stations with the local phone number to call for assistance. I had to hunt for the police department number on the pay station to call. Anyway, reestablish the on-street parking ambassadors with  properly identified jackets so we know what they are. Now additional comments before I run out of time. It's hard to believe that an MPS parking system has only been operating for 13 months given the devastating effect that it has had on the downtown businesses. It was interesting to hear that a Richland Associates vice president could not figure out how to use the MPS pay system and left and still received a citation.  And Rich's confirmation that 77% exceeding the five-minute grace period will disenfranchise the patrons. Rich and Associates recommends on-street parking ambassadors and increasing the grace period. And I noted that the commission agrees that the number of citations is excessive, and the mayor agrees that they need to work on the system.  I will be interested to see what you do. Thank you.

You know, we started out with a modest bungalow and moved our way up as we could afford to. And we didn't expect anybody to change anything to suit our income. We worked to basically elevate ourselves into the neighborhood that we want to be in.  I attended one of the sessions on Saturday and the public comment was interesting. I didn't hear anyone who said that they wanted to get more multi-unit.  buildings in their neighborhood. They were looking to preserve the neighborhood, the Royal Oak, that they moved into, that we all moved into. You know, we don't come in wanting to change things. We move here. We chose the Royal Oak because this was a community we wanted to live in. And it's disturbing that there's  motion afoot to change that community. And one of the commenters earlier said, consider the source when you listen to people who come in on Saturday to attend a public hearing. And I find that really disturbing because  I don't think anyone there on Saturday was there because that's where they really wanted to be. It's because they felt they needed to be there to protect their neighborhoods. And so I would say that these people care, and these are precisely the type of people you should be listening to, are the ones who, for the residents, who come in and take their time to speak.  There was some discussion during the invocation about the influence of lobbyists. I'll just say that there are lobbyists and there are lobbyists. Some work to preserve constitutional rights, others are just motivated by greed to build and build.  You know, there's discussion tonight, too, about the parking plan downtown, and there's, you know, perhaps leeway to make some adjustments there. I mean, the poor women who spoke about their house with their big three-story unit going in behind them, you know, that's not going to change. They're stuck. You know, there's no going back and backtracking that. Once these neighborhoods are ruined, they're ruined, and that's just the way it is.

One of my concerns about the talk about the master plan is the elimination of the word preserve and this concept of redevelopment. In conversations with members of the city commission, we have heard, okay, well, we're going to wipe the slate clean, so to speak. That's disconcerting from the standpoint that we have many times.  We haven't implemented the existing, features of the existing master plan. So our concern here is that, okay, we're going to start all over and there are areas where we need to focus. Redevelopment is sort of a loaded word. I think a lot of us have expressed that concern tonight.  One of the things that attract us to Royal Oak is the large canopy of trees in the neighborhoods. And we've all seen on the streets with the big box homes going in, and this is not multifamily, but with the big box homes, those trees come down for the development and not much is planted in its place. So we're really, really concerned that that is going to irrevocably change the character  of their neighborhood. That's what the current master plan describes most, preserving. Now that doesn't mean that we can't enhance. Obviously we have to move forward and we have issues we need to address. But expending such a large amount of money to redo this master plan as opposed to focusing on certain areas I think is not wise. And I think we're moving much, much too fast on this.  We had our public hearings on Saturday and today we're here voting on whether to go forward with $450,000. That just seems way too fast. So thank you very much.",Urban Development

I live at 2724 Bembridge in the Woodward side subdivision. And like many other people who came up before me, I'm very concerned about the American Rescue Plan Act allocation.  I was born in Royal Oak in 1953. I lived here 13 years in the same neighborhood where I am basically. I purchased the home I'm in now in 1999. I'd like to also state that in 1988 I became a realtor and an associate broker in 2008. So I've been licensed for many, many years and I understand how markets work.  Like most of my neighbors and other residents here in this city and cities everywhere, one of the greatest things in the American dream is our ability to save our money, purchase a home, raise our families in the areas where we would like to or can afford to and particularly afford to.  Everybody has the opportunity to do it and they buy where they buy and raise their children where they raise them because they like the character of that area. I think it's really disconcerting to think that we could come in and make changes, dramatic changes such as those that were spoken about earlier and destroy in some regards what really mattered to a lot of us when we chose the neighborhoods we chose.  It has nothing to do with the affordability. It does have to do with the character of the buildings themselves and the parking and the density of the population, the change in that density. The last thing I'd like to say about that is that markets matter. There is supply and demand in real estate as well. I speak to people all the time, long before this subject even was brought in front of us.  and people that bought in the neighborhood that I live in and other neighborhoods that I've lived in bought in those neighborhoods because they wanted to live in single-family home neighborhoods and they'll move. If we have a lot of people who put their homes on the market at the same time, those seniors and people like myself, another senior who have been living in these homes for a long time and hope to  be able to stay there and afford it and maybe get a reverse mortgage or heaven knows what. We're going to see a depreciation in the values of our homes. We're not going to see appreciation. We're going to see them depreciate. It's a rule of real estate and it's a rule of the free markets.

Carrying on with the parking, Paul Brake's memo states that any of the proposed changes are predicated on the cooperation of MPS as we are obligated to follow the parking service agreement. This implies that MPS may not be obligated to follow the parking service agreement. MPS is not keeping their part of the agreement to provide a functional system. MPS agreed to include  an offsetting revenue stream that would result in a reduction of the number of tickets that are issued. We've got an engineering degree and an MBA and I can't figure out what that is. What does that mean and how does this eliminate the frustration of using the system? Note, MPS has no incentive to improve their meter systems since they share 50-50 in the fine revenue.  I suggest that the city escrow the MPS share of the fine revenue until they fix the system. That's what a renter would do to me if I didn't maintain the roof on the building. As far as information gathering, Paul Brake's memo states MPS was accommodating in providing basic information but reluctant to make changes to its system. What kind of cooperation is that?  Please have MPS provide an example city where the meters are working without problems and advise how the Royal Oak meter features differ from the working system. Perhaps we are asking for too many unique features.  As far as the conclusions and recommendations, the city recommends to keep reverse angle parking, 15 minute grease period, and a $50 fine for pull-in parking. The DDA recommends returning to pull-in parking, 20 minute grease period, and no fine for pull-in parking. The DDA is the parking committee. Why are their recommendations being ignored?  when they represent the downtown businesses and property owners. In conclusion, the problems with the MPS meter system have been unresolved for 14 months, which is far too long. Some business revenue is down 50% year over year, and others are leaving, as you've heard tonight. Time is of the essence. The system must be fixed or scaled down immediately.  And as I previously mentioned in public comment a couple weeks ago, the performance of the recently installed MPS surface parking meter system must be tracked to see if the problems have carried over to the surface slots.

I live at 1005 East 3rd Street. I'm about four blocks directly east of this building. Normally, I probably would have walked here this evening, but given the rain and the weather, I chose to drive. And I parked in the Farmer's Market parking lot. Honestly, I don't know if I'm going to get a ticket or not. I do consider myself pretty technologically savvy. I use the Century Mobile parking app with the concierge parking option.  And I can turn all the lights on in my house, on and off with my voice, using my phone, but I still can't figure out if I'm going to get a parking ticket or not. I have two engineering degrees, and I still can't figure out if I'm going to get a parking ticket or not using the app. I don't know where the ticket's going to go if I get a parking ticket. I drive a company vehicle. Is it going to go to my company? Are the fines going to get doubled? Is it going to come to me?  About 50% of the time, I park with the concierge feature. The app doesn't register my parking session, so I've begun recording all of my sessions myself, what time I enter the spot, the spot number, and what time I exit. This happened this past Saturday. I entered into the parking into my log. I was parked at space number 2312, just south of the mori. I entered the space about 11 a.m., exited about 1240. At the time, the app did not show it was an active parking session, so I recorded it.  I have to do this every time I park because I'm worried if I'm going to get a ticket or not. I went to have lunch with my friends and it was a topic of conversation that they brought up. They were visiting from Shelby Township, Bloomfield, Detroit, and they were saying what a pain it was that we were limited to two hours and couldn't enjoy a nice Saturday out for lunch and that we'd have to move our cars. Probably would have stayed around longer and frequented some more downtown businesses after lunch, but we cut it short.  There's no other community nearby that restricts visitors from parking nearby established or parking readily available. They suggested that next time we go to Birmingham and have brunch, this type of sentiment is damaging to our downtown businesses.  I ask that you make some significant common sense changes. Educate the community and potential visitors on the parking system, how to use it. The reverse angle parking on Washington, how to use it. Run some targeted ads on social media. Remove the two hour limit from street parking. Increase the five minute grace period. If you want to encourage people to move their vehicles or not park on the street for long periods of time, consider a graduated hourly fee schedule.  Paying more to park for longer periods achieves a similar effect of someone receiving a fine, but the psychological impact of their decision to return in the future is vastly different. Thank you.

Down the street from me, this was before the planning commission on January 10th, the property at 718 West 4th Street, they were going forward wanting conditional rezoning to be turned into multifamily with literally 12 variances to ordinances and current zoning. And obviously not in accordance with the current master plan. Essentially the building is a convalescent home.  And it could remain a convalescent home, and if it is not a convalescent home, it's supposed to be a single family.  At any rate, despite outpouring of disapproval by several of my neighbors, I believe 13 of us spoke, it was still approved by the planning commission. And obviously it now will come to you guys eventually for final approval. What's interesting is that during the planning commission meeting, many of the neighbors voiced concerns which actually aren't  letter of the law reasons why the zoning should not be changed for them, but were just indicative of bad neighbor behavior by the owner over the past 10 years that the owner owned the property. He basically allowed the building to fall into extreme disrepair on purpose, kind of creating the whole anything would be better support.  He also tried to sell the building for $1.9 million when he only paid $570,000 for it.  So what's interesting is that this person that owns the building is under extreme scrutiny now. We got the whole neighborhood all up in arms. It's gonna eventually come to the city commission for approval. You would think that they would actually try to do a little bit what they told the planning commission. They got up here and said, we were bad, we're good now. We won't not pull permits. We won't gut the building anymore without pulling permits. That was all in the past. We're good now, we're good now.  Well, guess what? It's unsecured. There's broken windows on the main floor. You think they could at least get their shit together while they're under scrutiny. So I thought you should know.",Housing

I just moved in recently and got a giant bill for a pavement project. Buying the home, I didn't know this was a thing in Royal Oak. Additionally with that, even if I did know, it still would be a little bit upsetting. I pay my taxes, I pay to come park down here.  It seems like it would have made more sense if we increased taxes for $5 to $10 for everyone. So the price is just spread out between every person. We all use the sidewalks. It's not one person's. So that's kind of perplexing to me why that's not what we chose to do. Other than that, it seems like it's a bit of a conflict of interest that the city got to choose one entity to do everyone's sidewalk.  As a consumer, I love to shop around. I would like to be entitled to the opportunity to see, can I get a better deal? Maybe I also wanted to do my driveway. Two in one, get a good price. So those were my concerns. I don't know if there's anything we can do at this point because it seems pretty far down the road. But I can't imagine if I was a single mother, even a single father, getting a thousand dollar, a couple thousand dollar bill is really a true impact.  I would love if you respond.",Housing

I attended a master plan meeting and roundtable. My group had concerns from safety at night downtown to keeping our neighborhoods from being swallowed up by high rises and overdevelopment that would and have already taken away some of the character, beauty, privacy, green space,  lower traffic volume, and the community aspect of single-dwelling residential housing. Our leaders seemed to listen and encouraged us to give suggestions, praising us for creativity and thoughtfulness about keeping our neighborhoods intact, and that he understood that sometimes less is more. We all had a chance to voice our opinions  and then we proceeded to the summary presentation. To my disappointment and some others, during his post-it note summary, he was vague, left out or misrepresented some of our main points that he had praised us on. Perhaps for a truer explanation of what people believe, the people in each group can write their own brief post-it notes  This way the real message is presented to the entire audience. Some concerns our leader minimized or left out were work on infrastructure and getting things straight with existing problems in the city before taking and rushing through too many projects big or small. This includes trying to fill vacant buildings or housing throughout the city and on Woodward. Safety downtown.  Number three, consider the people in the single dwelling residential neighborhoods. Would anyone here that enjoys an unblocked view in their yard like a three to four story Bigfoot building right up to their property? My poor neighbor on Batavia. Please give me a show of hands if you would like a three to four story building right behind your house. I know you're not going to do it, but it's really hard for her and I feel very badly.  Please stop destroying existing mature trees. This would help believe the Arbor Day proclamation. We should always be planting new trees, which we are, but most take 20 years to mature. The city supports a climate action plan. Overdeveloping with too much cement and buildings filling every last green space adds to climate issues. I'm looking forward to another workshop and thank you for giving me the opportunity. Thank you.  Right here.",Urban Development

So my name is Trish Oliver. I live at 722 Southwest Street and I've been in Royal Oaks since 1986. So first of all my compliments to my fellow Royal Oakers for their public engagement and being here tonight. This is what will make our representative government effective and I so appreciate their presence.  We personally have been out of power the last five days from the ice storm, so we are doing our best under difficult circumstances, enjoying our sleeping bags and our candlelight ambience throughout the house. I am here tonight to speak about number 11, approval of American Rescue Plan  Act allocation, ARPA. I am concerned about the insertion of multi-family housing into our single-family neighborhoods. I would like to understand why we are spending $300,000 on consultants to rewrite the master plan when we have a good existing one for which elements have not been implemented. I think here in Royal Oak we're not particularly fancy people. I think we have good common sense and we like to be  thrifty and fiscally responsible. So I think we would like to implement elements of the existing master plan before we move to one where the emphasis shifts from protect our single family neighborhoods to redevelop. I would propose that any decision makers who could benefit from political contributions from developers or any other person involved in the process  Write an ordinance to refrain or voluntarily refrain from taking any political contributions.  I noticed at the master plan meetings this past Saturday that many residents were deeply discouraged because they felt that the meetings with the consultants were a dog and pony show that were guiding us towards a preordained outcome and that the buzzwords such as affordable or attainable housing and the narrowing of Woodward or 11 Mile were inserted into the discussions as well as other buzzwords by the consultants. I feel very sorry for my fellow residents who feel very disenfranchised and ignored  and also are very worried, like myself, about the negative impact of the insertion of multi-family homes into single-family neighborhoods. The commissioners who run for re-election this November should disclose all the political contributions that they've received from developers in the past. And in closing, I would like to say, if we gathered on Saturday to brainstorm the master plan,  which unofficially includes the city inserting multiple family zoning into our single family neighborhoods. Why is the commission moving forward tonight to discuss spending $450,000 of ARPA money towards multiple family housing? Thank you for your attention and your consideration of my comments. Thank you, Ms. Oliver.",Housing

Regarding the parking, frankly, I was stunned by some of the city manager's recommendations and I'm sure the members of the DDA were too. The city manager should finalize negotiations with these changes and bring it back to you for final approval. The reverse angle parking from every metric you can think of except tickets is an absolute failure.  You were told by the police chief in July 2021 meeting that it could be changed back, not changed to parallel. I urge you to reject the city manager's recommendation and vote to change it back to regular angle parking. Two, handicap parking. Direct the city manager to establish, not explore additional on-street accessible parking. Three, increase the time limit to three hours  without allowing rate increases for the third hour. That would be so confusing. Regarding ARPA, although I agree with many of the items, I disagree with some and the basis for some of the decisions. Estimates should have been included prior to the residents and you expressing where you wanted the funds distributed.  For instance, the $1.5 million cost for a sign. I wonder if even 6% of the public would have voted for this had they known the cost. I urge you to eliminate this from consideration. YMCA, $1.5 million. Although the residents and the city commission both put a community center high on their bucket list, the estimated $30 million is huge.  Knowing they have had financial problems, I hope they are able to raise enough grants and outside investors because Royal Oak cannot afford it. Until we know the answer to that, I would be hesitant to include it. Library solar roof and broadband programs for $402,000. We just passed a 10-year library millage that includes a headly override that will generate more than $3.8 million extra tax revenue, more than enough to pay for these  and leave almost $3.4 million extra headly dollars in their budget. I suggest that it does not come out of ARPA funds. Based on the estimate for putting two small bathrooms in the park, the proposed bathroom in the ARPA list, which is 10 times larger, should be over $3 million, not $750,000. Another no until we know exactly how much this will cost.  Item 13, on tonight's agenda item 6P, the engineering department sought a bid for $82,000 in engineering survey projects, yet you are being asked to approve a contract with Krieger Klatt for over $200,000 without doing the same. Pre-awarding a contract for the animal shelter before we have even secured the building and funds is risky. Further, the ARPA funds for the farmer's market bathroom have not been solidified. This is putting the proverbial cart before the horse.  And the last item, Rules of Procedure, it includes staff reports greater than two pages should be provided to the public no later than 4.30 on Tuesday prior to the meeting. But you don't have to post the agenda until Friday. So how would the people know to ask for it? Thank you.",Governance and Civic Engagement

I just want to talk about what the construction has been like since it began. First of all, this multi-unit condo complex has been recently constructed or started construction  It's 25 feet away from our fence line, which when you see it, it's pretty intimidating. It's actually alarming to see how close it is to our property. We believe this is going to immensely impact our afternoon sunlight, privacy, and quality of life. There is some sunlight coming from the open areas of the building as nothing is really closed off yet. Ashley and I have become avid gardeners since occupying the home eight years ago. The afternoon sun is going to be greatly impacted by the height of this building.  We learned in addition the balconies are going to be facing our backyard. With a distance of 25 feet from our fence line, the fence Mr. Wolfson had constructed will provide no privacy when residents are on their balconies. We're hoping the plan remains to have trees planted. But to have multiple people in multiple units looking down on our property seems quite invasive and something a normal height privacy fence won't solve.  I highly doubt any resident would enjoy having a LARC development this close to their property line, and furthermore, not feeling as comfortable to go outside and enjoy a warm summer evening, feeling like people were watching them. This was not a concern with the previously located single-family homes. We know that more issues are going to arise once these units are occupied, but at this point what's been discussed  as what we know for certain based on the proximity alone of the property to our house and knowing the path of the sun as it passes over our home. I invite any of you, anyone here, to take a walk down Batavia Avenue. We have a big dumpster in our driveway. You can see how close this is. You don't even have to go into the backyard, but if you want to, you're welcome to step foot in it and take a look and see just what it looks like. It's interesting.  The fence line, I think, might be six feet tall, but the way it looks, I probably shouldn't leave the podium. I just want to show you guys, this is what Wilson constructed, and this is the second floor where I believe the balconies are going to be. This is from looking up my backyard, just looking at the deck. You guys want to stop by, you're welcome to.  We weren't aware when we agreed, well, when the variances were done, we weren't aware how it was gonna look, but 25 feet is very intimidating. So thank you for your time.",Housing

The last two speakers were part of our association. We're in the South End. We started, registered 1996. Tremendous amount of urban renewal, great success, great working with the commission, with the mayor, with the city manager, with the recreation department, planning department. So it's been a good partnership.  Right now with the master plan, we see preservation meeting innovation. So it reminds me of don't throw the baby out with the bathwater. So preservation is preserving and enhancing what we have that works, the great success of this city. This city is envied by other cities across the state.  Innovation is to embrace and utilize technology, adopt sustainable principles, and promote diversity, inclusion, and variety of housing. So we've got a delicate balance with both. So that's the fun of this new master plan. The original and the current master plan reads  Preserve, maintain and enhance the character of existing neighborhoods. 2012, goal number one. So this objective and goal is why we have such amazing neighborhoods and the buildup and the land values, the solid tax base and people that love to live here. It's the lots, plus the diversity of the other great things we have in this town. What's alarming  is that the new master plan information and website and information.  is saying that it's preservation and redevelopment in established neighborhoods. So where did this come from? Why did this change? Are we a sprawling suburb that has been wasteful? Is there a failure with the previous planning and goals? It's just when we see a new word and a change like this, it almost sounds like a pre-conclusion that city leadership has predetermined  the master plan study and direction to consulting planners. And my neighbors feel, when I talk to them, they almost feel like this is in motion. They say, Mike, you can't do anything. They've already said what the study's gonna lead to and what the end result will be. So I don't believe that. I believe it's input, it's working with you, and it's working together, and we're gonna continue to be a great city.  We're most concerned with the land use plan that comes out of this study.  So this is what protects the homeowners in certain zones. I'm running out of time here, but there's great lessons learned from our south end. The rub is put in big buildings next to little buildings. It's physical, it's size, solar exposure, privacy. I have a case study. My neighbor, Rachel, could she speak right after me? Sure, I can call her. So this is about the physical  effects of putting a big multi-family housing next to existing neighborhood houses.",Housing

Now that we're addressing the new master plan, I think it's important that we don't forget the evolution over the last 25 years. The berms in the south end are not obsolete now that Franklin Elementary is no longer there.  With all the money that's been spent and all the improvements to the berms and the barriers in the south end, why would we spend more money to pull them out? I mean no disrespect, but I don't feel that it's a good plan.  I practice what I preach. I don't take Alexander to cut through to 11 Mile. I don't take Kaiser to cut through to CVS on 4th Street. I purposely ignore my GPS when it recommends that I drive through my own neighborhood or any residential neighborhood, whether it be for business or for personal use. Why would anybody think that it's inappropriate to buffer non-residential traffic from a highway off-ramp into a residential neighborhood?  With all of the improvements that we've made in the neighborhood to Lawson Park and to Franklin Park, I don't think anybody here would want their children or their grandchildren playing in that park with unrestricted parking, unrestricted parking, sorry, unrestricted traffic barreling through.  We're working hard to maintain the sanctity of our neighborhood and make sure that we maintain those solid borders to discourage non-residential traffic. If we break that open, that non-residential traffic will filter through into the neighborhoods north of Lincoln. We have more stressors than just 696 and the service drive. We have the DTE substation and the train tracks.  And let's not forget what just happened in East Palestine, Ohio. We need to be very aware of this and, if anything, make our neighborhoods safer.",Transportation and Mobility

I too was at one of the workshops on Saturday and I think they're a great opportunity to give input there and I was very happy to do so. One of my thoughts that I had that I'd just like to reiterate here this evening  is that my wife and I have lived in Royal Oak since 1981 in the same house there. Raised five children. We're right close to Lawson Park and the development of that is great. My grandkids really like it when they come over. So we really enjoy a lot of the improvements that we've seen in the city and I compliment the commission on those changes that we've made here in the city.  But as we walk around the neighborhood and we see a lot of the changes that are going on, and especially one of the things that we've noted is as we walk along the old Irving truck route, which was previously in the one area there was light industry around the recycling center and the junkyard and other businesses, which there's only a few still left there.  And I've noticed that the development around that whole area has been residential with condos, lofts, townhouses.  It's all residential in there that's being developed with the exception of the marijuana dispensary that was just approved recently. So my thought here is we'd like to protect that area. Now whether that's grandfathering the existing businesses there so that they can continue, but once they, if when they leave, that that property be zoned residential.  Because that's the whole area around it is residential. And with other business, with this latest business that's gone in there, the increased traffic, which literally would be driving through all the neighborhoods right there, isn't what the city of Royal Oak stands for. So I'd just like to make that statement and hope that that's a consideration going forward with the master plan.  Thank you.",Urban Development

I have a couple of things to address. One, I'm not 100% I'm not totally caught up on what the specific proposal is from the Downtown Development Association with respect to parking. I will say that I as a resident would prefer that we don't completely remove parking meters  without a plan to reinstall some sort of new parking meter system in the near future. I'm sort of ideologically opposed to free parking in important downtown areas. It's like really valuable public space.  Secondly, with respect to the master plan process, I was at one of the master plan meetings and I will agree that most of the people who were there seemed to be opposed to the addition of missing middle zoning throughout the city, as well as a lot of other plans that have been considered. I was one of the few people there who is very supportive of those sorts of changes and allowing more affordable housing  more market rate housing, denser housing, and I will just mention that the demographics of people who attend meetings in the afternoon on a Friday or  in the afternoon on a Saturday to discuss local public matters is heavily skewed compared to the rest of the entire population of the city and that the city commission should take that into consideration when considering the input from such meetings.

I work for Michigan State College of Human Medicine in support of its medical student programs.  I appreciate in the invocation the reference to the tragedy that occurred at our campus and I indeed felt some of that as I spent much of the following day contacting several of our medical students to check on their health and well-being and having a lot of difficult conversations.

But in preparing to come this evening to address you regarding my grave concerns related to the recent power outage, one of a series of power outages that we have all, many of us, faced, your mission refers to the safety and well-being of citizens.  Well, certainly, we pray for the safety and well-being of all of us from gun violence. And there are, and perhaps, different ways that can be addressed, some of which, Mayor Fornia, you referred to. But I would say the pathway to solving the endemic and persistent problems in this state, in this city, in this region of Southeast Michigan, with respect to our decaying power plant, are not as elusive and evasive as the solutions to societal gun violence.  Indeed there are practical solutions and I beg this city commission to take direct responsibility upon yourselves to routinely return to this important topic including it on agendas  I was rather disappointed to not see this item on this agenda. Whereas I see other items dated to the 23rd, 24th, I see nothing regarding this. Something that made national news that was covered in a Time News article on the 24th. I was further disturbed in reviewing the current strategic plan through 2025 to see only one reference.  At the very end, in the last item on strategic plan, the only action item that I can see this commission is committed to with respect to DTE is to form relationships. To begin forming relationships. My goodness.  Relationships should have been formed in the wake of 2017's record power outage or in the wake of 2021's record power outage.

I grew up by Stevenson and 11 Mile Road over there. I went to all the schools here. Now, we have the most wonderful people here, like I said.  that are so talented. You don't pull the resources from the citizens, you hire consultants and we pay for that. And I also know that a previous mayor is involved in the convalescent home deal, an attorney for that.  that they want to put 21 places in there and don't tell me that you are in favor of infrastructure when you can have that used as a convalescent home or maybe six or seven apartments or condos or eight.  When you have 25 bathrooms, 25 stoves, 25 refrigerators, no, that's not the way it works. That's not common sense. The people that spoke on the 27th, remarkable people. We had a realtor that knows all about real estate. We had people come up about the parking, which is ridiculous. How much money have we spent on the parking?  John came up and he asked you a question. He said, who approved the development for affordable housing? And he didn't get an answer. I have a feeling, and I'm not saying I'm accusing anybody, and I have no prejudices or anything like that. But I came up here, when I heard that woman speak, we're gonna make Royal Oak the example for the whole United States of America.  I would love a documentary on our country someday, I mean on this city one day, showing that we lost our city and how we brought it back to the all-American city. We have people in this city, we are not prejudiced. You can take it, there's always going to be prejudices. But you know what? We are not that kind of city. I grew up here, we didn't have riots in the streets. We didn't have troubles in our schools. People are starting trouble amongst these children. And here's another thing.  Adults can do what they want, and you know what I'm talking about. They can do whatever they want. I am not prejudiced. I respect anybody, who they are, what they do.

I'm here to address the new parking or pay station kiosks. I've been a resident in Royal Oak since 1974 and it started out as a friendly small town but it was a big city. A big city with a small town field.  These parking kiosks and the whole system throughout Royal Oak is unfriendly. It's really unfriendly to many people.  The parking isn't smart and easy. It's not easy at all. The pamphlet with instructions is four pages long and doesn't answer all the questions we have. Like this lens here in the middle that faces the side I pay on, is that taking my picture? It looks like a camera lens. What are the two circles of perforations that look like speakers on each side of that lens? Are they listening to me? Can they speak to me?  That's not on the pamphlet. Coin meters didn't need a pamphlet at all. It just said insert coins. That was it. And it's obvious which meter was intended for your car. The new screens are difficult to see when the sun glares on them, much like your smartphone, you know, when you have to go to the shadows to see them. Smartphones,  have to go to the shadows to see them. Okay, sorry. Not the coin meters though. They have clear glass. Their print is black on white and it's easy to see. Unfriendly to seniors is what it is. Also to physically or mentally handicapped or challenged. Those for whom English is a second language would also have a difficult time.  It also appears that we're trying to phase out cash that will take away our freedom to choose how we want to pay. And I think that's an alarm that really needs to be sounded. Because if we go to a cashless society without currency and without coin, we're giving our power over to someone else. We all know about how some credit cards have been hacked  You use apps, either credit card or apps for this parking and you don't have a choice for coin. I'd like to see Royal Oak make a law that says they will always use cash and use coins and currency so we have the freedom to choose. Using a credit card or apps makes everyone at risk for being hacked.  and are sensitive information being stolen. And I'm talking about how if we're phasing out coins, which it looks like the plan is because those machines that take coins also take credit cards and apps.

I've been a Lyft driver for 7.3 years. I've lived here for over five. And my biggest problem is trying to pick up passengers. There's no area I can stop and safely pick up people. Like there's areas that are busy like on Main Street where they could easily bag off the parking meters and then we could pick up people.  Instead, I got a ticket on Main Street because there was nowhere for me to park. I mean, it was like an impeding ticket. It was $160. So I live at 800 East Lincoln and I end up going to Ferndale in Detroit to drive people because it's easier to pick up than it is here when I literally live three blocks away.  It's just frustrating and it costs more money for passengers because other drivers don't want to come here as well and pick up because where are you going to pick people up? And then people order when they're at a venue. For example, if you're at 526 Main Street, they're going to order a ride and they're going to expect me to stop on Main Street to pick somebody up and I can't.

I'd like to talk about the parking as well. I think the main thing we need to consider here is who's the parking supposed to serve and when is it supposed to serve them. I think the on street parking should mainly serve residents and the businesses as far as commerce goes at night, by all means.  We don't need any street parking. Those people should all be encouraged to go into the garage. As far as Fifth Street goes, between Fifth Avenue and the new place, let's just get rid of Fifth Avenue between there. We should just do it. It's been like that for a long time. If we got rid of it, we could plan around things. We could have electrical hookups for when we have events like Arts Beats and Neats, so on and so forth. And also, I would love to see if we could have some sort of way to have a walkway that goes up  and over as well as an elevator that goes up and over the train crossing there for accessibility and safety reasons. Also, I know you're talking about EV recommendations later tonight. As far as that goes, I think the low-hanging fruit here is an ordinance that says any new parking facility built in the downtown district must have a meter at each spot. Whether it be a residential building, whether it be commercial building,  Mandatory because let's just be forward thinking because eventually that's going to be what's needed. And the garage where I park, which is a city garage that I pay monthly for. There are 2 EV stations. I don't always get to use them. And also they're not handicaps parking spots either, which means they're not handicap accessible. So those are important things.  great stuff about the Lyft driver. I've driven 15,000 miles in the last three months. I do Uber. Great points, salient points here. But yeah, please take all that into consideration.",Transportation and Mobility

A couple of things that I noticed were not on there. First off, there's a lot of people that I've talked to who are very upset when a guy pulls out of his parking spot, the little icon is still green, he pulls in and gets a ticket.  If you're going to have it where the new guy pulling in automatically gets rolled over, which is a current policy, there should be a software change where that light changes when that guy leaves. There's more than, like I say, more than one person's gotten very PO'd that they pull into what they thought was a green spot with time left on it and then gets a parking ticket. Doesn't feel good. Secondly, with regards to the parking structure,  We have a 60% usage rate. I don't see anything in your recommendations to try and figure out why people don't use the parking structure.  I hear a lot of, they're just gonna have to get used to using it. We're gonna take away all the surface parking and force them to use it. I got news for you folks, they don't have to use it. They can go somewhere else. So unless we find out why they're not using it and fix that, all you're going to do is PO more people and infect your downtown.  Okay, you've got 60% now, people are not using the structures, either they don't feel safe in them, either they're too high, there's not an attendant, I don't know, but we've got to find out why they're not there and not just demand people use them. Because they ain't using them and you can't force them to use them, they'll just go somewhere else.  Finally, on the parking contract itself, I read the whole thing. I am frankly dismayed that we have three lawyers on the staff plus a city attorney will let a contract like that go through. I don't know how you cancel it. There's no performance requirements anywhere for that vendor to actually have to fix his system. I mean, there's an option for him to take another five years, how much revenue he's gonna have, there's a lot of stuff in there for them.  There's nothing in there for us. Now I've had 30 years, I'd like people to say how many 30 years, 40 years in private industry sourcing parts. Trust me, there's no way in hell a contract like that would ever let out with no performance requirements at all. So I don't know what you have to fix with your contract end of this stuff, but that one, I don't know how you're going to get out of it, quite honestly. Thank you.",Transportation and Mobility

The problem with parking around Royal Oak, we have limited parking around our place. We have a new building going up, which means even less.

Now, five minutes  They can't even make it in the door and up to the floor in the elevators in five minutes and they get a ticket. It's got to be 20.

I've wrote complicated programs. I even wrote screens. They can be reprogrammed. Either MSP doesn't have the talent to change those programs or not the will to change them because they want everybody to back in. I have seen people parking that can't even park straight heading in. How are you going to get them to park back in straight? Now come on.  Washington and Center Street are gonna die. And it will be on your heads when they die if you don't change it to head in parking. It's a simple task. You have kiosks in P8.  All they do is come up, put their license plate number, boom, boom, they're gone. You can do the same thing with those parking meters on Washington and Center. Matter of fact, you can do them all. All you have to do is change the program.

And I thought I was going to be the only one speaking about the parking meter problem. There is nothing new in the City Manager's update. His recommendations have not changed and they ignore the DDA's recommendations. And the DDA is the Parking Committee.  Flint has had problems with the MPS meter system since day one. New Jersey, the first MPS installation, did not extend the contract after the initial five years. Flint is four years into a five-year contract and will not renew. Flint has not had much cooperation from the MPS on any of the large issues.  MPS will not take responsibility for a problem unless you can prove that there was an issue. Flint also has coin and credit card issues like Royal Oak where the credit card gets stuck in there and you can't get it out or it won't take quarters.  The MPS system does not reduce the number of people required to manage the system, as we know here. The business owners are burdened with assisting people and using the meters, the same as in Royal Oak. Flint did not expand the MPS system to include surface lots. MPS wanted a separate contract for the surface lots that would have given them a full five years  Is this the same in Royal Oak? I used to tell my clients that I spend their money like I spend my own. If you bought a washing machine that was nothing but trouble and the manufacturer would not fix it, would you buy a dryer from the same manufacturer? Why then would you expand the MPS system to the surface lots when the on-street system is not working?  and the MPS will not fix it. It doesn't make any sense. Your handling of the parking meter system is irresponsible and is negatively affecting downtown businesses, business owners' livelihood. A longtime restaurant and entertainment business has just posted a sign in their window advising that dining  the dining area is temporarily closed. They are down 40% in year-over-year revenue. And speaking of irresponsible, you paid to have the preparation in the park for a lavatory and now you're abandoning that and you're putting an even larger lavatory or comfort station in the corner of the  the parking lot at Farmer's Market. Again, this is just your responsibility. That's money down the drain. And the only reason I can think of is that you're putting a larger facility in is to accommodate John Witts and his activities in the park. Thank you.

I actually wasn't going to speak, but hearing so many people speak sort of inspired me. My name is James. I'd rather not give my address due to my inability to stop fighting with people on Facebook, so I don't want them to have my address.  You know, I moved to Michigan three years ago and immediately fell in love with Royal Oak. I mean, it's impossible to have a bad meal in the city. People are very friendly, great place to take the family walking. And we hang out over here all the time. I have a little bit of a different aspect from everyone else. I've actually been in parking management for 10 years, especially in the city of San Diego, a city of almost 2 million people.  And I really give kudos to the commission it seems like you guys have been extremely responsive and very eager to sort of settle the issues that's going on with the parking. However, I hate to say it's in vain. Technology wise, it is nearly impossible to run a vision system.  on street parking. It's really only designed for one way in, one way out. So stadiums, garages, stuff like that. And Municipal Parking Services, who does a great job of sounding like an official government entity, but they're a private company, they do a really good job of selling it to you and selling it to everyone and letting them know, hey, we can do this. It's gonna eliminate your labor costs and it's not gonna cost you a thing. We're gonna come set it up and all we want is half the ticket revenue.  But unfortunately, metered cameras are only about 50% accurate. The reason why is because if someone's trying to pull into another stall and they hit the vision of the camera, it triggers the camera. The camera is not continuously running. So since it's not continuously running, that person is going to get triggered for a ticket regardless if they paid or not.  That's how NPS is designed. The reason why they want 50% of the revenue is because they want to take it as much as they can. It's a wildly inaccurate system. I certainly would never, ever, ever encourage anyone to ever put some sort of operation like that on the street until the technology's there, which we're like maybe four or five years out. I think a much better process would, I mean, I'm a labor guy. I'm from a union family.  I'm a bigger believer of having jobs and having people monitor and actually go out and ticket and have a scanning vehicle and everything like that. But really, all that's gonna happen is, I'd hate to see the council dwell and spend as much time as they can on it. Whatever changes is gonna be made, it's still not gonna increase the amount of tickets that are going out. It's still not gonna increase the efficiency of the system. And it certainly isn't gonna be fair to the residents.  I would strongly encourage, and if anybody else is having any issues, I'm more than happy to talk to anyone. I'd strongly encourage trying to move away from that type of system. And there are plenty of ways to move away from it. But this isn't the first time that the companies like duped cities like this before. They have a long track record of doing this. So thanks so much for the time.

My wife Katie is sitting in the back row with me. I live at 724 Knoll Street. I've only been here two years as a resident.  But about 10 months now as a business owner. And I thought maybe it would be useful to you to hear a business owner's voice. We are on Main Street with Gift Thanks Bakery. And I can actually attest to the fact that Uber Eats drivers don't stop. They really would rather not come to Royal Oak. Only in desperation do they pick up the ride. And I think we heard that from a couple of drivers before.  I also have at least, I mean I can't actually prove it, but I can tell you that we have a store in Rochester, which is sort of our benchmark. When we opened the store in Royal Oak, we thought that by now we would be at about 80% of revenue. We cannot seem to jump over the 50% hurdle.  And just from the testimonials that we're getting from our customers and from on social media, et cetera, I really can, I can come to no other conclusion than it has to do with parking. And I just think you should just hear that from a business owner's perspective. I'm not qualified to comment on the technology. I would imagine that asking you to dismantle the system is quite unrealistic.  So that's really not what this is about, but I think if we can just figure out a way to use the technology, to program it in a way that makes it a bit more friendly to use, and maybe most importantly, be very generous with your grace periods. The city will not go bankrupt over five minutes, up or down. But if you give the businesses a 30-minute grace period, we may have a fighting chance of explaining to people that they can come in,  wait in line, get their stuff, wait for their coffee, maybe even sit down for a quick five-minute chat and go out and not have to be faced with a $20 ticket. So, we would just like for you to know that from a business owner's perspective and would encourage you and hope that you will be generous when you decide on these grace periods that are apparently on the table.

I've been living here just over 20 years. We've had some wild storms in the last several days. I've never imagined so many so close together. I feel 50-50 on how the city has handled the tree issue with the branches that have come down. I feel 50-50 on that.  I feel 50-50 because I did a lot of Facebook reading and on what, you know, Bloomfield Hills was doing, Birmingham was doing, that they were making special arrangements to come pick up the branches in Royal Oak. You know, when you call, there was like no plan in place. There was no exception that was going on or anything that I guess you could say that was pre-planned in case something like this happened.  I'm glad to hear that they came by and picked up my branches. Excuse me, I'm glad to hear they did that, but my first response when I called the city is, it's my fault if I don't have a tree on the, between the sidewalk and the street, it's my responsibility, like it should be, but exceptions for what's happened. I just, um...  I guess I would hope that there's a better plan in place because climate change is changing and I would like to see more of that happening. I don't have $55 now to call somebody to come and do that special pickup and special, you know, the guy, the special contractor guy to come.  I guess I would just like to see a change. I would like to see a plan in place for future storms. We had an amazing amount of trees that came down.

Regarding agenda item number 10 parking I've heard all over the news that supposedly there's supposed to be some big announcement tonight but when I'm looking at the document that was attached to the agenda there's nothing new there that I can see so I can only comment on what is in there. If there was something new it should have been included in the agenda so for the public and for you to read ahead of time.  I agree with extending the five-minute grace period to 15, extending the two-hour parking limit, and adding on-street handicap parking, which I've been requesting repeatedly for about four years now. This afternoon, I was listening to WJJR, and during a long discussion on how bad the parking is in Royal Oak, Chuck Gaidica and Chris Renwick cited their dislike for the reverse angle parking, and I agree.  But going to parallel will decrease parking by 30 spaces and negatively impact both businesses and customers.  and that's the only other alternative I see on the proposal. Reverse angle was only supposed to be a test, if you go back and watch the meeting. As Mayor Fournier stated when it was proposed, we have the ability to reverse course, this is a quote, if it turns out to be a dismal failure, and that was based on the former police chief's documents. I think we can all agree that that is exactly what it is, a dismal failure.  and therefore changing back to regular angle parking should be included in the contract negotiations with MPS. Secondly, tonight you are being asked to rubber stamp another contract in agenda item number 9, the siren proposal for $150,000.  The document says the $150,000 does not include news releases, videos, letters, marketing materials, website content, flyers, FAQs, talking points, and social media content as part of the campaigns. Given our last contract with Siren exceeded the contract amount by 67%, I can only wonder how much more this $150,000 contract will be.  Further, what did the other three bidders propose? And what did their bids include? You've only got one presented to you here tonight. Why weren't there proposals attached for review? And without that information, I urge you to vote no on this contract until you can review the other bids.  Maybe, if you had been given other choices to review instead of accepting staff's loan recommendation for the MPS downtown parking meters, you could have made a better informed decision.

For about 28 years, I've been a homeowner in Royal Oak, sometimes referred to as the City of Trees in Tree City, USA. I'm here tonight to give city officials some feedback on the post ice and snowstorm activities from a long time.  homeowners perspective. First I'd like to applaud city management for recently committing resources to clean up storm damage throughout the neighborhoods. So I walk my dog around I see a significant amount of tree damage and debris left at the curbs. It's gratifying that the city decided to make a dedicated effort to clean up the storm debris. So thank you. Second though I have concerns  and some constructive criticism related to city actions and communications in the immediate days following the storm. I detailed my concerns in a letter sent last week to the city manager and the department heads of community development, which includes the building and code enforcement areas and the Department of Public Services. In summary, the ice storm happened on Wednesday and Thursday, Feb. 22-23.  I worked hard to clean up extensive damage of downed branches and limbs that fell both at my house and two of my neighbors. I put the branches in roughly three foot, 50 foot long piles along the curbs of my and my neighbor's homes. As I finished cleanup the next day, February 24th, I called the city, determined if the city would be sending a shredder through the neighborhoods and was told no, it was the homeowner's responsibility. And I was also told that I could contract  or contact the city contractor J.H. Hart for assistance at a small fee. By the way which is $55 for each 15 minutes. On Monday the 27th I called J.H. Hart. The contractor was told they received a high volume of calls and tentatively scheduled me for cleanup Wednesday March 1st. In the meantime I was shocked to receive a city violation notice dated Tuesday February 28th for having branches and limbs at the curb.  was given seven days to correct this violation. Couldn't believe the city code enforcement officer was driving around writing violations after this bad ice storm, especially while the city, including my neighborhood, had widespread power outages. From my perspective, I did the best to promptly clean things up. I felt I took prompt, responsible, appropriate action. After reading the code violation, I felt  A total lack of compassion, common sense, and decency for taxpaying residents during a very challenging time. I've since talked with the code enforcement officer and Jason Craig, the city building official. They each indicated during the early days of the storm, DPS stated it was a homeowner's responsibility to do so, clean it up.  And they just were out to enforce the message that tree debris should not be left at the curb. I don't understand why, as this results in cleaner looking front yards and makes for easier access for workers and shredders. But apparently they felt I was setting a bad example for my neighbors.  So I would just like a longer grace period for cleanups, especially when there's widespread power outages. I would like more clarity for residents as to when the city will and will not assist with a storm cleanup. The city website was not kept up to date. And finally, better communications between DPS and the code enforcement officials.  The same day I received the code enforcement was the same, or maybe the prior day DPS made the decision to help out residents. Thank you, Mr. Bumberg. Thank you.",Governance and Civic Engagement

And it all begins July 27th in Star JC Park, and it all closes and wraps up and everything disappears right into the night on August the 5th. If you're interested in tickets, the website's handy. Visit it, check it out. We've got new photos all the time. Many of our city leaders, including former Mayor Ellison and current Mayor Fournier have  participated on our stage sword fighting and being triumphing over at NAHAT, which I'm very proud to say. And we look forward to seeing you all this summer. All of our programs are at Shakespeare Relic is a non-profit arts organization and it's dedicated to this community. Yet we are independent of the city budget and we do rely on community support and local business sponsors.  We look forward to announcing our fundraiser, which you're all invited to join. Probably Ed will be here next time to talk about that. But we hope to see you all in the park this summer and share our magic of Shakespeare Royal Oak. Thank you. Thank you, Ms. Clark.",Arts and Culture

And my grandfather built the house in 1939. So my family has seen a lot of changes. This facility has not been, as far as I'm concerned, I support 99% of my neighbors, by the way.  This facility has not been properly managed for many, many decades. I myself was even charged with harassment at one time because of complaints about the parking. Now the parking, the city approved the parking for the facility that was there. And it's very similar to what they want to approve this time. They were going to park 15 cars in the back and 10 under the building, something like that.  The fact is, there's never been 10 cars under the building. The most I've ever seen is two cars, and that was long-term storage. And as a number of neighbors have pointed out, half the time this place is flooded. So maybe they should stock it with fish. I don't know. And then on the outside, they claim they're going to put 15 cars in the back. I've been there, as I say, decades. I've never seen 15 cars in the back.  I mean, you have to have garbage pickup, you have to have handicapped parking. And now, of course, everybody's going to be electric, right? We need a charging station. We put it outside or we put it down inside in the water. I mean, it's just unreal. I've seen this neighborhood, I've seen people, young people move in, they struggle, try to pick up, fix their property up.  People live close to this place. And I mean, when it was occupied, you couldn't park on the street. You literally couldn't park on the street. Now we have other neighbors. We have the World Women's Club, which is a historical structure. They cause no problems, really. They have a spaghetti dinner, and they have a bingo night, and they sell, have an antiques auction, and the neighbors participate.  And they don't tie up the parking. The First Presbyterian Church lets the city use their lots for art, beats, and eats, and lets neighbors park there. And not this place. This place is pushing out all of our parking. We couldn't get the streets plowed. We couldn't get the streets swept. And I mean, it's not going to get better if you do this. And over the years, I've seen the percentage of rental in Royal Oak go up. And I think it's distressing. I really do.  I don't know, they've been working on this and I don't know what they're doing. This asbestos business, it's no shock. I don't know why this was even approved by the planning. I don't understand it. I don't understand the point of it.

I'm just going to tell you a few things. They're talking about parking underground. The parking structure underground. They're saying they can put 10 cars down there and they probably can get down there.  But there's no way, if there's 10 cars down there, that they can turn around to come out. A lot of cars stopped using it because cars were bottoming out also there. So that's a concern right there.  People won't want to park down there if they're worried that their car is going to bottom out. People aren't going to want to park down there if they have to try to back out of that because they won't be able to turn around. That's one thing to think about. These owners have not shown us a good side to them. They were asked to stop  working over the summer. They did not. They kept violating that. There's asbestos in there. Black mold in there. There's children in the neighborhood. There's my husband in the neighborhood with leukemia. There's other people with health issues. And they kept working on that. Now,  They have an architect. I'm sure he's very knowledgeable. So being so knowledgeable, he knows that older buildings all have asbestos in it and has to be removed a certain way. They kept working on it. So they're not showing that they care about the neighborhood. We all live in Royal Oak. Royal Oak's a gem. It's such a gem. Don't grant  that to them just because that building's been sitting there for so long. Grant it to somebody that's showing that they love Royal Oak. And as far as affordable rental goes, they can get up here and say they're going to rent it for anything. It doesn't mean they're going to follow through with it. Just keep that all in mind, please.

I must say you have tons of knowledge from these people and I hope you listen to them.  Anyway, I'm here to remind you that the majority of the residents are very concerned about your plan. It's difficult that you would even consider creating harm to those who purchased homes in their existing neighborhoods. More who weren't aware of this before are also very concerned. We already have been through all the obvious reasons, so I don't want to get into that. There's plenty of land or buildings to use for housing here.  Nameless members stated that such housing doesn't have to be in the existing neighborhoods. Cross your fingers. I'm curious to know what you consider to be affordable. So many residents have been harmed due to permitted structures and uses, and you refuse to admit it. A few of you could be affected by this, too, when your values decrease.  As for 4th Street, are you saying that the market conditions will have negative impact if you do it something else? I'm glad to know that you care about historic merit as it disappears in the city.  Are you saying parking won't be a problem based on other multifamily dwellings in the city? Do those have very limited parking or have to use parking lots when not in use? I don't think so.

The protest petition required that at least 20% of property owners within 100 feet sign it. We have over 90% that have signed it, all not supporting the approval of such an egregious proposal. And it then will require two-thirds vote from the city commission before it goes forward. I also want to speak a little bit about why I oppose this plan.  The overlay area and future plan is established to allow otherwise nonconforming buildings with other uses predating single-family residential zoning to exist. But going forward, any new use would be single-family residential. This is mitigating the fact that the overlay area where I live and where my neighbors live is already at maximum density with multiple duplexes and apartment buildings without dedicated on-site parking, many homes without their own private driveways, and several churches with  people coming to go to church. The erroneous narrative that anyone opposing this proposal is a misanthrope, a NIMBY, a racist, or against affordable housing is inaccurate, dismissive of the actual problems that the various neighbors have provided evidence of regarding this proposal, and attacked it to divert others away from the real issue here, which is that this project is flawed. The developer is not invested in seeing this through.  And the project is not affordable housing and its density simply does not belong at 7, 1, 8, West 4th. Our neighborhood is the same as a nightclub at maximum capacity per fire code. Not letting additional patrons inside is not to exclude them from the party, but for the overall safety and enjoyment of those already inside.  I purchased my home relying on single-family residential zoning. I love my wonderful neighborhood. As an area realtor, I've sold countless other homes within this neighborhood and others. They also relied on the single-family zoning. If such an egregious plan were to be approved, it's clearly an example of spot zoning, as noted by Chairman of the Planning Commission at the January 10th Planning Commission meeting.  It would negatively impact myself and the other neighbors. I just don't understand. We're the people that vote you in. You're supposed to follow the master plan. You're supposed to follow the zoning guidelines. The ZBA should be involved. The EPA is involved now.

I am part of the neighborhood affected by the conditional rezoning of the nursing home at 718 West 4th Street, and I've lived in this neighborhood for almost 40 years.  We've realized and enjoyed the protections of the current master plan and zoning ordinance, which has protected our homes, while also allowing economic growth in the nearby downtown. I fully support the efforts of my neighbors, including Andrea Corolla, who just submitted the petition, who expected the planning and city commissions to follow their own laws and ordinances  and only allow for responsible development in our neighborhood. We believe that high density with parking in front of our houses will diminish the value of our home investments. Instead, this property should be developed with more density, or excuse me, with less density and green space at ground level. I was very disappointed when I heard the Planning Commission's recommendation to insert high density residential with insufficient parking at this location.  I feel sorry for my neighbors who are directly adjacent and the impact on their home values. If this project gets final approval, I've noticed other projects that have been approved that have negative impacts on other neighborhoods. And I feel sorry for those people too.

I urge you to take a deep dive into the specifics of the 718 West 4th Street conditional rezoning proposal.  Rewatch the January 10th Planning Commission meeting video and read the residents' comments that were provided in your packets. There are still several inconsistencies and omissions on the site plan that were cited and many other areas of concern noted by residents. The petitioner still has not specified how the proposal would meet any of the nine criteria used by the Planning Commission.  On March 23rd, you received a letter from our attorney that outlined a flawed process used by the city. There is no section of the zoning ordinance that speaks to conditional rezoning like there is for PUDs or special land use. On March 27th, I sent all of you and the city documentation of EGLE asbestos violations that need to be resolved before approval. Please ask the owner to provide a timeline and documentation for remediation.  The zoning ordinance does not contain a section that addresses conditional rezoning. The city is relying on section 405 of the Michigan Zoning Enabling Act.  There's nothing in the Zoning Ordinance or in Section 405 that gives the City authority to waive zoning violations without requiring the applicant to go to the Zoning Board of Appeals for variances. The safeguards built into the Zoning Ordinance for granting variances are being overlooked and bypassed to the detriment of adjacent property owners.  In keeping with Zoning Ordinance 770.132, we have presented a signed petition in opposition. We have 90% of the neighbors who have signed this in agreement. Objective 1.1 of our master plan, preserve, maintain, and enhance the character of existing neighborhoods.  I believe this sizable addition of so many apartments and so many zoning variances is not in character with our existing neighborhood. Please do your due diligence. Of the many proposals presented at Planning Commission, Zoning Board of Appeals, and here, this plan is one of the most incomplete and flawed I have ever seen.  I'm not against change. I too want this neglected site to be revitalized. However, this proposal is not the answer. Don't let it be a quick fix or the change that's good enough or better than nothing.

Steve Schwartz, I live at 803 West 4th Street. I'm here to speak on number 10, the property at 718 West 4th Street. And what I wanted to talk about is maybe a little bit different, but I want to talk about principles and accountability. So this property was bought 10 years ago for about $500,000.  The investor knew the zoning requirements at the time of purchase, sat on it for 10 years, did nothing. The property has continued to go downhill. We've just recently gone through a period with record low interest rates and a great real estate market. It may not be today, but it has been. During that period, also no action was taken. The investors then tried to sell the property.  for four times what they bought it for and were unsuccessful. They now turn to the city and the residents and claim a hardship and ask for deviations to the current zoning. If we look at the neighborhood, if there's anything we need, we actually need more single-family homes and kid-friendly housing, which is what it's zoned for.  What I worry about is the message and the precedent set if the city allows a wealthy investor to come in and hold the city and its residents hostage, then there's no accountability for their inaction. When I look at what has been done, there has not been anywhere near enough work done to look at making something work within the zoning that is currently zoned as. And what I request is the city not approve the deviation.  I thank you for your time.",Housing

I'm speaking to the  718 West 4th Street proposal. I urge that upon your closer examination of the 718 West 4th Street conditional rezoning proposal, including your review of the video of the January 10, 23 planning commission meeting, which included by the way, the petitioner's disorganized uninspired presentation, upon all that, you will reject this proposal.  I resided at 809 West 4th Street for the past 24 years. I have been very comfortable with the neighborhood integration of the 718 West 4th property operated as a nursing home for 70 plus residents. It did not complicate traffic flow or neighborhood street parking. And now I welcome this property to be revitalized as an assisted living residence or a convalescent home.  For all the same reasons, our neighborhood was comfortable with its use as a nursing home. Presently, my neighborhood is a nice mix of single homes, duplexes, triplexes, quads, and apartment buildings, plus some commercial enterprises. On 159 lots, we have 264 units, which includes a remarkable 60% rental units.  Obviously, we have been comfortable with our current number of renters. However, this proposal to add 25 additional units with this attendant traffic and parking needs is ludicrous. Although we are all eager to remedy the 718 West 4th property eyesore, this proposal is not an attractive solution by any means.  But rather, it's very likely to create or exacerbate problems, especially the parking capacity for this neighborhood. And Royal Oak should feel no special obligation to facilitate the poor management habits of the current owner. I advise that the commission deny or send back this proposal to the Planning Commission to identify and evaluate all factors  and then report its findings to the City Commission to address relevant issues.

Good evening, Jean Sarnacki. I'm here to speak on item 10. I'm not going to speak about spot zoning. I'm not going to speak to the fact that the approval of this project is a reward to an owner who has neglected this building for a decade. This is blight approval. This is not blight removal.  Nor will I go into the matter regarding the state and federal government and asbestos. There are cars and different people, agencies there almost every day now it seems. Or the ice rink that's there in the winter and the three or four inches of water that's down there today as I speak.  And I am disappointed that you did not get the asbestos letter and legal opinion in your packets that would make it for public comment. But instead I'm going to speak about our neighborhood, information that may be relevant to your decision making. As was just shared with you, we have 159 lots in the nine square blocks we call the overlay district. In that we have 264 units.  Single homes, duplexes, triplexes, quads, and apartment buildings. This averages out to 1.66 units per lot. We also have Sullivan Funeral Home, McDonald's, the Woylick Women's Club, whose board chair signed the petition.  We're a fairly dense area. According to the U.S. Census, overall, Royal Oak is 35% rental stock. And with the numbers I just provided, our neighborhood is essentially at 60% already. Already we're at 60%. I think adding 25 additional units is too much to ask.  Did you also know that the parking east of the nursing home building are already permit only parking for residents due to density and parking issues there. And parking is only allowed on one side of the street.  We all chose to live here because we liked the mix of housing and neighbors. The multiple units on our blocks predate our decisions to buy our homes. The notion that we do not like renters or fear them is ludicrous, as most of us live next to, across from, or a lot away from a rental.  However, it is the homeowners that are the glue here. We host the block parties. We extend invites to TGIF get-togethers on a neighbor's lawn. We remind them about leaf pickup, what snow emergencies mean, and what to do with Arts, Beats, and Eats parking.  Affordable housing was one of the reasons for this project, yet no one has asked what the anticipated rental costs will be. I would bet a few bucks that the rentals already in our neighborhood are cheaper. If salvaging this building is even now possible with all the asbestos issues and other issues, we would welcome the opportunity to talk with the architect and owner. To date, I have yet to hear from him, though promises were made at the plan commission to reach out, and the one neighbor that they did speak to  broke two, was a no-show for two meetings before he finally showed. How many neighbors longed to have a convalescent home or assisted living in their neighborhood? We know this is the past, but we think there are better options for our future. Please deny or send it back to plan commission. We can do better. Thank you. And thank you for your efforts.",Housing

Here's some truths that I have viewed over the years. You violated your own constitution, the city charter, in wrongfully denying a past valid ballot, veterans ballot petition for which you were sued into compliance. You refused to listen to the circuit court and you appealed and you lost.  you reacted by changing the local ballot initiative ordinance to allow you to subjectively decline future valid petitions. When two candidates, Gibbs and Lavoisier, won election that truly represented the people, you immediately proceeded to change the number of commissioners required to put an issue on the commission agenda from two to three.  you attempt to portray anyone who disagrees with you as right-wing radicals, as shown by this piece of campaign literature that you put out, when it seems that those of you that are acting radically by doing what you please, irrespective of the city charter and the master plan and the will of the people, are the radicals.  Your ballot proposals are riddled with deceptive and misleading language. In a recent library millage, you led the people to believe the library would fail to operate without it. It was only a bait and switch where this millage simply replaced what you would have otherwise simply distributed from the general fund.  You continue to persist with road diets when your city-sponsored survey showed a 70% rejection and my larger survey showed a 97% rejection. You do not represent the people. From public records, about 93% of your campaign contributions come from organized labor, business owners and developers, the very ones for which you approved their bids.  If you really wish to know what the residents think about your master plan, you'd put it to a vote. But you're not going to do that. You only want to push a predetermined agenda.  You are not truthful. You are not transparent. You are locked up with the most vile institution on earth by implementing the World Economic Forum's 15-minute city in Royal Oak. You are traitors to the city and its charter. You are traitors to our country and its constitution to which you feign allegiance.

I'm here in support and very concerned about my neighboring Royal Oakers. I don't live on 4th Street, but that doesn't mean I should look the other way. I couldn't live with that, just like they shouldn't have to live with what might happen to their neighborhood.  On January 10, 2023, the Planning Commission voted 3-2 to continue with the 4th Street development. This could forever disturb the quality of life for its residents, old and new. The 15-20 residents who commented that night are obviously dedicated, long-term loyal Royal Oakers, some who have been here 15-50 years.  And I'm sure the new residents would be concerned about their quality of life also. The residents' concern is the already real lack of parking. What will happen when an apartment complex is developed? During the Planning Commission's own comments, it was stated that they truly believe that the new apartment residents would most likely have one car per unit.  If that is true, and I highly doubt it, will all these new residents have no friends, relatives, loved ones, spouses, or children who might need visitor parking on a daily basis? Also, what about medical or snow emergencies?  During the Planning Commission comments, a complaint was stated because they have to drive an extra two minutes to get to their neighborhood store because of a no-through street blocking their way. That two minute less of their time has protected the low traffic flow and the safety of their neighborhood.  a great trade-off for families and children who live there. So why would they vote for making it harder to park? This could end up with people circling the neighborhood for more than two minutes to find a parking spot. Then, if they find one, might have to walk several blocks home.  Not respectful, especially for young handicapped people, seniors, children, or people that don't feel safe walking several blocks of uneven sidewalks in the dark or bad weather. Will they get ticketed if they give up and park where they can? It was also very disturbing to read online the minutes from the January 10th meeting. It never mentions the major opposition of this project. Why was that left out?  I end with a Commissioner's comment on this project and I quote, in this case every single person who spoke was opposed to it and every single person lives in the neighborhood. I think that does carry some weight because they live there and we didn't hear anything on the other side and that's a concern to me. The street system doesn't sound like it can accommodate extra parking and they  kept on saying to this, the petitioner is not entitled. They've got the burden and he hasn't made his case.

First off, I'd like to talk about the ballot proposal for the road millage. Last time we had this, there was a scope of work along with it. All the streets that were supposed to be repaved and when were actually part of the whole proposal. I don't see one here. Why not? I'd also like to find out how much of that initial plan was actually completed.  Are we 70% done? 50% done? We need more money? Why? And in this particular issue, I mean, we originally voted on this millage to take care of the residential side streets because the amount of money coming from the state as far as road improvement funds was much less than we needed and there was no actual funds dedicated from the general fund to take care of residential streets.  This proposal says, ah, we'll put it wherever we need it. That could include road diets. It could be called made streets. It could be almost anything. I think what we need to do, if you want to have a road millage for residential streets, say so. If you're not going to do that, state why you're not going to do that. And in any case, we need a scope of work. Just giving you money is not going to cut it anymore.  With regards to the proposal on the 4th Street, I did watch the entire planning committee meeting and the developer was actually asking for ideas. He was fully reasonable to say maybe assistant living would be perfectly fine with the owner. So all of you here are always on your campaign literature saying that you're for seniors. We wanna do something for seniors. Here's your chance.  Okay, the neighborhood doesn't want small micro apartments in their neighborhood. They are willing to accept, from all the comments I saw at that meeting, an assistant living facility or even a senior living facility, if not a nursing home, but at least something along that line.  Why are we bringing this forward with a micro apartment unit of extremely high density and virtually no parking? If this was such a big deal, why wasn't this put forward at the building's place, at 855, at the, I can't remember all the other ones that are on Main Street that just came in. Why are we sticking this in the neighborhood? You had your chance to do this on Main Street, you had the chance to do this on Washington, which are fairly large thoroughfares, and you didn't.  So why are we stuffing it in the neighborhood now? I'm really concerned if we do this spot conditional zoning, no place in the city is going to be safe. You can do anything you want. Single family housing is done. Zoning is done. You get enough people on a planning commission to override it. That's wrong. You should have a plan, a master plan and stick to it. And this doesn't do it. Thank you.",Transportation and Mobility

I'm here to talk about item number 10 718 West 4th Street. So for now, let's put aside that the proposal requires rezoning of the location, as well as require approval of nine deviations to the world master plan.  and the building violations of the developer. Let's talk numbers. There's roughly one to two blocks length on 4th Street between Hendry and Southwest. And along that stretch, there are 29 housing units, 19 of which are single-family homes.  Five of the units are duplexes. There's one, I'll call it a multifamily rehabilitation unit on the corner of West. And there are five apartment units that today offer a total of 42 apartments in just that one to two block area. 35 or 83% of those apartments offer no parking.  So as mentioned many times before, when there's insufficient or no parking offered by developers, our neighborhood streets are the parking lots. Essentially, there's already a two-to-one ratio of apartments to single-family housing along 4th Street, with many additional duplexes, apartments, and rentals down the side streets of Southwest, South Laurel, South Pleasant, and South Maple. So what do the numbers tell us? The numbers tell us that adding 25 high-density units  at 718 West 4th would increase the number of apartments along 4th Street to 67. That would increase the percentage of apartments by 60% and expand the apartment to single family home ratio on 4th Street from 2 to 1 to 3 to 1. There would be 75% apartments and 25% other housing types.  I have to inject we're not downtown Detroit or downtown Chicago and don't require such density and don't want to, no desire to do that. Residents of the awesome neighborhood and surroundings of 718 West 4th are content with the mix of existing apartments, duplexes, single family housing, rentals that have been integrated into our neighborhoods for decades.  Not just on 4th Street, but again on the surrounding streets. We feel that our neighborhood already offers more than enough high and mixed density housing options. This isn't a not in my backyard pushback.  This is, and I'm already here, it's already been in my backyard for decades, reality. And we don't need to add more high density apartments to throw off the balance. Let's work together to find better options, willing to do that and open to other ideas for this location.

My name is Mark Nave, and I live 309 South Maple Avenue, four houses up from South 18 West 4th, whose petition I'd like to speak against this evening. I really appreciate my neighbors' comments tonight that touched on many details of this proposal. I want to zoom out and look at some general principles that I want to invite you to think about when you start deliberating about this petition that's going to be before you.  To be really clear, this petition is asking for special treatment. They're asking for you to create a new right for them that, by their own admission, at planning commission, will be immensely valuable, potentially worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. I braise that, not to say that that's something you shouldn't do, but to clarify, the neighbors are not here to ask their government to restrict the rights of a property owner. We're here to ask our government to exercise scrutiny before creating a new right for a wealthy investor. Second, conflicts about property rights are always zero-sum games.  You're going to create a new right for one person. You're taking away another right. And the right that you're taking away is the right to live under the master plan with the existing overlay district. And to clarify, the right that's involved there, that's a right to democratic governance. The master plan is a document, right? It's a plan created through a deliberative, community-engaged process. It is the most democratically legitimate way we have to do zoning. Again, maybe it's OK to deviate from that.  we should have really good reason. In particular, I would suggest to you, when you're considering this proposal, that you look for benefits that are overwhelming, that are obvious, and that are widely shared. I don't want to go over things my neighbors have said. I think reasonable people can disagree about a lot of things, including about this petition that's before you today. But I do think there's sufficient evidence that the benefits are not obvious, the benefits are not overwhelming, and the benefits are not going to be widely shared.

I'm coming to you tonight because I'm coming as a representative of the planning Commission in the city of Huntington Woods as a former member of the ZBA of Huntington Woods and as a realtor who finds what's going on on 4th Street just really something that shouldn't be happening at all as Andrea put it.  This is spot zoning. There is no condition conditional zoning that's allowed in the ordinances for you to go over it was an overlay and that's all that it was and if it doesn't continue in its use it should revert back to its original use of residential.  Looking to see what some of the recommendations were from the Planning Commission, it said there's an demand in the city for affordable and transitional housing for young people, single professionals, seniors seeking to age in place and others. Gee, 25 units and only one of them is ADA compliant. Is the elevator right? Let's talk about the lack of parking. You know, that's one per unit and yes,  You know, it is going to affect the city, you know, and the streets and the residents around it. They're already using permanent parking for their driveways that don't work out for them. And it's going to have a tremendous overflow. Converting it to multiple families that you need more of? Gee, didn't the Griffin billing place and your number 12,  I think it is, oh, excuse me, 14 for North Main with, you know, the PUD unit going in there, give you more, you know, density and more units. You don't need more units. This neighborhood needs to be preserved. The people who live there and who have bought there want to maintain their neighborhoods. It will affect the values of their property.  I can't believe that you would ask the two residents to live behind the alley, which will serve as a driveway and it should not be doing it for 25 spaces of which 10 downstairs in the basement are underwater today. You know, what kind of fencing they want? One person doesn't want a fence.  and the other person wants posts and bushes and bushes and then nothing. What would it be like along I-75 if you ask the neighbors on Stevenson what kind of fence do you want backing up and they all ask for something different.

I lived in downtown Royal Oak for the last six years. I have seen in the summer and in the spring the decline of people in downtown. It is amazing how many people do not come down to downtown.  I know how much this commission has enjoyed or pushing to park in parking garages. Let me tell you, seniors will never park in parking garages. That's a fact. Also, young people coming down here,  will not park in parking garages, especially young women who come down, four or five women in a car like they used to park on the street, they will not park in the parking garages. So pushing this parking garage deal for a good deal is a bad idea. Second, the more and more you delay,  and getting rid of those parking meters on Washington and on Center, those streets are dying. There are less people shopping. There are people still parking headfirst into those parking instead of back in. And I notice on the accidents, the amount of time that  Those meters have been in and those accidents is as much as six years of parking in head first. That does not mean it's safer as you all thought it would be. It is more hazardous and people have trouble backing in.  So the more you delay, the more those businesses die, and the more you're going to lose more businesses. Also, this 15 minutes is a must, especially around Royal Oak Manor and other businesses, because as I said before, you can't park on Williams Street, run into our building, drop off some food to your grandmother or mother who is sick,  and get back to your car in five minutes. You must be Superman or the Flash if you can make it from them up to the floor and back down in five minutes. It's impossible. So 15 minute grace period is a must if you're gonna keep those meters, but I suggest you get rid of them. It was a bad choice that means somebody did not do their homework and look at other cities that are getting rid of it. Thank you.",Transportation and Mobility

I was greeted by Jim Geierman. I let him know I was requesting he not be in my Tax Board of Appeal meeting. He let me know he intended to sit on that meeting, no matter my request. He then let me know he knows all of the laws, all of the rules, and he's been doing this a long time. His behavior requires me to ask two questions to this commission.  Number one, the city pushed for a law to allow Jim Geierman to not be present during Tax Board of Appeals meetings. My request was well within the law. Jim was fully able to honor my request. What was Jim's impartial legal reason for turning down my request? Second question, the Tax Board of Appeals is required to operate and formulate decisions independent of Jim Geierman. Its entire purpose for existing is because the state acknowledges mistakes in property tax assessments happen.  Residents who have invested in this community are coming to the tax appeal with the sole purpose of pointing out assessment mistakes. If they are greeted with statements by Jim Geierman that he knows all the rules, he knows all the laws, and he's been doing this a long time, do you think he is making that statement in an effort to encourage residents to point out assessing mistakes?  Or is it more likely he made that statement in an effort to intimidate residents and cause them to lose hope in ever correcting their taxation to a level deemed accurate and legal by the state constitution? Between 2007 and 2019, this city taxed the people owning its lowest cost homes at a rate 1.66 times higher than the highest cost homes.  There are many reasons this happened, all of which are being dissected by many, many professionals inside and outside the state who might not have all of the rules and all of the laws memorized, but are good enough at it that they have earned PhDs in their fields and now advise state and federal legislature on what is and isn't legal.

My name is Zane Dufour. I live at 415 Oak Run Court in Royal Oak. I have a couple of different things I want to bring up. The first one is not on the agenda, but it's a personal gripe of mine. It would be really nice if there was bike parking clearly visible in the parking lot down there. I rode my bike here today, and I was kind of surprised that I ended up having to lock my bike  along with another one down at the bottom of the stairs over there. It wouldn't cost that much. And I think it would be a really nice positive impact in a way for the city to kind of lead the way in providing for alternative forms of mobility. The next thing I want to bring up is just that No Mo' May sounds really cool.  I don't know about it, but you should vote yes on that proposal. The third is about what is probably going to be a contentious issue today, which is topic 10 on the agenda, the rezoning of 718 West 4th Street. I would urge the commission to vote in favor of the planned rezoning. It's like on almost every metric that  someone could reasonably bring up, the plan seems to meet the needs of housing's greatest critics, except for people who are just opposed to people. People who are misanthropes, who don't like other people being near them. And that's sort of fine, because on some sense I understand, because people make noise, and they have birthday parties, and they have kids who ride their bikes on the sidewalks.  If you're opposed to more of that around you, then you can go live somewhere where there's less of that. You can sell your property and move somewhere else. If you're opposed to people being near you, then I guess you can oppose 10. But I'm in favor of people. I think Royal Oak is great. And I think it would be great with more neighbors. Yeah. So that's my kind of pitch for voting yes on topic 10. Thank you very much.",Housing

But I'm pretty sure that as of July 1st, that's going to decrease by 7.9%. And so when the people go to vote in November, that's going to be incorrect on the ballot.

I'm here this evening to speak about sustainability and climate action plan metrics. I wish to remind each of you that when the sustainability and climate action plan was adopted last May,  The commission requested City Manager Brake to develop, track, and communicate metrics so that the commission could monitor progress of the plan's implementation, and he agreed.  In an effort to fulfill this request, Assistant City Manager Barkman is scheduled to present Royal Oaks Planned Internet Dashboard to the Environmental Advisory Board at their April 26th meeting. Not sure you're aware of it, just wanted to make sure you were aware. In preparation for this presentation,  and the discussion that is scheduled to follow the EAB Sustainability and Climate Action Plan Task Force has been meeting and emailing about metrics. The task force wants to make sure that key SCAP metrics adequately address the city's greenhouse gas emission reduction goals, that they are clearly defined and have reliable existing data sources.  As a key metric, I am advocating for is a per capita residential greenhouse gas emissions quantity resulting from natural gas and electricity consumption. It is one third of the community's total 2018 greenhouse gas emissions. If our residents don't know they are part of the problem, how can we expect them to be part of the solution?  I'm hopeful that following the EAB meeting, Assistant City Manager Barkman's draft Royal Oak Dashboard incorporates recommendations provided by the SCAP Task Force, and  that final versions of this dashboard are approved by the EAB and the city commission. Having EAB and city commission approval of a key ASCAP metrics is a necessary step towards gaining needed broader community support. Please be prepared to engage in this process that moves forward.

There's market pressures around and  There's market pressures around, and there's certainly a demand for all types of housing. So it'd just be a matter of time that something would be going in there, he said. It could be more units. It could be a taller building, he continued.

This is the local government. Quit trying to scare people.  That's how I feel about it. You're trying to put fear in them.

A resident of almost 40 years spoke against the project. She said the city has been enjoyed, and the protections of the current master plan and zoning ordinance, which protected their homes, would also allow economic growth in the downtown, but feels the development would have a negative effect on the neighborhood. Okay, I feel that way too.  I don't live in that area, but I went to Don Darrow. I graduated in 62. The beginning of this meeting, the first two speakers were amazing. It was so heartwarming to hear about Victoria, how she loved this all-American city that I grew up in. And the library, speaking about the library, that lady that runs the library is amazing.

I have half of what I'm going to say this evening. By reading the agenda for tonight's meeting, we learned that the neighborhood protest petition that we submitted was certified by the city. While we were confident that it would be, we had hoped that the city would at least notify us. And now that we are in a process where this is being extended out with an unknown timeline,  I hope there's better communication as we are now active participants and how you all will be voting on this in the near future, hopefully near future. I am requesting some clarification for this process now that you have a delay. If the petitioner does come back with a PUD proposal or conditional zoning request that looks very different from the original proposal, will it need to go back  To the Planning Commission again, ZBA, it seems like it should. How big of a change would cause this to be sent back to the Planning Commission and who will decide? How will we be notified and how much notice will be given? So I think these are some fairly significant questions.  This building, this site, can be so much more than what has been presented to date. I did recently sign a petition by one of my neighbors regarding the possibility of townhouses or condos that are sized to match the neighborhood, and she covered a far wider area than the initial petition that has modified your voting. It was getting great support from the residents that reside, that she was able to speak with. Even after 10 years of neglect,  We still have a vision that we hope our leaders, you, can embrace. I myself am also in support of an adult foster care facility, something that was brought to my attention as a need in Royal Oak by a former member of the senior advisory committee. More so than the rentals, as we are already at 60% in our neighborhood, which I suspect is significantly more than any of you have in your immediate neighborhoods.  Please say no to this project and encourage the owners to present something more in line with the single or multi-family zoning without the outrageous variances. And I also want to let you know that as an update, since the last city commission meeting, the petitioner has made no attempt to still contact or engage with neighbors. This, despite several of you suggesting it and a couple of our neighbors actually speaking to them after the last meeting, they reached out. This is consistent  with the petitioner's behavior since the beginning. And of course, the owner, hopefully he's caring for patients in Dearborn. But anyway, thank you very much this evening.

I'd like to back up Mr. Harrison's plan for the parking on Washington and Center Streets, the back end. You do not need it.  All you need to do is change what you have out there. All you have to do is put your license plate number in. It already knows what parking spot you're on. And because of the new hours, you will attract more people by parking head in. You continue this back end parking, even though you increase the hours, you will lose Washington and Center Street.  It's an easy thing to do. If you can do it in the kiosks on the flat parking lots, you should be able to do it on all the back ends. Either the company won't do it or not capable of doing it, which means they don't have the talent or the programming. It's a simple thing to do. I spent over 40 years programming.  I started with key punching and worked up to programs. I was a senior programmer and systems analyst. I talked to users all the time. I solved their problems. This main problem that we have with this century is because somebody who thought there was a terrific plan did not do their due diligence and check out other cities that have this and are now finding out these cities are getting rid of this system.  This falls only on that person and this commission for not doing their due diligence. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Ashley.",Transportation and Mobility

I'm here to talk about the median sidewalk project that is on today's agenda.  Overall I support the program but I would like to present a few options that I believe are more aligned with the city's master plan of neighborhood connectivity while reducing the impacts to some of the property owners. Just making sure you guys all have the handout. So the first option is to eliminate the portion of the sidewalk in the right of way at 1115 Vincette and that's location one as shown  on the information provided from the engineering department and I'm suggesting this for a couple reasons and would like to note that this location is unique in that it is not a corner lot. First the sidewalk is located towards the center of the property which in my opinion is visually unappealing. I'm sure very few of us have a driveway that is in the middle of our lot as well and the second reason is I believe the sidewalk would get minimal use  From living in this home for several years, the vast majority of people who cross the road are traveling to and from the north. Pedestrians currently use the driveway to cross the road and they would continue to do so even if the sidewalk was constructed. They would typically use the wider, more direct route and it's kind of shown as the red dash line on that exhibit there. The second option is to locate the sidewalk on the north side of the driveway.  Again, location one per the engineering department's assessment. And this option addresses two of the concerns. The sidewalk is located towards the edge of the lot and it encourages pedestrians to use the sidewalk in lieu of the driveway as it is positioned more appropriately to the higher volume of pedestrian travel. And then the third option is  to connect the sidewalks from Fairlawn to Lawndale. And that's locations one and two on the engineering department's report. And this is shown on the rear of the handout, flip it over, with the green lines. And this option solves the concerns noted earlier while creating opportunities for community engagement such as an area for benches or historical markers. As I understand the Historical District Study Committee is currently going through the bridges on Vincetta as part of that program.  And today a fair amount of people use the median to cross directly from Fairlawn and Lawndale and this would give them a safer path to do so. And I believe this option likely influences the largest quantity of pedestrians by supporting their normal walking behaviors. And with that, thank you so much for your consideration and all that you do for the city and I hope that I may have been able to present some information that is useful during your decision making process. Thank you very much.",Transportation and Mobility

It appears that the surface parking lot style kiosks are not generating complaints as we've seen on the street. These kiosks require entering the vehicle license plate number. Photos are taken as the vehicle enters and leaves the service lot. There's a 15 minute grace period and time can be added via cell phone.  Why not replace the on-street kiosks with the type used in the surface lots? That would perhaps fix the problem. Regarding your appointment today that was on the consent agenda, it's interesting that you are appointing your enforcer to the Planning Commission before the lawsuit for assault is adjudicated.  Regarding the hiring of 11 new employees, since you folks assumed control in 2013, administrative services have increased by 72%, city manager's staff has increased by 180%, the property tax millage has increased by 52.4%, and now you want to add 11 more employees.  Anyway, regarding the master plan, how many residents are really aware that the new master plan will not be subject to a public vote? And why does page 36 of the McKenna report mention the 15-minute city, a concept being promoted in Europe by Klaus Schwab, a devout communist, president of the World Economic Forum? Don't understand it.  I have previously referred to Royal Oak as the Socialist Republic of Royal Oak when people ask me where I live. It is also an ineptocracy, and that is a system of government where the least capable lead are elected by the least capable of producing  and where members of society least likely to sustain themselves or succeed are rewarded with goods and services paid for by the confiscation of wealth from the diminished number of producers.

RO_04_24_23,RO,"Royal Oak, MI",2023-04-24,2023-04-01,Training,Public Comment,Commenter,9074.0,9255.0,"Rodney Katan, homeowner at 507 South Laurel Street, Royal Oak for the last 31 years. Two weeks ago you were presented with the request for possible rezoning at 718 West 4th Street to be multifamily zoned and I'm here to request that you deny it and the site plan.  I was encouraged, though, by the insightful questioning from several of the city commissioners at your last meeting, and I came here to thank you for that and to kind of add on to where you went there. Commissioner Duboc quickly focused last time on the rationale or justification for the rezoning, specifically paragraphs A through G at the beginning of the motion.  We learned through the Commissioner's questioning that, this is a direct quote from that meeting, quote, all those conditions, meaning paragraphs A through G, all those conditions we interpreted from the Planning Commissioner's statements about approval, end of quote. Simply put, those conditions, or so-called rationale A through G, were composed after the 3-2 vote to approve, and were later inserted into the official motion that you have before you.  January 10th planned commission meeting recording provides confirmation. So I'm saying that regardless of how you intend to vote, I believe paragraphs A through G should be removed from the motion because process integrity matters.  Secondly, second reason to remove these from the motion is that these seven assertions are written with authority and may sound like they're based on fact, that they're evidence-based, that they're backed by actual documentation, but case in point, they're really not. Case in point is that, and I'm quoting from paragraph B, demolishing the existing building and redeveloping the property with single-family dwellings is not economically feasible, end of quote.  Last time, Commissioner DeBuck asked, is that fact based on fact? The answer he got was they, meaning the petitioner, didn't come to us with financial documents to demonstrate that. In fact, the petitioner has never submitted such documents or even tried to make such an argument to justify why they have financial hardship if they try to comply with existing zoning. The Planning Department confirmed that for me.  And I think closer examination of the other six rationale, you'll find, you'll be able to likely uncover more flimsy justifications. So the third thing I'd like to say about this, why you should get rid of paragraphs A through G is that most of the assertions don't have a direct connection, they don't have a direct connection to the actual proposal. Said another way, these appear to be rationale in search of a project rather than rationale that support this particular project.  For example, last time many of you questioned the validity of paragraph D relating to affordable housing. So, three reasons to reject it. Lack of process integrity, lack of evidence-based rationale or documentation, and lack of connection between the so-called rationale and either this project or our wonderful neighborhood west of West Street. I invite you to come visit us and actually learn what a great neighborhood we have. We are quite welcoming. Thank you.",Housing

My comments concern 718 West 4th Street. I support the petitioner's request to postpone until a future meeting. Hopefully they'll make an effort to meet with the neighborhood group. They have vocalized this desire multiple times at the Planning Commission and here, yet have not made any effort to do so.  It would also give them an opportunity to decide what their plans actually are, since the current site plan is very vague. During the Planning Commission public hearing in January and at the April 10th City Commission meeting, the parties for the petitioner disagreed, argued, contradicted one another regarding all the aspects of the proposal's design and vision.  Many options were verbalized, yet none of them are on the plans and none of them are in the written proposal. I also ask that you hold a public hearing regarding this proposal before any final decision is made. It would provide an opportunity for the petitioner to present updated, more detailed site plans, for more focused comments from citizens who may be impacted by this project,  and for an update on a lot of new information that has come to light since the initial public hearing and the planning commission four months ago. I could support a reduced number of units that fit a multifamily residential zoning, but the standards would not have to require a vast number of exceptions like the current proposal.

First of all, thank you for the nice invocation by Councilor Hunt mentioning Earth Day. That's one of the reasons I'm here today is that we do have a great program in our city for collecting recyclables from residences. I think we need to have stronger rules around apartment buildings here downtown having recycled bins as well. I've been finding myself throwing away a lot of glass  And while we do have a recycling facility, it's not really practical for your average person to get all that stuff there. The other thing too is, this is actually, and don't worry, I'm not gonna start complaining about it. This is just a question of fact. When is our current parking contract until? Can that be answered? I just was curious.  I've been working on some art and I really liked the old meters and how cool they looked. I don't know if our contract allows us to do something similar with our posts.  or meters, or if that's, you know, if this is kind of the hardware as a service model kind of thing where we can't do those kind of modifications, I'd like to suggest that if we're not allowed to, if we do renew that, we have some flexibility there.

I'm here to talk about two topics. My first topic is regarding the proposal. It was 15 to 20 years ago at 718 West 4th Street. I believe they wanted to put in 16 condos, which is actually nine fewer than what's being proposed today. I wanted to share why I disagreed with the proposal back then.  It was because the design included 16 balconies on the backside of the units, which essentially would have looked directly into my kitchen and backyard, as well as those of my neighbors, invading our privacy. If the proposed design excluded the balconies or had fewer units, I would have supported it. Which leads me to my second topic, which is the current proposal for that location. The owner of the site hasn't attended the city meetings.  But the architect and developer have, at multiple meetings since January, they've emphasized that they're willing to work with the city and the neighbors to design and develop something desirable and amenable to the neighborhood. I'd really hope that would happen, but unfortunately, to my knowledge, they have not reached out to the neighbors for input.  For the past several meetings I've attended, I've shared my views as to why I don't support the current proposal for 25 apartments at 718 Westworth, but I haven't really spoken about what I think would be acceptable. So I spent a good part of this past weekend going door to door to talk to my neighbors on 4th Street, on Oakdale, South Maple, South Pleasant, and South Laurel.  to get their opinion and to see if they would support and sign the simple petition I created which I forwarded on. My petition opposes the current proposal but welcomes other less dense housing options such as condos, townhomes or single family homes.  at 718 West 4th. As I was going through the neighborhood, unfortunately a lot of people weren't home. Many were renters versus homeowners, and some weren't willing to open the door to a stranger, which is understandable, of course. However, of the neighbors I did talk to, more than 85% were happy and grateful to sign my petition. If I had another day, I'm sure I could have gotten at least 25 more signatures. I got 49.  Like myself, what I heard from the homeowners surrounding the area is that they have invested their blood, sweat, and tears into their homes. They've invested their livelihoods into their homes and have lived in them from between 5 and 60 years. They don't want to see 25 more apartments on 4th Street. It's a residential neighborhood. We already have apartments, duplexes, and rentals throughout. However, the residents would embrace having lower-density condos, townhomes, or single-family homes.  that blend into the neighborhood. I feel strongly that with the right design and materials developing of any of these options would provide a significant return on the investment of the investor and owner. I ask that the commission reject the current proposal and I thank you for your time and the opportunity to express my opinion. Thank you for those excellent comments.",Housing
RO_04_24_23,RO,"Royal Oak, MI",2023-04-24,2023-04-01,Training,Public Comment,Commenter,9389.0,9575.0,"Hi, Andrea Carollo, I live at 611 West 4th. I'm here to voice my opposition to the proposal for 718 West 4th. Obviously the city is in the process of developing a new master plan but until that is done we have to remember that the current master plan is still in effect and it does not support the approval of this proposal whatsoever.  What's interesting is that the consulting firm our city has hired for the master plan revision process actually provided advice to another Michigan community regarding a developer's rezoning proposal there. Guess what that advice was? That they should follow the current master plan whenever possible. If a developer wants to rezone inconsistent with the master plan, then they need to make a compelling case as to why the rezoning would benefit the community. Rezoning needs to hold value for the residents. How can that be said of this proposal? Look at how many people show up to every single meeting.  thus far. Meanwhile, where is that petitioner? To oppose it. It's not affordable housing, it's not designated senior housing, it's not LEED certified environmentally friendly. In fact, they violated environmental demolition rules and were cited by EGLE. The only benefit of approving this proposal would be to the negligent developer's pocketbook.  I have so many questions regarding this proposal. Number one, why is the petitioner saying it's not just, we don't want to do that? Considered an acceptable response when asked by the commissions why they aren't pursuing a plan to use the building as a convalescent home, which it would be approved to be used for. Two, why is the petitioner saying it won't work financially? An acceptable response without any further research.  or data when asked by the commissions why they would not consider new development that is permitted by zoning and the master plan, or pursue approval of a less egregious multifamily proposal that's better suited to the neighborhood. I have proof here that it actually could financially work. Houses are selling for over a million dollars, built on lots paid for $270,000. The Harrison was selling at $375 a square foot for new construction condos. It can work.  Why aren't we asking for additional addresses of the petitioner's previous projects or more precise information regarding their true intent? They actually refer to the units as hotel-sized. Does that mean we're going to end up with a motel? The petitioner's presentation reminds me of John Lovett's pathological liar sketch on Saturday Night Live in that they kept revising the responses to fit what they thought we'd want to hear. Continued work with this devil that we know either makes us look really stupid or complicit.  The comparison of the amber on 11 is also completely not accurate. It's on 11 Mile, it's next to a used car dealership. And lastly, something is better than nothing is not a legitimate argument in support of this heinous proposal. Rules, laws, zoning, they exist for a reason. They are the objective guidelines that our elected public officials are supposed to follow when deciding to approve or deny a proposal, not a subjective proverb.  But if that's not what we're going to do, then maybe we need to change our city slogan to Royal Oak, where something is better than nothing.",Urban Development

I gave a book to the commission. I gave it to the clerk.  and I kept one and gave one to the clerk just for you guys to look through.

One reason I moved to Royal Oak almost 40 years ago was for the City of Trees. Unfortunately, my neighborhood alone has lost more than 70 mature trees just in one small section due to development. DTE also came in to trim and take down more trees.  They left a notice saying they might be on your block to trim, but with no specific time. One morning at 8 a.m. without notice, a DTE worker knocked at my door about tree trimming. I lucked out because I could be home all day, but many of my neighbors could not, and in some cases my neighbors came home with a beloved tree totally hacked without notice. It was shocking.  First of all it's not healthy to trim a tree in 90 plus degree weather, which it was, and a tree can go into shock and are more susceptible to disease. DTE's mission was not to save or properly trim any trees. I quote from a worker,  We can't be coming back all the time to trim trees. It costs too much money and if we cut them way back we can wait years. So that's what they did to a neighbor who wasn't home. They cut their tree way back so far that it had turned into the Leaning Tower of Pisa.  Now it has a bigger chance of falling towards their house due to DTE's hacking the branches too far away from the lines. What sense did that make? It wasn't the workers fault. That's what they were instructed to do. The workers in my yard were respectful with good results because I was there. Many other neighbors had half jobs also and you can see this throughout the city. Unfortunately the cost of tree trimming or taking down a dead tree  usually ranges between $2,000 to $5,000. Believe me, I know. I've done major tree trimming to my majestic mature tree five times in 20 years. I can't afford it anymore. I don't think many people can. That's why I'm asking you to look into what Detroit is implementing. An $8 million tree cleanup for homeowners. Priority was given to seniors, residents with disabilities, veterans, et cetera.  A city council member remarked he had waited so long to trim a big tree he ended up paying $7,000. An arborist with Detroit's general service added, and I quote, Detroit was known as the city of trees. We had a really aggressive tree care and maintenance program with crews that all they did was care, keyword care, for trees. Then that disappeared. It's come back to Detroit. Could Royal Oak work this into a master city tree maintenance plan?  Royal Oak, the City of Trees, can come back for its residents and mature trees. Great idea Detroit and I also want to thank you for the Senior Roses program. I use it and it's tremendous. Thank you.",Environment and Sustainability

And what I wanted to address the council tonight about was the construction work that's being done on Vincetta Boulevard. It appears to me that the choice of the bump outs in the curbing has been, from my view and a lot of the views of other residents, unilateral.  I don't have much opinion on what goes on in the downtown area where the buildings are tall, but I'm of the opinion that in neighborhoods and residential areas where we live, it should be up to us how our cities, our communities, our homes, our blocks look, feel, and work. After speaking with a couple of neighbors unofficially, just casually,  seem to be somewhat of a consensus developing that most people are not happy with the bump outs. For that reason I started knocking on doors. I put together a little petition. I've had very little time in on this. Approximately six hours of door knocking spread out over two and a half days. I accumulated 40 signatures  for people that are very unhappy about the bump outs. There was six to seven fence sitters, indifferent. Two of those, I suggested that they don't sign the petition and the reason for that was they hadn't walked down and seen what the bump outs looked like. I said, well, if you don't see them, I don't see how you can have an opinion either way, so don't sign the petition. Two people liked them very much.  One of them happened to be Commissioner Paroosh, which I didn't know she resided at that residence that I'm on. But if you do the math completely objective, from the signatures I obtained, it worked out in the parking lot in the truck to 83% disapproval rating on the bump-outs. Now I propose that this is going to cause a problem  for stuff like emergency services. I don't think you're going to get the E1 down around these bump outs. The snow plowing is going to be difficult. I'm a contractor. It might prove a little difficult for me to service these beautiful homes in the area in which I live. If anybody wanted to bring a camper or a boat home to get it ready for vacation, that might be out. Again, it comes down to  fiduciary responsibility and being good stewards of our money. And I was told about a seven-person focus group that decided this. Who is on the focus group? We don't know. So we'd like something done about this before it gets paid in and the ship is safe.

I live at 910 East Windermere and this is my first ever public comment, so I hope you'll be patient with me. I am here today to speak, hopefully not too late,  on the rezoning of 718 West 4th Street. I just recently began seeing signs in my neighborhood against the matter and I looked into it. I was disappointed to learn that my neighbors are against the rezoning. This may be shocking as I am a youth and normally we are in favor of preserving our property values. However,  My introduction to zoning laws came when I was a young lawyer representing low-income tenants in the San Francisco Bay Area. You may be familiar with the housing crisis that has been going on there for years. The biggest issue facing my clients was a complete inability to find housing. Creating opportunities for multifamily housing and increased density is crucial for us to have a sustainable, growth-focused community moving forward. As Commissioner Colo said in his pointing invocation, diversity is our strength. That includes diversity of housing and income levels.  Zoning laws, in fact, have been characterized as the replacement for racial redlining. I think that history is important as we consider zoning and rezoning proposals. Additionally, the City's Master Plan calls for providing a balanced residential environment and with an eye towards sustainability, and multifamily, higher density housing is key to those goals.  Multifamily housing conserves energy resources in multiple ways, from sharing walls to conserve gas and heat, to creating closer access to the businesses downtown, conserving transportation energy resources. Not to mention the reuse of an existing building, which conserves building resources and the energy required to create them. Modern problems require modern solutions, and increasing density in the area is a modern, sensible solution. Thank you for your time. Thank you, Ms. Denham.",Housing

I understand that you're countering the no to rezoning signs by claiming that the master plan outcome is not predetermined.  We have listened to you for two years talking about urbanization, the missing middle in housing, accessory dwelling units, and affordable housing without defining what that means. Every consultant that you interviewed supported urbanization. The selected consultants pushed the elimination of single-family zoning in Holland, Michigan. Their Birmingham  Michigan final master plan continues to push accessory dwelling units for further study. Page 36 of their summary report mentions the 15-minute city, a concept proposed worldwide by devout communist Klaus Schwab.  The city manager alluded to zoning changes during the budget meetings when justifying the request for a management analyst to assist with human rights commissions, sustainability, aging in place, and special projects as needed.  I am concerned to hear that the charrettes will include a group of stakeholders in addition to the consultants. This is the same approach that you used for Centennial Park. The concern is that these stakeholders will be supportive of your agenda. Will these meetings be charrettes or charades?  I'm further concerned that the residents at large do not realize that they will not have the opportunity to vote on the master plan. Speaking of the Human Rights Commission, I have no objection to the ordinance. Laura, when running for a third term as a commissioner, actually campaigned  on creating a Human Rights Ordinance, and I have rendered to both lesbians and gays. Why do we need a Human Rights Commission in addition to the Human Rights Ordinance, given that there have not been any violations of the ordinance? I am concerned about the possibility of a misuse of power. And of course, power is your word, not mine.

The advisory board met last night and was pleased to  Last night, this was Thursday, so I'm at Thursday, was pleased to see the list of projects that was included in the budget this year and we talked about how to make sure that the residents can see the impact of the two millages that they passed this year supporting both parks and our seniors. We believe that these very visible parks projects I listed above demonstrate the city's commitment to the parks and we are in a way to thank the residents for their support in passing the millages.  It is my understanding that the Parks Millage covers the $1.5 million cost of Parks and Recreation operational costs that was previously covered by the General Fund. As the operational costs are now being covered by the Millage, the Board and I feel very strongly that the General Fund should continue to be earmarked for Park projects, as we promised when talking about the Millage.  In addition, we consider what would be considered visible signs for the senior millage as suggested by Commissioner Perut in the budget meeting. At that moment, the budget only is spending senior millage money on senior services, nothing from the general fund. A really nice overlap for both millages would be park-related pieces that are also part of our aging in place plan, like the park benches, picnic tables, and ADA nature trails. This would serve to make Royal Oak more accessible to all ages and abilities.  Looking at the associated costs at all of these, we are requesting an additional $200,000 be earmarked towards the importance and visible projects as a reflection of the work being done with the millage dollars approved by the royal voters.

Prior to that, there's been some early college games that have been going on with Rochester College, I believe, Macomb Community College used the field one time, and it's been really a great opportunity for these programs. I am working real hard and trying to get OCC to bring back their baseball program.

This street gets very little traffic and there's no, the side of the street that has no sidewalk has no access to any buildings. It abuts the back of the ACE hardware and the  CVS and it's fenced so there's literally no access. In addition it's a lovely green space. It appears that the owners have planted in the last recent times very nice shrubbery and bushes along the entire fence and there are some mature trees on that property one of which if there was a sidewalk put in I was looking at today I'm not sure how they'd  go around that sidewalk. The houses across the street have front porches with chairs on them, so the people there sit on the porches and look out. And the view of a green space, in my opinion, is really much nicer than looking at concrete sidewalks.  I might even suggest that we would put a couple benches. There's a grouping of mature trees and if we would put a bench or two in that area, people who are walking their dogs may have a place to sit and relax.",Urban Development

I don't know how many of you people walk the streets of Royal Oak. I do almost every day when it's not raining or not too cold. Last Wednesday and Thursday I did my normal walks. It was about 1130. I walked down Washington Avenue and in the past Washington Avenue at 1130 is busy on Wednesday and Thursday. People want to go to lunch. Well  From the Peking House, the old Peking House down to 6th Street, total of 17 cars on Washington. 17 cars at lunch hour. This again goes back to those stupid meters that you have invested in that is driving people away. At the DDA last meeting, the city manager heard two  People who own businesses, Juan is losing $40,000 since those meters went in.  Another one who actually sits on the DDA will be leaving next year because she can't afford any more business, losing business in Washington. Number one, because of the parking, and number two, of all the things that are held, like Art Beats and Eat. Every one of you think it's a four-day event. It is not a four-day event. It is 10 days.  You start on Tuesday doing setup. That throws everybody out of that parking lot, P7, which is across from Royal Oak Manor. They have to park somewhere. Businesses start losing business immediately because nobody's coming downtown at night to visit the bars or to walk the streets or go to the stores. That lasts all the way till after Labor Day, at least Tuesday or Wednesday.  Those businesses, people won't be done. A lot of the kids that come down normally in the summer are back in school. Businesses are losing. I'm wondering if it's better to pay the penalty to get rid of these meters and the DDA has said that they will pay for putting in the old meters.  This has got to stop or you're going to be looking at 1970 like in downtown Royal Oak and Highland Park as a ghost town. This decision to put those stupid meters in is now having people lose their businesses, their livelihoods, whatever they worked for their whole lives is going down the tubes because you people are stuck in the rut to put stupid meters in  So Pete so these people can park and be safe.

I've been affiliated with a group calling ourselves ROAR, Royal Oakers for Accountability and Responsibility, for some years. I was among the founding members. It is truly nonpartisan. Members come together on city issues that are not affiliated with political parties. For example, the city's budget. ROAR members range from progressives such as myself to deep conservatives. We do not talk politics.  To demean Roar's voice, however, the Greater Royal Oak Democratic Club and Oakland County Democratic Party, of which apparently all commissioners and the mayor are members, dismiss Roar using the most base of logical fallacies, abusive argumentum ad hominem, specifically untrue, insulting, demeaning labels. It's a crappy strategy. While it does work, it really should not be used by elected officials.  Behaviors should be respectful to all residents. Among ROAR members are residents who have done years of community service and deserve respect. And ROAR itself has done community projects, specifically work on Barton Park South. After Commissioner Kim Gibbs died, ROAR raised funds to landscape the gazebo area in Barton Park South to memorialize her generosity and civic service.  I remain appalled that the City Commission censured her for exercising her constitutional rights to free speech and assembly. ROAR members have tended that gazebo for the past three years, watering, adding, and replacing plants, and thanks to ROAR's work, the City can now rent the gazebo for weddings. Here's the problem.  Annually, the DPS invites the community to adopt a park for a day. Once Roar beautified Barton Park South, we continued our long-term commitment to the city by participating in the 22 and 23 spring cleanups. The invitation flyer states, every group to sign up will receive a certificate signed by the mayor.  In May 22, I received a certificate with the line for the Mayor's signature blank. I called and was told it was missed probably because it stuck to another certificate. Okay, so I took the certificate to City Hall to be signed.  After two or three months, I pursued the issue and eventually received a certificate signed not by the mayor, but by Aaron Filipsky, director of the DPS. And this year's certificate is also from Aaron. My specific complaint is that even such minor matters as certificates of appreciation for community work are politicized in this city.  And to close, I'm going to move from this relatively small problem to an egregious example of civic misbehavior.

And I'm going to read what I wrote because it's easier for me. On Tuesday, May 16th, of the public master plan charrette meetings, I witnessed an assault and harassment during the public meeting.  The attack was intimidating and frightened many of the senior citizens who were there in attendance. The man who disrupted the meeting during the public comment section was overheard to say he had been invited to attend by the city as a special appointee. As such, his conduct as a special guest didn't reflect well on the city, nor did it foster the contribution of all the voices to the common good.  The week-long charrettes phase of master plan public engagement was not well publicized nor well attended due to the daytime scheduling which conflicted with many daytime work schedules. I myself had to take the whole week off and I did attend every session.  In addition, holding the meetings in a more accessible meeting place, such as a public school auditorium, would have been preferred over meeting at the center street parking garage. The cameras used to record the meetings as a public record should have been in good working order and should remain on during all public comment sections, even when it runs over.  In contrast, the camera didn't record the man's inappropriate abusive behavior as it had either been turned off or had been conveniently malfunctioned. Continued police presence at all essential meetings to protect, I'm sorry, to protect the vulnerable and to keep the peace. That should be number one safety.

After attending all but one of the Charette meetings, I was disappointed at the inconvenience of the time slots for the majority of the public. Parking spots at certain times were also a concern for some people. A comment was made at the final presentation by a former city employee along with some other citizens input. She and others stated,  I propose we have more meetings that are neighborhood specific. Similar to what was done in the prior master plan.  There were 11 meetings that focused on neighborhood involvement. These and the Planning Commission's Plan Steering Committee held its meetings at the Senior Center to facilitate citizen involvement. Public hearings were held at Baldwin Theater, OCC's Theater, and the Library Auditorium. Meetings were held after 7 p.m. when most people can attend and are not at work.  and they were held throughout the whole master plan process. This is critical to bringing the community along as recommendations are being considered.  Page 217 of the current master plan lists these meetings that were held 20 years ago for concrete examples. For the new master plan charrettes, unfortunately only one not eye-catching postcard was sent to me last January. Nothing else in my mailbox.  I find it ironic that I received and counted over 30 mailings for both parties, all election campaigning, but only one small postcard for something as important as our city's future, like a fair new master plan. So my conclusion is that the charrettes are not finished and need to be extended.  they should be called share ads. Share more with the public, with better times and places that will include all current and future citizens. Thank you. Thank you, Ms. Bobarsky.",Governance and Civic Engagement

And I just want to talk to you about the sidewalk, not the sidewalk, the bus stops, putting down the cement. I have like a huge easement, so it's not like your normal little patch on the other side of the sidewalk. My easement is probably greater than it is from me to you guys, like your wall back there.  I can't imagine a cement slab that you could put in that would actually make seniors be able to access it easier. Like especially if it's snowing or raining or doing whatever, unless you're taking literally my whole yard up with that cement slab, they're still going to have to go through grass and mud and snow to get there. Also,  Who's going to shovel that, be responsible for that, and things like that? I know it's not something that a lot of people have to worry about as much as we do, but when you live on a corner lot, I have about 16 pieces of sidewalk. So, going around the house, we already have a lot of shoveling to do on top of our driveway. Also, we did try to  make our driveway larger recently, and we were told we were not allowed to put any more cement on that side of the road. So it does seem kind of convenient that we could do it now. So that's a little disappointing in that. I would love to see the seniors be able to be more mobile. I'm 100% for the curb-to-curb service that SMART does provide. So I would love to see if we're able to take that money and  spend it more on the curb-to-curb services because seniors don't actually or those with disabilities don't need to be struggling to get anywhere. Definitely not whatever part of my grass you guys don't cover with cement. Our front yard has been torn up multiple times in a row. We live about 14 miles so we did that whole waterway project  And unfortunately, our front yard is the main source of all the new water pipes that you put in. So we already did for two and a half years of having our yard ripped up. And we've spent the last couple of years trying to make that grass green again. So it'd be kind of sad to see it go away.  I do HR and customer service, so I just want to thank you guys because I know how hard it is to sit and listen to people who really only come to you with complaints more than compliments.

The other thing I want to ask you about is at the last charrette  I attended. It was an hour discussion about Woodbird Avenue. Because of a sudden loud verbal outbreak, the meeting was closed before our time was up. Because of these circumstances, the meeting only lasted 40 minutes.  and very few of the attendees were able to discuss what they wanted to about Woodward Avenue. I live a block off of Woodward, and the suggestions for improvements for M1 in Royal Oak were not heard. I'm requesting another meeting  regarding Woodward to be set up for the master plan.

Patsy Regio, 1403 Smith Avenue, Royal Oak.  First of all, I brought this book up, Tell Your Children the Truth About Marijuana, Mental Illness, and Violence by Alex Berenson. When we were discussing it before it was voted on and they were put into the neighborhoods, I gave you a book. It was supposed to be sent to the library, and it wasn't. So I hope this book was not banned. OK. I ditto everything everybody talked about the marijuana.  And before I get into the marijuana thing again, I wanted to say, I know it's Pride Month. I respect that. But you should talk to the Board of Education. Because do you remember D-Day, June 6? Do you ever see a film of all the people running in the water, all the young people, younger than you, fighting for our country? They had the pride flag up, which is fine. But on D-Day? Why didn't they have the American flag on that and teach the students, this is D-Day.  This is why you have your freedom. That's why you're up there, I've told you many times. That was disrespectful to our country. One day, June 6th, to have that. Okay. As far as the marijuana thing, there was a mother in Texas. Her last name was Stack. She had a son named Tucker.  Called her parents and said, he was evidently away to college. He called his parents and said, I'm going to stop this. He became schizophrenic. Some people do on marijuana. He said, I love you guys so much. I'm going to stop using this marijuana. I love you so much, I'm going to stop. Hung up.  committed suicide and died. She is going for, she wants in the schools, starting at junior high, the kids to be educated about drugs. We should have that here in our city. We should have not just the therapy, the mental health, we gotta get it before. We have to teach junior high kids the dangers, the pros and cons, what it does to children, what it does to their families.

We're having a pot tent in our city that was voted down and brought back up again. It should not be happening here. We should not do it to the citizens of Royal Oak or any other city in America.

I'm here to speak about the agenda item number nine, which is Citizens Traffic Committee items, specifically 6I. And those are the crosswalks on Irving Avenue. I'd like to thank the Citizens Traffic Committee and the Engineering Department for the recommendation and endorsement of these two crosswalks last month. I think it will greatly enhance the walkability and safety along the Lawson Park western side. So I've provided you all with this printout that you can refer to later tonight when the agenda item comes up.  And the ask here is pretty simple. All I'm asking is the commission to consider the location of the northern most proposed crosswalk and to locate it as close to the private condominium drive as possible. Now the reason for this is this location will minimize the parking impact which is super important to Lawson Park. Mr. Fidelity knows that very well. It's one of our most popular parks.  And then additionally, we will not have to remove the tree that was planted in the right away that is currently right next to the Lawson Park sidewalk. Additionally, the Lawson Park East sidewalk will need to be remediated and likely will require heavy demolition, which is something that obviously we don't want to see on a brand new sidewalk that was poured last year.  And then the last concern is just if the crosswalk is kept in its current recommended location that was resolved last citizens traffic committee. I believe that'll create a pretty contentious situation from the crosswalk to the private drive with people trying to park there and ultimately.  you know impairing the ability of people to cross safely right there and obviously creating some attention to the Royal Oak Police Department which we do not want to waste their resources. The second ask I have related to this agenda topic item is that the commission consider enhancing the signage for these two crosswalks with  what I call signpost reflectors. These are used in our neighboring cities like Ferndale, Berkeley, and Madison Heights and they are affixed to signposts. They go from the ground to the sign itself. They mirror the reflectivity and the color of the signs so they're able to grab people's attention so they look up at the sign a lot more quickly than if it were just a normal green or gray signpost. So I think that'll be a great enhancement if that's able to be done on these sign installations.  I'm going to keep my time relatively short and hopefully when this agenda item comes up later tonight, you'll consider these alterations to the request.

I'm not trying to give a sob story, but just to give context to my situation. I'm a single parent. I lived in Livonia for a couple years.

I came before you to talk about my son very briefly and to talk about the different  reasons why I believe that we need a sign to keep him safe. In the city of Westland, when I requested it within two weeks, there was no problem. I didn't have to come to any meetings. They immediately put it up. So in case people in the room who don't know, autism is a complex developmental disorder that affects a child's cognitive and social communication abilities, which includes my son, Sebastian.  Children with autism often face challenges in everyday situations including navigating streets and crossing roads and for their safety it is essential to have an autistic child in the area sign. One of the reasons I was given is that the City of Royal Oak has never done one but they've done a blind child in the area and deaf child in the area so I don't know what makes this any different. Asking this for my son.  I believe that it's going to keep a mindful presence for my children when it comes to drivers, because we live right off the freeway and we have a lot of people who cut through who do not pay attention and they will run through the stop signs in my area. With autism being something that's so prevalent, it's one in 54 children. So chances are my child is not the only one in the area that could require one, but it's still an essential need to be able to keep him safe.  I do everything I can to keep my son safe, including keeping alarms on the doors. I have locks, multiple locks on my doors, but also it doesn't change that there is opportunity for things like accidents to happen. For people with autism, it's found that children with autism are 44 times percent more likely to encounter road accidents than their typical developing counterparts.  And based on a study from 2007, it cited that the third leading cause for five to nine... I'm sorry.",Public Safety and Law Enforcement

Tom Lenhardt, 1502 Maxwell, Royal Oak, Michigan, 48067. Good evening city commissioners, traffic committee members, and citizens of Royal Oak. I would like to comment on a topic on the agenda to be discussed later this evening. I want to thank the traffic committee members for not once, but twice, seeking the counsel of the citizens in the neighborhood.  In February and again in May, Maxwell Street residents came to this very room at a meeting called by the traffic committee and recommended logically and fiscally for at least two remedies to reduce the speed on our street.  Number one, we ask for random police presence in the morning and late afternoon when traffic on our street increases. We, the residents, have noticed this occurring with tickets being given to those exceeding the speed limit. The tickets send a message to the violating vehicle driver and to all of the other drivers on our street at the same time. Slow down.  We asked for a speed radar sign to be posted occasionally on our street and the police department responded to our request with favorable results. The speed on our street now reflects the speed limit. I would like to thank the police department for their assistance in reducing the speed on our street.  The residents would like to thank the traffic committee for implementing these suggestions and the Royal Police Department for their follow through. Vehicle speed on our street was an issue that has been resolved as a result of involving citizens in the neighborhood and the actions of our police department at no cost to the community. The residents ask that the city continue to implement the strategies that have worked. Random police presence in the morning and late afternoon,  and use of the speed radar sign to remind drivers of their vehicle speed. I think this is a definite win for both the city and the neighborhood and I'm glad to have had the opportunity to participate in a government of the people, by the people, for the people.

My name is Lucas Lesecki and I hail from Farmington Hills. To begin on a personal note, as a proud member of the LGBTQ plus community, I'd like to thank the Mayor Pro Tem for her wonderful declaration in recognition of Pride Month. I would have to say probably the best such recognition I've ever heard from a government agency. And as a student activist, I'd also like to thank the filmmakers who were in attendance and congratulate them on their win in the C-SPAN contest.  Now down to business, I'm here representing an independent transit accessibility study called Is the Metro Accessible? And on behalf of the group, I'd like to express our emphatic support for the proposal by the city to improve the accessibility infrastructure surrounding Royal Oak smart bus stops.  So many stops around the area, around the region are just sticks put in the dirt, which don't provide a sufficient accessible surface for many disabled riders, particularly those using wheelchairs and other mobility devices to access the buses. It's crucial that all stops have  concrete landing pads, which provide a safe and even surface for ramps to be deployed and for riders to access the buses in boarding and alighting. A lot of my colleagues weren't able to join us because of those lapses in accessibility, which reflect across the board, across the region, a lack of consideration for the needs of the disabled community in infrastructure, though,  We appreciate the plans to expand by the city, which represent what we hope is a continued commitment to the needs of the disabled community and continued investment in infrastructure and public transportation.  If you'd like more information about our project, our data is open to the public. But on that note, I'd like to thank the commission for their time and encourage them to vote yes on the adjustments proposed in the agenda. Thank you. Who's next?",Transportation and Mobility

My name is Trish Oliver. I am very concerned about the proposed amendments to the Recreational Marijuana Licensing Ordinance, that is agenda item 14 tonight. They would allow the commission to approve marijuana retail stores and grow facilities near students who attend any school within Royal Oak at its discretion. I am referring specifically to proposed amendment section 45C.  Every parent should be concerned about marijuana distribution occurring on properties right next to their child's school. Currently, Gatsby Cannabis at 5130 Myer Avenue is literally across the street from Oakland School's Technical Campus, which educates 9th and 12th graders in vocational trades.  In other words, it is a high school. As a parent, I am very concerned that the Mayor and City Commission grossly violated the city's and state's 1,000-foot rule by 912 feet, as Gatsby Cannabis is just 88 feet away from this high school.  The proposed amendment would legitimize the controversial approval of Gatsby's license along with allowing every student at any school to be exposed to a marijuana outlet at the committee's discretion. The complete rewrite of the new master plan and the zoning ordinance are designed to remove protections for schools, families and students and will complement the amendments to the marijuana licensing ordinance.  In a February 1st, 2022 Royal Oak Tribune article, when objecting to marijuana outlets being placed close to schools, Oakland School Superintendent Wanda Cook Robinson raised the specter of the harm that marijuana causes teens with regular use. She said the negative impact upon teens is undisputed. My concern is for every Royal Oak student at every school who would now be placed at risk.  In addition, relaxing the requirement for distance between marijuana stores could open the door for dozens of additional marijuana outlets within Royal Oak.  The commission should hold a public hearing before any significant ordinance amendment such as this is voted on because it affects every Royal Oak parent. Please recall that when you pass the original ordinance, hundreds of residents objected to various provisions in the ordinance at a public hearing. Many of the comments stress protection for students at our Royal Oak schools. Thank you.",Public Safety and Law Enforcement

I'm sure everybody read the article on your terrific parking situation. It was not a good article. You people have been derelict in your duty. This should have never been done. If you had done your due diligence, the city manager had done his due diligence and found out that the problems of other cities with the same thing, now they have gotten rid of it.  You are now hooked until what, 2027 with here? We will not have a downtown in Washington unless you do the final thing that the DDA recommended. Remove those parking meters and put the old style back in. They can change them. I started on key punch cards.  That's how far back I am. I wrote programs with less memory than the phones you have in your pocket. And we got worked around it. We wrote thousands of lines of code in small areas. It can be done. If they don't have the talent, then I tell them that's a breach of contract. Get the heck out.  Go back to your own meters. The DDA even said they would pay to put the old meters back in. Yet you people have done nothing. Yes, you increased it to three hours, 20 minutes for that. You increased the parking around the handicap and around the post office. But you haven't done the major thing to save the downtown area. Yes, it is dying. More businesses are leaving.  You may have some leaving this year. I know some that will be leaving next year. I walk these streets. How many have you walked the streets during the day in downtown Royal Oak? Probably none of you. Maybe on Saturday or Sunday, but I walk the streets of downtown Royal Oak and around the area every day unless it's raining. But I do that. I doubt any of you have done that.

We need one separate. Six years ago, I started asking for this to you, this commission, and the Parks and Rec Committee, that there should be a separate commission. We've got a senior tsunami coming in. We've got a plan now. We need a board just like the  environmental advisory board. We need a board to run that plan and get some things implemented on behalf of seniors. Sarah Kindinger, who's the chair of the senior task force and Parks and Rec gave you a great foundation for it, for what could be written in the ordinance.  I would recommend having as many people on that board as there are on the environmental activities board because you want to break up into groups and work on it, but that's, you know, up to you guys. But I want to see it tonight. I want you to pass, not wait for another committee, another commission, another information gathering. I would like you to see you tonight direct the city to write that ordinance and bring it back to the next meeting so we can start working on this. We haven't done, we haven't,  We passed the plan, the task force was sent down and really there's been some work done on it, but we need a board to run it and advise the city. So that's number one.  Number two is the bus paths. Unlike the gentleman who was here who already spoke, I am not in favor of those. They are on the list of activities for the plan. But we have, according to SMART, there's very little usership of these sites. There's only two that actually have what I would think would be  would merit having them, and there's nobody assigned to clean them off in the winter. So how safe are they going to be if there's snow and ice and that kind of thing? These are ARPA funds. I would like to see the ARPA funds used for benches and accessibility in the parks. That benefits not only seniors and it's part of their plan, but it benefits the entire community.  So that's what I would like to see. Also, regarding ARPA, at the last meeting, how much time do I have? At the last meeting, special meeting, we paid GuideHouse $317,000 to advise us on ARPA funds. And suddenly we needed a special meeting over something that was happening in Washington, D.C. that I knew about in April as a possibility. So where was the ball dropped?  was it Guide House or where was it? You should not have to have had a special meeting to make that vote on Monday, last Monday. And I'd also like to see an update  on the ARPA funds. You had a meeting that said, where do you wanna use it? And there was a lot of feedback on it. If I look at the CIP, there's no money that's actually allocated in there. I'd like to see the city as part of transparency say, where are we now with the money? What have we spent? What's left?

First off, I'd like to do the fact that we were talking about the arts and the young ladies who were finalists in their art competition. I'd like to recognize my daughter, Robin Tenegas, for being a finalist in the College of Insulting Living Oceans Foundation International Art Competition.  She placed as a finalist the top 13 out of about 1,200 kids from around the world from the ages of 11 to 14. She was on the Royal Oak Schools page. I know, it's embarrassing. She's here working on an AmeriBadge right now because she's working towards her Eagle Scout as well. Other thing I would like to bring to attention is one of the biggest issues we have around Northwood School, where most of my kids go,  is the congestion on McDonald and the fact of how we get the people through this commuter school every morning. One of the biggest issues that I've seen, I walk there every day, I've been walking there every day for  I hope the laws count, probably 10 years at least. The crosswalk that's in the parking lot really is a hindrance to keeping that flow moving through the parking lot. Everybody has to come through to pick their kids up if they drive. They come through, pull up next to the school, and then there's the crosswalk where all the kids and everybody walk to get to their cars or walk back into the neighborhoods where they live.  If that crosswalk were moved to the other side of the parking lot to allow them to cross there, then there wouldn't be quite the stop, go, stop, go of everybody trying to get across this one funnel point where everybody else comes in. Would help ease the congestion in some of these problems that I know the residents on McDonald absolutely hate. That's why I don't drive my kids to school. That's why I've walked for 10 years,  I don't like it. I have friends that have been had their cars hit multiple times, everything like that. So would be something to look into. I've spoken with the PTA with the principal and they were going to go to the Board of Education, but I don't know how far that's ever gone.

And as you know, I had been following this marijuana thing for a long time. I had FOIA'd the information about the selection of the facilities and it came back severely redacted.  So my comments tonight about your proposed ordinance changes are the percent complete of each of the three approved marijuana facilities should be discussed as part of the consideration for the proposed ordinance changes. The proposed amendments to the marijuana ordinance will allow a second six-month extension provided the building permit is not expired and they actively engage in construction.  or the improvements are complete but the state license has not been received, the request for a second extension will be valid for one year from the effective date of the state license. If the construction is complete and they have a state license, why do they need a one-year extension for an entire year? I don't understand it. Maybe I'm misunderstanding what you're asking.  Anyway, the distance between a marijuana establishment from any school, existing retailer, or micro-business previously limited to a thousand feet will now be at the discretion of you folks.  This looks like a CYOA for allowing the Gatsby facility to be located within 88 feet of the Oakland School's technical campus by claiming that it is not a school. Ridiculous. The school representatives originally objected  to the facility, but their objectives were quietly silenced. I've often wondered who put the pressure on them. Note that a Grower A, the fourth selected facility, not yet approved by the commission, is also located adjacent to the technical campus.  Allowing a marijuana facility closer than 1,000 feet from any school is grossly irresponsible and shows little or no regard for student welfare. Allowing marijuana facilities to be located less than 1,000 feet from each other is just inviting an adverse impact on adjacent neighborhoods.  Makes me wonder what is next, the approval of more facilities? Paul Brake in an interview with Fox 2 Detroit said, are we going to open up the floodgates? I kind of doubt it. I think we're going to do this incrementally. I guess my time's up. Thanks.",Governance and Civic Engagement

Regarding the second reading of the marijuana ordinance,  The distance between a marijuana establishment from any school, existing retailer, or micro-business previously limited to 1,000 feet will now be at the discretion of the commission. The ordinance change sets a dangerous precedent for the location of future marijuana facilities that will be approved at the direction of this or future commissions.  Allowing marijuana facilities to be located less than 1,000 feet from each other is just inviting an adverse impact on adjacent neighborhoods. The 1,000 foot buffer from the K-12 school also protects the entire downtown area from having a marijuana facility. As a downtown property owner,  I do not want pot dispensaries downtown in addition to the bars. I suspect that the initial intent of the ordinance change is that it will allow a marijuana sales and smoking tent for Arts Beats and Eats. ABE is only a one-week event that does not occur when, excuse me, when school is in session.  It seems that the ordinance could be amended to allow a thousand foot buffer to be compromised for a temporary event that occurs only when school is not in session. However, the ordinance states that no consumption of marijuana shall take place on the premises of a marijuana establishment.  I don't know how you're going to do this marijuana tent and have sales and consumption. Additionally, does the House of Dank have a license for a marijuana facility in Royal Oak? The ordinance provisions regarding license transferability pertain only to Royal Oak licenses.  Two of the paragraphs state no municipal license issued under the ordinance is transferable to any other location except for the municipality licensed premises on the municipality licensed property and second  a municipal license holder may not engage in any other marijuana establishment in the municipality licensed property or its name or any other location within the city without first obtaining a separate municipal license.

Specifically, proposed amendments section 45C. Previously, those superintendents sent emailed notices to parents to notify them to attend city commission meetings on this controversial subject.  The scheduling of this issue on the agenda after schools have been let out for the summer appears to be a tactic to avoid input from superintendents or parents whose children attend Royal Oak schools and who will be negatively affected by this amendment.

Hesitate to say that I'm disappointed that even those of you who have experienced fatal drug abuse in their families would vote for the marijuana sales and use at the Arts Beats and Eats family-oriented event.

The city attorney stated that the zoning ordinance would allow marijuana facilities to be located less than 1,000 feet apart  contrary to the marijuana ordinance. However, the zoning ordinance conflict resolution states the most stringent of the requirements shall prevail. The master plan draft summary  says, overall, Royal Oak doesn't need significant change. Rather, it needs a lot of little changes over time that will be transformative altogether. This is an understatement. The document is replete with references to rezoning and changing from traditional zoning to form-based zoning.

I first want to say thank you to the city, other small businesses in Royal Oak, and the community at large, supporting my family and Rae's Ice Cream for the last year as we become the new owners. This last year has been a whirlwind of ups and downs and hard work and exhaustion. But Rae's has now hit a major obstacle that I've come here today to ask for your help to really ensure the survival of our neighborhood institution.  We are, of course, a destination ice cream parlor on Coolidge between Normandy and 14 Mile Road that relies on people to navigate Coolidge to get to our business. We have very small walkable traffic from the neighborhood. DT Energy is about to begin a two-month project during the busiest time of year for our family business. Without any notice, DT Energy is about to shut down Coolidge at 14 Mile while Normandy Road is still under construction between Crooks and Coolidge.  DT Energy has not given Ray's Ice Cream, Leprechaun Field,  or a number of other homes and businesses, any notice. I'm being told that this project was approved by the city back in January of this year. And DT Energy has waited till six months later to start the project. So the urgency doesn't seem to really be there from DT Energy's edge. I would ask that this city council and the mayor today pass a resolution to put an injunction on this work till after the Dream Cruise or at least the construction of Normandy has been closed.  If this is not possible, at the very least, I ask the City Council and the Mayorship to change the detour that the City of Royal Oak is currently posting. That detour from 14 Mile goes from 14 Mile to Crooks, Crooks all the way down to 13 Mile, 13 Mile to Coolidge to get to my store, because a very small little work is happening on Coolidge just by 14 Mile Road.  We're a destinational standpoint. Customers are not going to drive all that way to get to us. At the very least, can we change that detour so it goes from 14 Mile to Delmare Road to Normandy? This way be much shorter, probably about a third of the distance to allow our customers to visit our parlor during the busiest time of the year.  I'm just worried about what the health of the business will be because there's an expectation that when we're open all year round during the winter time when we're not getting too much traffic that we can really make  a significant amount of money to cover being open for the rest of the year. I really ask your help again today in doing what you can to pass a resolution to help us and stop DT Energy and its contractors by giving no notice to the neighborhood to create construction that creates a big headache for everyone, including my business, Baltimore Lanes, Leprechaun Field, the Royal Oak Golf Center.

And I want to be able to have a way to make funding available for things that we should do.  can't necessarily get people to vote on a millage to do.

But after working an extra day from a hospital, I drove my street and I felt like I was in a war zone. It was like an arsenal, competing arsenals. And one neighbor in particular, it went on for hours.  And I just feel like that exceeded whatever decibel level there must be. Because my cat died, I have a new kitten. It was screaming by the time I got in the house. My outside pet was gone. And the fear knocked down a barrier. I usually bring her in before it gets dark. And it was only 9.

I've looked and looked for my pet and can't find my pet.  Anyway, in putting my flyers up on the telephone poles in the following days, a woman saw me putting them up, and she said, I'm so angry. I wish somebody would go to the city commission. And I said, what's wrong? She said, my mother was dying, and she died two days ago. So I was putting those up on Friday. Her mother died on the 5th.

I think before some of these were illegal. And now they're legal. Because I remember people going to Ohio or other states. Is there anything that we can follow? Because it rattles my nerves.  You know, that's so loud. And I know it's just for this holiday, but we have a beautiful city fireworks. We have a parade. We have other ways to celebrate. And it seems like, okay, that goes on for an hour when we have city fireworks. Could people somehow be contained in the city to do this for one hour? Four, five hours straight? I mean, is this the way we're going to celebrate Independence Day in the city? It's just...  rattling old people when they're dying and people losing pets. It just seems like there's a better way.

I visited with the former city planner when that was being constructed, and he was so excited about building that and being one of the first in the area. So anyways, I wish he was here to see 50 years later what's going on. OK. Regarding tonight's agenda, Janice Wagman.  Regarding tonight's agenda, the animal shelter, again I'm going to say I don't think it should be sundown, especially with what's going on right now. It's no reflection on the manager.  on Jodi's job, it's just that the purpose of the committee is to act in an advisory capacity. And right now, with everything that's going on at the shelter, I think now's the time to keep it going, at least until we're in the new building. I know she wants to do some new things there. We should still be advising. And I'm very sad that the Senior Advisory Committee is gonna be the last one that's brought before you. It's been six years I've been asking to have that.  Charlene Douglas has done a wonderful job with the senior task force. We've got a plan and nothing's happening with it. It's just been sitting out there. A few things done by the city manager's office, but you need a committee to drive it. And so we need to get that going, especially since 23% of our population is seniors. So,  A few months ago, I went to the charter review meeting because I was looking at the meeting minutes and there was nothing. Nothing was happening on reviewing the charter. And what was mentioned was that they had asked the city manager's office on several occasions to supply them with anything that he felt was necessary that should be looked at and he didn't. And now with our agendas, I think they're pretty anemic in the past three at least.  There's hardly anything on it. So I'm going to give you a few suggestions like I did with them.  With the ordinances, tonight you're looking at the LED ordinances. I would suggest, I did a little thing on Facebook about adding signs when you have any variance requests, any public hearings in the zoning, planning, or here, that will go out in front of the property just to alert people there's going to be a public hearing. And overwhelmingly, there were people who didn't want it, but overwhelmingly people were in favor of it. So I would look at that ordinance. The ethics ordinance.  You don't follow it so either change it or follow it. There's only two people on this commission that have bothered to fill out the ethics form which basically says what property do you own? What businesses do you own that would be in Royal Oak or affect Royal Oak? Also you can look at handicapped parking in the downtown which was recommended by your own authority. That's kind of fallen off the table. I haven't heard anything about that.  But a big one is the ARPA status. Where do we stand with that? What kind of money have we spent? What do we have left? What do we still have plans to spend money on? Is there any other things out on the table that we're thinking about doing? The public should know about that. That's $28 million.  And lastly, I had some other stuff, but I'm running out of time. Lastly, I think when a member of the community who's given so much has passed away that they should be acknowledged, male or female, should be acknowledged in the agendas. We lost Mayor Pecky Lewis and John Winland, both big contributors to this city, and their passing should have been acknowledged at our meeting. Thank you.

A potpourri of comments, and then based on what I just heard about this proposed parking structure, I have a lot to say. First of all, Paroosh Park. Renaming the park in recognition of Pat is definitely appropriate.  Pat and Dave are friends and former Woodward side subdivision neighbors. You may not always agree with Pat, but she is always prepared. On the Hamer Park, will the improvements include a traditional historical marker that tells their story? This is what I proposed almost two years ago that got this ball rolling.  And I'm getting shakes of heads forward. Okay. It's the story that's important. All right. The MPS parking. I have a question as to what the data analysis shows due to the increase in grace period and maximum stay for April through June.  Basically, why don't we just cut through it and eliminate the back in parking on Washington and provide conventional or civic smart meters as are used in Birmingham. Now, this $600,000 check for parking deck is a drop in the bucket for first of all. Can you tell me where you're going to put this parking structure?  The reason I ask is the master plan is proposing building on the 6th and Main Street lot. That lot is important because there's a lot of people that won't park in a parking deck and that lot is consistently loaded. When I was on the DDA I was responsible for obtaining that property from Frisard. It was their bump shop.  so I feel a little bit paternalistic toward it. As far as another parking deck is concerned, we don't need it. The existing parking decks are underutilized. My understanding is that you're having problems paying the debt service on the parking decks and why are we building another parking deck? It doesn't make a damn bit of sense.  Now, I've got 21 seconds left, that's why I said I'm throwing this away. But I wish you'd tell me where are you going to put another parking deck? I don't think, I can't think of another empty space in Royal Oak where you would put it. Blank looks? Nothing?",Transportation and Mobility

First of all the terms of standing is great but it's still not going to do the job. Those back in parking are keeping people away. Most people can't bar back into parking lot if cars are on both sides.  You can program them just like you do P7 lot, which is across from Royal Manor and right next to 536, that bar over there in the corner in Buffalo Wild Wings. Those are all kiosks. You put your darn license plate number in, boom, it's taken care of. Simple as that. On the streets, if the people go in head first, put the license plate number in, So all you got to do is if they head in parking, have them put their license plate number. When they back out, it's done. And this other thing on number 15, rank choice voting.  I kind of did a little research and I got the pros and cons. The pros, it determines the candidate with the strongest support wins. It encouraged civil campaigning. That means you people will have to go to everybody in the city road and not your favorite little clique groups.  reduce wasted votes, and need for multiple elections. The cons, too complicated. You expect senior citizens and people to figure out how to do rank choice voting. It's expensive. Two, the person with the most votes may not win.  If you check it closely, people with the second or third place may have more votes than the first place votes because you didn't get 50%. Your vote may not count, it'll be exhausted. In other words, if a 5% got your vote, your vote is thrown out automatically. So anybody that votes for that person, they didn't count. It delays the results.  The results will be, hey, two, three days. And it violates our constitutional right of one person, one vote. Of all the states, 50 states, 30 states don't have it. 12 states have it for only local elections, and those are the far left.  Six for military and overseas. One bans it all together, which is Florida. 30 states don't have it. Seems to me that most of this country does not like rank voting. So I think you people will be making a bad choice.

I was doing comedy out in Vegas in a house sitting for an adult actress. What I came today to talk about is safety. And I hate feeling that I need to be calling the police all the time from just living downtown. The number of smaller crimes I see committed, but as we all know, the multitude  it creates a dangerous situation. I've had multiple situations where either me or my friends when in a crosswalk would have a car come right up to us like within millimeters. Just even on the way here walking here I saw a very aggressive driver who was making a left turn and seeing that I was making the the cross just went ahead anyways and gunned it through.  And so I've been noticing a lot of this activity. I know that resources to police it are limited, so I don't hold law enforcement responsible in any way. I know they do what they can.  I think we might want to look at some measures to kind of do some more remote policing. For example, sometimes I park in the garage at 6th and Lafayette and sometimes I see things in there that aren't necessarily going to rise to the level of a police response or an arrest but it's just kind of just unlawful activity. For example, a couple weeks ago I was driving south on Lafayette trying to get to the garage  There was a car with its hazards on, a whole bunch of people milling around it and I was like waiting there and they're telling me to go around and my issue is I've been burned lately by some reckless drivers and I want to be careful. I don't just want to go out into that middle lane that's there for a turn when somebody else expects  to be able to use that lane. So it seems maybe kind of common sense that you just go around, but I didn't want to. I'm like, I'll wait for you guys. I'll wait for you guys. And they got frustrated with me. And those are the kind of situations I'm constantly finding myself in downtown. Also, I know the bullet's in the chamber, but arts beats and eats. I love it. I love it. I love it. I love it. I want to stay in Royal Oak, but  I think we need to deemphasize carnival rides as one of the types of attractions at the thing. I'm a marijuana user and I think we should have no such marijuana advertising whatsoever in that district. It's not for kids. And kids are there. And it just doesn't need to be there.

Commissioners, my name is Chris Ott. I live at 1305 Ann Drive in Royal Oak. I'm here tonight to, I'm the petitioner for a citizens traffic committee item 6B and 6C, which come up tonight on item 11.  So on your printouts that you'll get in a second, you're going to see a map on the first page and a couple notes you can refer to on the later pages and pictures when this item comes up.  The ask that I have for you all tonight is pretty simple. For item 6B, we'd like to add signpost reflectors to the seven stop signs on or bordering the former truck route to increase awareness and visibility of these stop signs, all of which are but a crosswalk, so we think it'll improve pedestrian safety and help drivers see these signs at night.  I personally think the signpost reflectors are great. As you can see on the second page, it's a relatively simple way to let drivers know and draw their attention to the traffic sign at hand. The signpost reflector carries the same color of the sign down the post. So again, it just makes it easier to see.  So again, those examples are also included on that second page, and then the requested stop signs are also shown there on the latter pages. So it is noted that three of those stop signs are actually about 20 years old, so I was hoping Engineer Donahue was here tonight so we'd get a laugh about that, because those are always kind of goofy. So hopefully those can get replaced as well.  I'll keep my comments relatively brief. Again, just asking the commission to consider amending item 6B tonight with those seven stop signs under consideration to add those signpost reflectors to those and to accept the staff recommendation on item 6C. Thank you very much for your time. And I appreciate the sentiments about the former commissioner. I didn't get the chance to meet her or know her, but I was looking forward to  being a part of that journey of discovering who she was.

She's lived in Royal Oak for 12 years. She told me recently that she, instead of an $85.50 water bill, and I have copies of those from December and March,  She had a visit from one of the DPW people, which is to his credit, because he came out before she got the last bill, because it was so high. Instead of 85.50, it was going to be $2,073.85. He came out to warn her of this high bill, and she asked him to look at the meters. He said the meter in the basement was not moving.  And so she had no time before the bill came out to get any repairs done because she didn't expect this bill to be that high. She has since then had two of us friends read the meter because she can't make it down the basement steps. And instead of 155 hectocubic feet,  It's only been two hecto cubic feet in the last 43 days. So there is definitely a problem somewhere. One of the things she saw on next door is someone said that they saw construction people making use of a resident's outdoor faucet and there was construction on her street.  And so that may be where some of that water came and went from. She heard no signs in her house that there was any kind of leak or water usage.

I know they've been mentioned before, but you said about your friend Pat, who I'm very sorry you lost, that she had a sense of welcomeness. And I believe that's what Mark has done to the Memorial Park. He has brought the community from everywhere together, and I just hope that we can look at these upgrades and make it even better.

I would like the following statements and photos entered into public record. First photo shows the dump contamination at the southwest corners of Ferris Avenue and 1018 Genesee.  The second and third photos show the proper cement washout station to contain cement during the washout, thereby preventing hazardous material from entering the environment.  On 8-21-2023, the City of Royal Oak was present during the pouring of the cement at 1105 Genesee Avenue at the northeast corner of Ferris and Genesee. There is evidence left behind a cement contractor had discharged, cleaned and dumped hazardous cement byproducts upon the dirt portion of Ferris Avenue. Obviously, there was no concern for the environment or the citizens of Royal Oak. Apparently, this had been done under the presence of the on-site supervisor for the City of Royal Oak.  There was no effort made by the contractor or the city of Royal Oak supervisor to follow any type of contained procedure. This gross negligence resulted in endangering the environment and to the residents of Royal Oak. The dump site located at the southwest corner of Ferris and 1018 Genesee Avenue was not more than estimated 20 feet from a Royal Oak drain.  This is the second violation, the first violation happened on July 25th, same location, which resulted in the physical insult by the employee who was employed by the city of Roanoke. This action resulted in physical contact being made by the employee against a local resident. The dumping of cement on 821 at 1018 Genesee Avenue was followed by heavy rain on 823, 2023 through 824, 2023.  The site location used by the cement company to clean their equipment is approximately 20 feet from the storm drain. I was hoping for the past emails to be sent to the Roanoke city manager and the engineering department would correct this and would result in a more favorable outcome. Please review the 2012 and the 2023 Roanoke master plans, referring to sustainability and protecting the environment.  Please refer to an article by the Royal Oak Tribune concerning the city of Royal Oak, Michigan by Mike Connolly from Royal Oak Tribune on May 14th, 2023 at 6.05 AM. In reference to that article, city manager Paul Blake said, Royal Oak's policies are dedicated to practicing the combat climate and changes and protecting the environment. This is really getting out of hand. Thank you very much.",Environment and Sustainability

My name is Jacqueline Mullich and I live off Coolidge in Normandy and I'm here to speak on behalf of the Leprechaun Upgrades. I'm able to walk to the Leprechauns games and it's become a tradition to take my kids and my dad to several games each season.  It's been so special to make these memories with my family. 40 years ago my dad played softball at Memorial Park. Enjoying the games is nostalgic for him and he's of course impressed with how the field's improved so far. A few upgrades to the field would make our experience that much better. The bathroom facility needs to be renovated. Improvements can be made to make it easier to take the kids to the bathroom.  Viewing from the stands is tricky due to the fencing and the angles of the bleachers. Climbing into the stands and the tight space between rows made it difficult for my dad and I to comfortably sit for the game. Going to the Leprechauns games and Memorial Park in general is a huge part of my family's summer and upgrades made to the field would benefit the community and the athletes. Thank you.

Just before I started, I didn't know if you guys knew, if you all knew what the country that has the fastest growing capital in the world is Ireland. It's Dublin every day.  As you might guess, I'm here to talk about the Leprechaun team. Mark Sack had already talked to you about the new program that hopefully they're going to have there. I have been coming to the games the last three years, off and on. I do happen to wear this. I love to lead cheers. I could lead you some cheers now, but I guess I'll wait for later.  But what's fun about that program there, if you haven't been there, the ticket takers, the management, the concession people, the greeters, Mr. Sackett, everybody is very, very friendly and open. It's a very unique program. I myself have been an umpire for 46 years. I've never seen a program like this. I think you guys got something going for you. I bring friends of mine from Troy. I think you need to improve that program and you will really go a long way.  The seating needs improvement, more comfortable for old guys like me. Getting some handicapped seating would be good. Getting rid of the bleachers. I mean, you've had the program for a while, and it's successful. You've had the facilities there. It's been good. You need to upgrade. Difficult to see through the fencing sometimes, the scoreboard. There needs to be a warning track out in the fields. As an umpire, I know that warning tracks can provide safety for outfielders.  You could have a bad situation if somebody doesn't have a warning track going back to catch a fly ball. So the bathrooms also need to be improved. You just need to upgrade there. You've got a new program, new facility, new program, new league coming in. Upgrade your facility, upgrade, and then we'll make it a new league, you make it a first class, something you can be proud of. Go Leprechauns.",Parks and Recreation

Item 11, we're looking for more safety features on the former truck route.  So my two neighbors are up here already. At the same time we're promoting walkability, the drivers are getting terrible. Since 2019, traffic deaths up 50%, bicycle fatalities up 26%, pedestrian fatalities up 18%, alcohol related fatalities up 22%. Michigan just passed the distracted driving on June 30th.  We've got a lot of speeders on this truck route. We had an engineer at Donahue put out a report. So as Chief Moore knows, speeders are more likely to be intoxicated, more aggressive, and they practice poor driving habits. They're more likely to. So at the same time,  traffic's getting worse, drivers are getting worse. We as a city, with our master plan, with where we're going, with our progressive principles, we're promoting more walking, jogging, bicycling, walking, strolling. And our area has a lot of great investment, and a lot of more folks, a lot of kids, and multifamily, and the great park, of course.  What we need is the modernization of the old truck route. So, almost nothing has been happening, or nothing has really physically changed with that route since I've been living there for 34 years. So, we need to improve pedestrian safety, we need to calm the traffic, and we need more signage, more awareness.  for entering a residential area, combined single-family, multifamily, with a flood freeway system that has loads and unloads on a road like Mohawk. So it's been a problem for years. So what we're doing now is we're trying to get calming and traffic safety for that piece. So that piece  is the truck route in the yellow. We're looking, as Chris and Sue talked about, we're looking for crosswalks with signage at these two locations, entering the residential area from where the dispensary is going to be, and then entering and leaving where the freeway is through a residential area. And quickly, here's a little mock-up, but I've been studying crosswalks, often a worn-out  then they disappear off in snow covered. So what we have some of these but you wouldn't know it. So what we're asking for is to do something like this to give us the fluorescent and the big science and really slow down the folks. So that's item number 11. Thank you.",Transportation and Mobility

First time I met her was at Jim Reznor's house at a party. I was standing with her and Jim Ellison, and I remember sharing a joke about, there was an issue about having a bar within 500 feet of a church or a school, and I said, huh, I don't want churches or schools within 500 feet of a bar.  Okay, right off the top, all Royal Oak residents should have free admission to Art Speeds and Eats. I strongly feel that way. I don't think they'd be giving up that much revenue by allowing that and I think it's fair for  residents as far as loss of use and the effective traffic it has on other people trying to get to work. It screws up rideshare demand, makes it expensive for people to get to work. Also, I don't really like the marijuana stuff either, even though I support its legalization. We have Hazel Park for that. Yeah, there's this guy, Tom Hayden.  He was born here in 1939, December 11th, and he went on to do a lot of amazing stuff. He went to Shrine Elementary School, attended Shrine Church, went to Dondero.  where he serves as editor of the paper in his outgoing address. He used the first letter of every paragraph to spell, go to hell. He was denied his graduation ceremony, but received a diploma anyway. He went on to serve as editor of the Michigan Daily, and then covered race issues for the National Student Press, where he was beaten by white mobs in Mississippi.  I see you have the open carry issues part of your closed session, and I'm not that guy. Don't worry. I don't want to be that guy. But I think it's stupid that I have to wear a wristband. I do. I think I should just be able to show my ID. And furthermore, I don't want any festival security impeding my route to my home under any condition. I don't want them touching me, laying their hands on me.  I'd like to see the city prosecutor prosecute accordingly if that were to happen. If we want to put the power of law behind me just walking into where I live, then there should be police officers stationed at every entrance and exit to the festival for that very purpose.  And yeah, I could have been like, no, I'm not wearing it. Or, you know, screw you. And I think about what would Tom do? Well, Tom would have probably turned the whole thing into a 1968 Democratic Convention. So I'm not going to do that. But I know what at least Tom would have done is come up here and say something about it. So that's what I'm doing. I think it's unnecessary. I think it's an annoyance. I love Arts Beats and Eats. I got the sweatshirt at the very first Arts Beats and Eats that was in Royal Oak.  And in the past few years, I've noticed it changed negatively. Thank you.",Urban Development

As many of you may or may not know, I'm very vocal in letting you guys know what I think, and I've done that with Pat in the past. And I just wanted to share one thing about my many emails to her. She, when we were trying to prevent the paving of parking spots in Delamere, she emailed me back and said, Mr. McGee, you're absolutely right.  And I love that email because she pointed out all these facts about Delamere and how it was once green and then it was paved and now go back to green. And so I appreciate that. She was very kind and always took the time to email me even when we disagreed. So very nice. But what I'm up here to talk to you guys about tonight traffic committee item 1160. There's no turn on red sign currently going from southbound Delamere on to  westbound Normandy. I'd like that sign to be removed. This goes against what the traffic committee is recommending with you guys. My reasons for this is about a year ago you guys approved traffic calming as well as some other traffic mitigation stuff on Normandy to help lower the speed. And two, it's fitting with tonight's agenda topics,  the environmental impact of removing this is pretty high. So in my professional job, I do a lot with fuel economy. And one of those things is you burn a lot of fuel just sitting around doing nothing. So if we can prevent that by getting the cars to turn right without having to sit at a light,  It's better for the environment. It's about half as much CO2 reduction as you would get without that sign. So the key is get rid of that sign. Reduce your CO2. Reduce your formaldehyde. Reduce your hydrocarbons. It's great for the environment. There's really no reason to have it there. There's no traffic, or excuse me, there's no pedestrian, there's no crosswalk there. So it's a win-win for everybody.

Mark Sackett, General Manager of Royal Oak Leprechauns. Appreciate you taking the time and condolences also for Commissioner Paroosh. I think I read a quote about her saying business over residence and she never chose business over residence or residence over business. She was about the community.  So I thought that was a good segue for what we're doing at Memorial Park as a nonprofit corporation and trying to bring people here and share and build for the community. Real quick recap of our leprechaun season. We started off with bringing in high school teams from country day to Oxford, which was a great first game that where country day won on a walk-off double.  And then Birmingham Grows and Birmingham Seaholm played at Memorial Park. And that was a 2-1 rain to shorten game, but it was a great, great fight there. We saw Rochester College bring in U of M, Dearborn, Cornerstone University, Cleary University, and even Concordia University.  So the field, the park, it's really getting noticed. It's filling up. I would think that Mr. Vidali will tell you that the numbers of these rentals are going crazy over there, which is great to see. The field is great. Our leprechaun season allowed us to squeeze in 26 home games from early June to late July.  This year we opened the park to allow the ROSL to play during our games in one of the other, the youth fields. And that seemed to work pretty well, allowing them to play more games there as well. Overall, our attendance and our sales were up this season. Our kids club grew. Our name became more recognizable in the community.  Our first three games of the year, we had a ton of elementary kids there. We had over 1,500 kids show up in three days, and that park was packed, and those kids were screaming, and the teachers loved it, because they weren't in their classroom with them. So it was a great kickoff to our season. It was great seeing all these kids, and they're all wearing their leprechaun shirts, the Royal Oak leprechaun shirts, which was great.  Last week we met with the president and founder of a higher level league. It's called the Northwoods League. That league is a higher level league. It's a step below minor league baseball.  They really liked what we are doing at Memorial Park. The Northwoods League has games on ESPN Plus and ESPNU. They bring kids in from all over the country. The Northwoods League is a league that hosts the Traverse City Pit Spitters, what we're most familiar with. Kalamazoo Growlers, Battle Creek, Battle Cats. So that's the league we're looking to jump into. If we did that, we'd have 36 home games. Again, we'd be bringing a lot more activity to that park.  So we're hoping to do that. It would be amazing for the leprechauns. It would be amazing for this community to see some real over with there. The only thing that's holding us back is our facilities. And we just need to try to get some improvements, some facilities, and some people are gonna be talking about that. Thank you, I appreciate your time.",Parks and Recreation

The backstop being a chain link instead of the standard net that a lot of these leagues and other teams have, it's hard to see through. It doesn't matter where you're sitting.

Yeah well thank you to the commission for the opportunity to speak and condolences I'll throw that for Commissioner Paroosh who took many really important votes on the environment here at the commission and I think was not only a friend to current Royal Oakers but friend to the environment and to future generations as well and just want to recognize that. I also want to recognize that I was just out west I just got back and  Climate's been on my mind a lot recently. Out there, drought is really important. And so some of the ecosystems we see, they're so fragile. 1% of the surface area is actually wetland in places like Colorado, but 40% of the species rely on those wetlands. So when we talk about drought, we see a really delicate balance in our ecosystems. And I think there's a narrative we tell ourselves about Michigan that  we're special, you know, when it comes to climate change, we're gonna have it better than some folks, because we have water, because we have maybe a more moderate temperature than other places. But the reality is, when I was coming home, we were hit with two really powerful and intense storms, and right where my parents live in Livingston County, actually, there was a tornado. We believe there was actually another one, or at least some kind of rotation that knocked out a bunch of trees that wasn't  documented because there was a lot of damage directly in their neighborhood, trees on houses, cars were smashed in, and they were in the basement, you know, huddling, because there's this giant storm around, my retired parents, and, you know, I was getting off a flight where I was stuck at the airport because half of our airport had been closed, and all the flights had been rerouted to the other terminals, so there was not enough transportation services to get everyone off site. So I saw climate change out there, and I saw climate change  here affecting my family and our communities. And it really drove home for me how important this moment is and how in many ways we're just in the opening act. Even if we turned the switch on emissions today, there's a lag. It would take a generation for us to restore the balance in nature. So I just wanna emphasize the bills that are happening today are going on right now in the legislature. It's a once in a generation opportunity for us to take action. This is not gonna come along again.  like this. So I appreciate the attention of the commission to this issue. I appreciate all the work that's been done on the sustainability plan. We are a leading city in many ways when it comes to this and I've enjoyed being on the board and working with a lot of the commission and the volunteers there.

So of the seven Senate bills, our Senator Stephanie Chang was a co-sponsor of all seven. So I wanted to acknowledge that.  There are three in particular that I'm going to focus on that I think will most benefit the City of Royal Oak and its sustainability plan. And that's the requiring utilities to have a renewable energy portfolio that has 60% renewable energy by 2030.  2030 and 100% by 2035 in order to meet those greenhouse gas reduction goals. This is absolutely essential that our utilities step up and meet these requirements. Also, another bill addresses energy efficiency that requires our utilities to achieve a 2% or electric utilities achieve at least a 2% annual  Electric energy efficiency requirements. So this is the program that you know, there's rebates and there's things, you know, they have to work with the community. We need this kind of support with going forward and this this mandates this in this.  in one of the bills. And then the last is develop a statewide plan to reduce emissions from heating homes and businesses. I mean, I think this is gonna be the toughest challenge for us as a society. I mean, it would be one thing to produce our electricity from renewable sources, but looking forward, we all heat our houses and buildings with natural gas, and this is gonna be a huge, I mean, I've heard estimates statewide, we're talking 57,  billion dollars.

So good evening, Amanda Herzog, chair of the Environmental Advisory Board, 306 Rhode Island Avenue. As you are aware, on tonight's agenda is a resolution in support of Michigan House and Senate environmental bills adopting the  That's on there. The Environmental Advisory Board is advising the Commission to consider adopting the resolution because the state initiatives align with the goals established by the City Commission to achieve 40% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and achieve net zero by 2050. They also align with the actions outlined in the Sustainability and Climate Action Plan.  and I'm joined here tonight by my board colleagues, Paul Vial and Andrew Sopolis. They have been working closely and vetting out these bills and they can speak to them more specifically. I'm here though to speak on a more personal note. So when I moved to Royal Oak after graduate school, a power outage to me meant drinking the beer in my refrigerator with my husband in the backyard.  When I became a working mom, power outage had me terrified about losing the stock of frozen breast milk in the freezer, risking the flexibility in feeding my children. And now with my children older, I'm concerned for my senior parents and their medications that must remain refrigerated.  There are many more social impacts of power outages that Royal Oakers face. Food insecurities, medical devices, mental health issues, etc. And we in Royal Oak are experiencing frequent power outages. Just last week, Royal Oakers were impacted by the round of storms that happened.  And the frequency and duration of these outages have many concerns. So it's important to invest in resilient systems. So for Royal Oak, safety, public health, and meeting the city's environmental goals depend on it. And these bills will put us on the pathway to a greener, more sustainable future. I just want to make one note, Commissioner Pat Paroosh was an inspiration, and I just want to thank you all for sharing your memories of her.",Utilities

We just need a little help to take it up to the next level, the next notch and, you know, come to the lucky corner, have some fun with us and play some baseball. Thank you.",Parks and Recreation

I had just a 682 East Garfield Hazel Park. I'm here to show support for the leprechauns. I'm a former baseball player myself and going to the games over the past three years for this team have been wonderful. Then some of the highlights of my summer brings back memory memories. I even played there at the field 2030 years ago. Um?  and it makes more memories every day. I've even housed some of the players and coaches. So some of the improvements that need to be done on the field, I mean, there's been some improvements that have been over the years, but you need a better fence. The new barriers are a lot more efficient, safer for players. No warning track makes it difficult for players to fully  play the game that they need to play. They're worried about their safety, running into the fence, getting hurt. Just makes it more smooth. Everything else that's done has been nice, but there should be some more improvements to help better the field, better the game of the baseball. Thank you. Thank you.",Parks and Recreation

My address 17488 Dunblane Avenue, Beverly Hills. I'm here on behalf of the Royal Oak Leprechauns as well.  So as a resident of Beverly Hills, I often get to frequent the Leprechaun Games at the Lucky Corner. Hopefully all of you have also. I am proud to say that I have known Mr. Mark Sackett for many years. He has not only been a mentor, coach, and friend to my son, but we as a family have grown to love him and watch him grow this organization. My son Griffin truly has fallen in love with the game of baseball.  To me, there's really not a better gift to give a family than a close, friendly, and affordable night out with everyone together. And wow, we have it. We have it right here at the Lucky Corner. It's just miles from all of our homes. Well, Memorial Park really is a gift for all of us. To hear that the Leprechauns have been asked to join a new league is an incredible outcome. It's very positive. There's been a lot of individuals who have dedicated hours of sleepless nights to see this success so far.  So ladies and gentlemen, here of the council, I ask you to please just sit back and think for a moment when a sports touched you and gave you a smile from ear to ear. We've all witnessed the incredible acts of achievement from athletes of all kinds. And I'll be honest, the last few weeks, I don't know if you watched it, but I've enjoyed watching the Little League World Series. Did you see El Segundo California win? It was an incredible highlight. Maybe you should go back and take a look at it.  From the combination of the kids' perseverance and the tough love the coaches have given them, I just really wish that series was not over, but it is. We know that we've got more baseball to watch, we've got MLB, and we've got the lucky corner just around the block.  One thing I'd like to know is this evening, do you think we can just sit back and think baseball's really back? It's back, baby. Now, council, can we please get on board? We need you to support this endeavor. It's a whole new chapter for all of us. We will continue to grow our own piece of history within Memorial Park.  Thank you for your time. And I just am honored to hear all these things you talked about about Pat. I didn't know her, but I knew her a little bit by reading the board outside. That was a nice dedication.

My name is Teresa Mullen and I am the owner of The Fern here in Royal Oak, 406 East 4th Street. I am a new small business here. We just celebrated one year, August, this past August, so we made the first year mark. There's no going back from here, but I wanted to show up today.  and just let you guys know that I still have no employees, and that is my own fault. I'm very controlling over my business, and I blame that probably on my mother, so. I'm here for two reasons today. One is to thank the city commission for the ARPA funding for Arts, Beats, and Eats. As a small business, that really helps us out when it comes to marketing materials and extra costs, so I deeply appreciate that.  And I also wanted to share my input on what an amazing weekend I had at Arts Beats & Eats as a small business. This was our second year at Arts Beats & Eats. Not only did the city support us, but Arts Beats & Eats provided us with a discounted booth space due to the firm being a small business.  I'm not going to be specific on what our bottom line was, but the results were very positive and had a very nice impact on my small business as we head into the winter months. It definitely helps me out and I'm going to be hiring someone soon.  But it was also a chance to promote my location since we are on the end of East 4th Street over here. We're kind of hidden and kind of in like a little nook there, but if you haven't been, I encourage you to because we have a really nice patio and some really good drinks too.  So my family supported me on the labor side, and I had a lot of friends and support of our regular customers that come in when it came to this event. And while it was kind of hot the last couple days of Arts Beats & Eats,  I found it incredibly beneficial to my small business. I was able to meet a lot of new people, a lot of new customers that I then saw the following week, and they are now regulars now, believe it or not. So I've heard a ton of feedback from my friends and customers, and I'm glad that there's a festival like this that my small business can participate in.  Events like Arts Beats and Eats and Royal Oak Taco Fest are great for promoting and bringing people to downtown but it also again directly had a profound positive impact on my business and I just wanted to share that with you today. So thank you for the ARPA funding and thank you for allowing a positive festival to come into the city. I know that some may disagree but as a small business owner who  literally has my mom work for me for free. It definitely helps us, and I would like to share some positive light to that. So, thank you.",Economic Development

As a quick recap, I'm the owner of Best Life. I submitted Best Life's application in January of 2021. Best Life was officially awarded its license from the city in June 2022. After completing all city, state, CRA inspections, Best Life has officially now opened.  Back in 2019, Michigan Cannabis Regulatory Agency, CRA, created the Adult Use Microbusiness License to allow only in-state residents the opportunity to own and operate fully integrated small business in their local community. As we all know, since 2019 and 2021, a lot has changed in this world, for us and especially business owners. The general cost of living, wages, materials, you name it, almost the cost of everything has risen, except cannabis due to the saturation of the market currently.  At the beginning of 2023, the CR made several revisions to the rules, licenses, and license fees to keep up with the times and ensure that as this new market continues to mature and continue to provide an exceptional amount of state tax revenue, that no one was left behind or at a disadvantage. Currently, Best Life is allowed to cultivate 150 cannabis plants, process cannabis goods, and sell our cannabis goods. We are not allowed to bring in any other cannabis goods from any other company.  This was the original micro-business license that the CRA created back in 2019. One of the rule changes the CRA made was with the micro-business license. The state has offered the micro-business licensee the opportunity to choose which micro-business best suits their business needs. They sell the original micro-business license and have added the option to convert an existing micro-business license into a micro-business Class A.  A Class A microbusiness license allows the licensee to cultivate up to 300 cannabis plants. It does not allow the licensee to process the cannabis. Those 300 cannabis plants would only be packaged as flower. The licensee is also able to bring in processed goods from other processors in Michigan. Best Life is requesting that the City of Royal Oak take into consideration the transition of Best Life Cannabis microbusiness into a Class A microbusiness.  multiple micro-businesses across the state who chose to make the transition are already operational as Class A micro-businesses. The reason for this transition into a Class A micro-business license is to create more jobs in our community. We project that Best Life would be able to generate twice as many jobs if we were operating as a Class A. We would also be able to have higher pay for our employees as this would generate more management positions.  The Class A license will allow a broader selection of products for our customers and allow us to have more specific medicinal cannabis products that we would not be able to produce as a standard microbusiness. The Class A license will allow Best Life more opportunities to become more active in our community with local events and charities.  With this short time allowance, there are many major benefits in regards to how Class A is better fit for Best Life Cannabis, and I hope the City of Royal Oak can see these benefits for both sides and all of its community members. Thank you.",Economic Development

Really appreciated that. Regarding the number nine on the agenda about sending a postcard out with a URL and a QR code, I'm strongly opposed to this. And the reason being seniors and low income individuals.  I don't know where this idea came from. SIREN, we're paying SIREN $150,000 a year to maximize communication efforts, including on topics like taxes. So I'm wondering if they approved this, if they thought this was a good idea, or if it was the city manager's office when the city manager has presented the aging in place plan, which specifically states that one in three Oakland County seniors is digitally illiterate, and people still prefer low tech options.  SEMCOG says that 7.4% of Royal Oak households, not just seniors, do not have an internet subscription. So why should they be made to jump through hoops to get the same information that everybody else does? Not to mention many times when people get postcards, they think they're advertising and they just toss them out. They don't bother to read them. So what is the purpose? Why switch to this? Is it to save money? I can think lots of ways to save money, and this should not be one of them.  To the Commission, how does this satisfy your strategic goal of equity and inclusion? Frankly, I'd like to say I'm surprised by this proposal, but I'm not. Given the failure to provide more on-street parking, handicap parking in the downtown, forcing people to park in parking structures that were constructed without ADA doors, prioritizing sundowning a committee over creating a new one to implement the Aging in Place Plan, completed nine months ago,  I'm not surprised that once again, seniors and in this case, lower income households are being marginalized. I urge the city commission to vote no on this proposal. Stay with the regular plan of sending out a letter to every voter. How much time do I have? All right, I'm on social media a lot and I regularly get  Messages from other people that I don't even know that bring up issues that they've encountered in the city So someone wrote me and said I saw home. This is regarding fugitive dust. I Saw a home being demolished two weeks ago nearby my home and they didn't even have water available The warning sign that is supposed to remain on the fence was no longer posted The workers pointed to the hose on the real launch to the neighbor when I questions a required wedding. I  Over the course of three days, I had to go back numerous times only to find them doing active demolition with the water turned off. I had to call city enforcement twice. After the contractors were approached by the city, they went right back to turning the water off or using the water but not having it reach the actual demolition.  The city of Birmingham put into place safeguards independent of the state and federal laws. She's reporting that it's no safer now than it was before. So if you're not aware, this is also going on in the city. Thank you.",Homelessness

I'm not sure where Pat stood with the Leprechauns. I know she loved the city. I'm sure she loved the city. I love what I'm doing in the city and at Memorial Park and hopefully  this love for the city and everything is going to continue carrying on. At the previous commission meeting I was pleasantly surprised of the many people both from Memorial Oak and surrounding communities to support what we're doing at Memorial Park. Since the last meeting I spent three days in Minnesota meeting with the leadership from the new league we are looking to join. We learned a lot and we realized we need really need to work on upgrading Memorial Park.  I have a proposal I'm going to share with John Fidelity and Aaron Filipsky that is broken into two areas. Some major capital improvement type things and some smaller improvements that our program will work to cover the cost and leave no burden on the city. All of our improvements are to benefit this park for the city and will bring more people to see and experience Royal Oak. I believe this is a good thing. I also believe that our proposed improvements will continue to grow the game for the youth of Royal Oak.  who will then grow into being proud descendants of the local ROSL program. With this potential new league affiliation, I've received a phone call from another one of my former players who played at University of Michigan.  even though I'm a Spartan grad, I'll say that. And he also played in the Miners for a few years. He wants to get involved. I've also received some support from two other very prominent businesspersons, one who's very involved with the Detroit Lions of all things, but he's a former baseball player that I coached when I was at Birmingham Groves. These two people love what we're doing. They love the area. They just see a lot of great potential for it. They want to get involved.  So I'm meeting with John Daly on Wednesday at the park, and I hope to pass our proposal on to you in the weeks to come. We're a nonprofit organization. My books are open. You'll see that my salary's lower than the ones what you're making right here at being a commissioner. There's basically no salary. I do it for the love of it.

And the reason I said is for a couple of reasons. I think we need to  Put an absolute cap on the spread of Arts Beats and Eats any further for the time being outside of its current zone. Second, I think we need to refocus it more towards art.  I feel like the art we've been getting now is kind of box truck art. People go around the shows. It'd be cooler to see more avant-garde stuff from local artists featuring artists, minority artists, women artists, local artists, have it more focused on things like that.  I know the downtown dollars for some retailers, that's been helping any revenue that's offset by the festival. But I know for a lot of other retailers and businesses, they're taking a pretty hard hit. And I'm hoping there's some way we can make it more equitable for those businesses that are severely affected. For example, the salon on 6th, I overheard maybe 30K that weekend.  Make it more equitable, possibly put the booths in the middle so that the storefronts are more accessible and visible. I know there might be a logistical concern there regarding electricity, but you're talking about strategic.  Aging in place, sustainability and climate action plans, which is good because I intend on aging in place here and I would like to see recycling made available, more available to residents in the downtown core.

Okay, homeowners buy homes for location and privacy and is likely their main investment. How do you think they would feel when one day the word gets to them that they are likely to have a major change in their lives? The fact here is that the subject is not zoned for this plan.  A few years ago, a builder wanted to get a variance to build two homes on our block. It was about 10 years ago, actually. The board considered the wishes of the residents that attended the meeting and decided in our favor.  One, two, three, it's done. Why is this so difficult? This system requires only four votes, I could be wrong, you can correct me, to decide on the lives of the residents. Although getting seven votes here is not usually a problem.  Over the last few years, we have been told that these and other changes will not affect our values. That was an insult, similar to saying the world is flat. Now we have another. Parking won't be a problem because only one person will be occupying the unit.  What is the point of having zoning if it is only to approve variances to please those who have enough money and feel entitled to harm a neighborhood, whether it's for new construction, additions, or other uses? Unfortunately, this is not the only area of the city that has experienced or plan to have detrimental changes, not only the residents, but the whole city will be affected. Thank you.",Housing

They do this all the time with the DDA and I'd like to see something similar here as part of their contract.  And speaking of transparency, in our charter, there's lots of ordinances. Many of them are outdated. They need to be looked at. We're going through reorganizing the list so it's easy to access different items on there. But one that's in there that shouldn't be.  excluded and I think is very important is the ethics ordinance. And in the ethics ordinance, it says that you are required as members of the city commission to fill out a form like this that states what property interests you have, what business interests you have, what interest family members may have, that it's 10% or more.  And I think that's very important as far as transparency to the residents and the people who elected you. Only one of you has filled that out and it's on file in the city manager's office.

Here's the consensus that I see going in Royal Oak. We have the Genesee project  We have the Phillips Project. We have the Greenfield Project. We have the East Harrison Project.

After everybody leaves, we're the ones that are usually holding the bill  Residents, when they want a variance for their private property, a lot of times they get a lot of no's and it's not allowed. It seems that when developers want a variance that a lot of leeway is given to them even though they know it's wrong and even though the residents are against it.  Here's the problem, OK? I'm a strong union guy. I've been in many labor negotiations. When you give variances to one developer, they have a tendency to look at each other and say, hey, you did it for them. You did it for them. You did it for them. Totally against the Greenfield project. I got passed on with no recommendation. And that should tell you automatically that it should be dead.  Another thing is, and like one of the other residents talked about, if you're taking money, whatever your interest is, from a developer for an election campaign, it should be brought to the attention of the public and you should accuse yourself on voting on it. That's the way it should be. I mean, come on guys, it's basic math.",Urban Development

They manipulate you if you stay, shun you if you leave, peer pressure. What's dangerous about this? People need respect with difference of views, ethnic backgrounds, skin color, lifestyles, gender preference, age, economic status, etc.  Sometimes in government, local and national, we see good teams suddenly go bad. Like when a 4-3 vote for a developer's bad project oddly becomes 7-0 for the pro-developer and is still a bad project. How do you guide adults to help the individual and common good  when they have been tarnished by bad decisions or bad behavior and swayed to go with the click they know are wrong and unethical? How do you stop this cycle? You ask the adults to look deep inside and think how they hurt someone by their actions, just like you ask a child, maybe an apology, certainly always telling the truth. You teach that child to be honest and admit their mistakes. Why am I discussing this?  I believe our city government needs to move forward in many ways, but most of all we need to move with care and thoughtfulness. Back when people could trust each other, choose quality of life over bigger, flashier buildings and homes, taking care of what we already have versus being greedy and wanting more and more while harming the environment.  Treating our neighbors' hardships like family and not letting big development ruin anyone's life. People first, not money first. Let's get rid of the government clicks now by listening and bringing in more voices. You might find out that those other voices always wanted what was best, but they weren't listened to because they weren't in the click. Just like in high school.  Special thanks to Jimmy Carter, Democrat, who founded Habitat for Humanity. Wasn't it a click?  Abe Lincoln, Republican, helped abolish slavery. Wasn't it a click? And I know this sounds weird, but Kermit the Frog, It's Not Easy Being Green Party, who helps our greatest hope for the future, our children, building their self-esteem, spreading kindness, so that maybe we won't have any more dangerous clicks. And as far as the 13 and Greenfield Project and the six trees on site,  A true arborist tries to save diseased trees to make them healthy and trim healthy trees that could be dangerous. Some developers cut down healthy trees because they are dangerous to their pockets. Thank you. Thank you.",Governance and Civic Engagement

I'm here about item number 11, the redevelopment of the Greenfield project. It was brought forth as a PUD. It should never have been a PUD. The zoning allows for three units. They first presented 12 units and backed off to 10. That's  Negotiating 101, you show them death and they'll accept pain. What's really disturbing to me is the fact that the Planning Commission, it took three votes to get it to this point. First they wanted to deny it, and Planning Commissioners Fournier and Douglas were against that.  and then they wanted to pass for it, and again, Forney and Douglas were the ones that voted for it, which caused them to go to a third vote, which pushed it to the city commission. The problem is, you've heard tirelessly how you folks have accepted money from the representative of this,  and his firm, and then others that he's represented. And it's just getting tiring to see all these decisions that are made to benefit those who benefit you. And it's almost, it's just reminiscent of the Biden crime family. It's sad. I know you enjoy it.  So anyway, the other thing is the parking structure on Washington. Why has the  Washington entrance been closed for I don't know, two, three weeks and the sign directing people to go to Center Street. Are you folks really trying to shut down business on Washington so that they go out of business and you can redevelop Washington like you've done Main Street?

I took a little walk over the weekend and I wanted to see what downtown looked like. I wanted to see what people had to say on the Northwood sector right there where you guys are doing the bump outs and the road narrowing.  None of the people I spoke with liked it. They don't even know why it's going on but stated that trying to cut down speeders. Gotta tell you Royal Oak doesn't really have many speeders. If anything they're catatonic sitting behind the wheel sitting at a green light. That's what I'm seeing. I don't see speeders. Either way this project is going to cost an arm and a leg based upon what I'm seeing here and  We could be putting this towards the roads that need repair, utility that needs repair. Monica had made mention to it during the forum. You know, putting efforts towards the roads, surface of the roads, repaving. These roads are cut horribly, cracked. I mean, the cars are falling apart. I mean, I'm seeing it. So the cost of this  I'm just curious. I'm dying to know how much this would cost just along this Northwood sector. Because the people that are living upon those roads, or that road, not good. Beyond that, I took a walk through downtown Royal Oak as well. And this is really going to, this is messed up. The people that I, the business owners that I did speak with, they're not renewing their leases in another year or two. Twelve to be exact.  up along Washington, up along Maine. And it's due in part to the parking meters. Granted, there's a lot of parking structures. Sure, they can park there. But here's the thing. The folks are putting money in the meter. They're paying the meter and they're still getting cited. Now, MPS, Municipal Parking Systems out of Minnesota,  has a great review rating online. They're not just doing this here in Royal Oak, they're doing this throughout the entire country in cities just like Royal Oak. And that in itself is concerning. I mean, there could have been some things done. I know there was a no-bid contract that was voted on back in what, 2012, 2013?  put you guys in a bit of a pinch. I don't think, I don't want to believe that you guys would have signed up for this knowing that this is where it was gonna end up going. I truly believe that you guys mean well but at the end of the day here we are and the downtown area is getting more and more desolate and in the next year to two to come I can't believe I'm gonna be actually seeing something as bad as where it's heading.

The perfect circle back today came when I was walking and I saw a train going through town is on my way to Royal Oak Masala, which is a great place you should go to. And I saw probably about a dozen, I don't know if they were empty or full, tanks of fuel going through our town. And I think that underscores the reason why we need to, even though it is,  expensive embrace electronic availability to electric vehicle charging now. None of the handicapped spaces in the garages have access to electric vehicle charging. That's an accessibility issue.  And that definitely is, I don't think it's acceptable, personally. I think the, you know, I don't really like the new parking system. I do hope you guys would have the will to change vendors. But that said, we still have these posts everywhere that have electricity running to them. And if those could be somehow modified into chargers that deliver a light charge to vehicles,  while they were in town could make the street parking look even more attractive. Aging in place, about that, please keep in mind that people who are younger and intend to age in place like myself, and my specific concern is that  Too much of downtown would be bought up by people who seek to sell condos to somebody who has no interest in ownership. And just because I have no ownership interest doesn't mean I don't care about this city. I care about this city very much. It just means it's not a wise financial decision for me.

It's now you're building all these apartments and condos and all that. What you're building is transient apartments. People, when your parents were here, they bought a house, put grass and trees and flowers out there. They were planned to stay there 25, 30 years. What you're building are people that are going to be here five, six years and say goodbye after that.  Why don't you, instead of building all these cement and concrete and all this stuff, and then you're going to put solar panels in that we have to buy from, we send our material over to China, China puts it in there and makes solar panels.  Why don't you just put houses with families, single families, with grass and trees, so people can stay here 10, 20, 30 years, instead of staying here, oh, five years and move on and that's it. Because that is what's happening here. You're not building family homes. You are building transient homes for people to stay five to 10 years and then move on.

What I want to talk about tonight is the two meetings that you had on December 30th and the special meeting that you called on December 20th. On December 13th, you guys had a proposal in front of you. I believe it was from Segway. And you were discussing that. That was for the warming shelter. And you were discussing that.  And that was starting to gain a little traction. So I was watching the meeting. I was thinking, you know, somebody is going to call for a motion to vote on this, OK? And that's when Mr. Mahoney, who did not like the idea, says, whoa, whoa, whoa. He says, this bid is over $50,000, which it was, and we need to bid this out, OK? So you guys called a special meeting. You discussed it. There was a lot of discussion about whether it needed to be bidded or not. Just about everybody commented.  You voted to call a special meeting and allow all the players to come to the table and bid on this warming package, okay? So now we fast forward to the December 20th special meeting. Before you guys discussed the...  Homeless Package, which was the reason for the meeting, Mr. Forgrave made a motion that he wanted to buy $155,000 worth of pallet houses. Ms. Brunel seconded that motion. That motion passed four to three. Brunel, Forgrave, Mahoney, and Dancy voted for that. So my question is to you folks, the four of you that voted for that,  What happened to the $50,000 rule? Mr. Mahoney, you were rather adamant about that. You spoke. You spent two or three minutes talking, saying, we need to bid this out. We're a government entity. We have to follow our own rules. Ms. Brunel, you spent a special amount of time on that, too. You were telling everybody that you were a real rule follower.  drove your colleagues and your friends insane, you were such a rule follower. You also said that we can't be a government entity that doesn't follow their own rules. Mr. Forgave, you also had some comments on that. So my question to you guys is, I mean, aren't you embarrassed or aren't you concerned about the people that vote for you or the constituents? I mean, what do you tell them when they call up? So I got a suggestion for you.  Tonight, instead of councilman comments, you guys have an unlimited amount of time. Instead of standing behind echoing somebody else's comments or not making no comments, do some damage control. Tell us, maybe you simply hit the wrong button. Maybe you made a mistake. Do something. Comment. Give some type of comment on why you did that, because that's horrible behavior. Just when you think the bar is set low,  it gets set a little lower. So please, help yourselves out.

Turns out Jill Biden had classified documents taken to an unsecured office from his last, from his time as vice president. None of his residents or offices has had armed raids on them though. The enemy, the mainstream media is pushing rationalization that this situation is different from that of president Trump situation.  Well, it is that President Trump had the supreme authority to declassify documents and then Vice President Biden did not. Not to mention President Trump's documents were more secure. The Gestapo has nothing on the Biden administration's Department of Justice and FBI.  Regarding homelessness here in the city, the city council in the last meeting decided to urinate away hundreds of thousands of dollars by buying prefabricated shelters from a company looking to make a buck. The prudent thing to do if doing a panic virtual signaling move  could be considered prudent would have been to take advantage of Jackson Public Schools willing to work with and help the city with a lease offer that was mentioned here last meeting. It would have at least allowed the city to get an idea of how many people actually would need the services of a city shelter.  Instead, the city council decided if they build Daniel Mahoneyville, people will come even if it takes certain codes. Then there is in the hundreds of thousands amount of money going to residents in action to push for equity. One might think they didn't have much of a track record for such an important task.  But as I had explained to this council by email, they have a poor track record. What is essentially their CEO who gave the presentation and couldn't answer so many questions and took credit for resources that really didn't belong to their organization.  what essentially is their COO, his lifelong criminal history of theft-related pleas, although she pushes the narrative now it was for dealing crack and she was only doing it for her kids. I mentioned this group and its predecessor, his consistent history of misuse of funds is beyond disgusting.  this council voted to work residents and action the bid.

I'm here to talk again about ethnogenics, psychoactive plants such as magic mushrooms.  And I'm asking that the city look at decriminalizing it, take targets off of people's backs, or at least the thought that they may have a target on their back if they should so seek psychedelics for personal therapy.  Since Colorado, Oregon, and a lot of municipalities and states around the country have legalized or are in the process for 2003. There are 11 states with bills currently going forward. Michigan had a bill last year to decriminalize, to legalize it. And it was a bipartisan.  I don't know who. I forgot who the Republican was that co-sponsored it with Jeff Erwin out of the Senate. In Michigan so far, Washtenaw County has decriminalized it. Wayne County has decriminalized it, as has Hazel Park.  Everywhere it has gone forward in front of the city council, city councils have voted unanimously for it, to decriminalize it. In the county of Jackson, there has been no arrests for it.  So there wouldn't be any prosecutorial problems associated with the city officially decriming it. I don't think our prosecutor would have a problem with that. It has been in the news a lot lately for, well, recent study helps with excessive drinking.  depression, PTSD. At the federal level, bipartisan lawmakers have introduced a psychedelic caucus in Congress, and it's moving forward. Everybody is talking about it.  The FDA has just approved a large study that was in August. They approved that for alcohol reduction therapy. So we have a lot of those problems here in Jackson. And because of the news, the people are looking into it and wondering about it.

And I'm here to talk about an act that started back about 60 years ago. The city of Jackson started a discriminatory act against certain homeowners. Those homeowners are the ones that own sidewalks. Not everybody in the Jackson City owns sidewalks.  They stopped putting in sidewalks about 60 years ago. And they haven't put them in since. I have 200 lineal feet of sidewalk I have to maintain every year. I'm disabled. When they came along in 2008, redid East North Street, I had to move my sidewalk in six feet away from the road to stop the snow plows from burying my sidewalk. Little did I know, it didn't work.  Because nobody parks there, they come along about 40, 45 miles an hour and bury my sidewalk every single time. I look across the street, they have no sidewalks. In 1971, they built Northeast Junior High. There are no sidewalks going to that school. Along Floral Street, they have it on one side, not on the side where the school is. They have the youth home, no sidewalks.  Certain areas, there's 30 feet, no sidewalks. One block, no sidewalks. They built my core, no sidewalks. They say they have no money, but we can build a six feet wide, so many mile long sidewalk in one part of the city. But the city that pays the taxes and supports the city for all the years before there was a sidewalk there when it was a train run through there,  can't get sidewalks. Every year I have to shovel and maintain my sidewalks. Every year I look across the street where no sidewalks are. That's discrimination. You're forcing liability onto me from people across the street, having to come over to my yard or my sidewalk. My, I say that not my, to walk on that. Now if I walk down North street going or east, that's what street walking north.  When I get to McGuire street, I cross the street, I walk into people's yards. If you come from Ellen road coming south, the sidewalk ends at the road. You have to walk across to people's private driveways in order to maintain your traverse. That's discrimination against that driveway, forcing the liability onto those people because the city can't continue the sidewalk to the right of McGuire street.  so that you can keep going. It's time to end this practice of discriminating against people with sidewalks. Thank you for your time.",Urban Development

Um, I want to honor the work that the, um, art commission did. Um, I also want to say that the final sculpture that's being proposed here tonight, I think it's ugly, but I mean, I didn't go and I didn't comment and I wasn't part of the process, but it's not something that I personally would choose.  I want to speak about Keisha Hamilton's comments. I want to talk real quickly about whiteness and blackness. In the ancient world, there was no color prejudice. I don't know if you know that, but like the Greeks thought in opposites, white and black, light and dark, night and day, but they didn't assign a moral quality to either concept.  And the Greeks also had their black Athena. You know, she was a goddess of the city of Athens. They had their sister states in Egypt. And in case you don't know, all the fair goddess of upper Egypt were black. So the Mediterranean was a community that did not have color prejudice. Color prejudice was invented by a man named Barnabas. He was contemporary as Saint Paul.  And he was the first person to say, he was a Christian, he was a proselytizer like St. Paul, and he went out and said, the devil is the black one. Black skin is a sign of sin. Blackness is evil.  And this was the origin of color prejudice. St. Augustine accepted those things, and later on, Pope Nicholas V issued a bold, dumb diversus that allowed the Portuguese to enslave the Moors, heathens, and other enemies of Christ.  And they were found in Guinea, in Africa. And that started the African slave trade. So to say something is evil is dangerous. And I communicated an email, and that's Keisha and Slick. And I suggested that she use the words evil is predainage. Or, and I superiored an email. And that's, or white ignorance, but not whiteness. Because will is predain something evil. And I, you're heading up. When that's happened to black people.  And I don't think we want to do that. Thank you. And it was the Christians who did it.",Governance and Civic Engagement

I was up here at the last meeting, I think it was on January 10th, and I was referencing the last two meetings you had of last year, December 13th and December 20th. In my comments last week, or at the meeting, the last meeting, I referenced them several times, and one of the times, I inadvertently meant to say December 13th and said December 30th, so I don't know if that caused any confusion. I think everybody  I knew where I was coming from on that meeting, so if that caused any confusion amongst all of you, I apologize for that. We'll go back to the meeting that I was talking about, and I had a little concern that you guys purchased some pallet houses without sending it out for bid. I didn't really think that was right. I asked the four votes that voted for it if they could possibly comment on that and tell the people where that vote came from.  There was only one of the people made a comment. That was Ms. Brunell. Now, she had an answer, a comment at the end of the meeting. Or, I'm sorry, before the end of the meeting. She commented first, okay? It got around to the mayor who was going to speak, and he deferred it to Jonathan or the city attorney. Mr. Green had a good point. He said due to the purchasing policy, sole sourcing, and there were some other circumstances, scarcity of resources, emergent need,  It was in his opinion that it was okay for counsel to do that. He mentioned a memo. Now, I never saw the memo. I don't know whether that memo was privy to the public or not.  there was a little concern. Something still stinks right there because if he sent the memo out, I have no idea when the memo was sent out. It could have been sent out when we originally talked about pallet houses. It could have sent out, he wasn't at the meeting that you guys voted that at. It could have been sent out before that meeting. It could have been sent out after you guys made the vote. So in everybody's comment, nobody mentioned the memo. So I don't,  I don't really know how it is. It's like, did anybody get the memo? That seems strange to me.

And this is about the roundabout artwork, which I see as an opportunity. Those behind this art are probably smart, nice people doing their job. And aren't we glad a portion of construction must go toward art?  But time and time again it feels imposed, having little participation from the neighbors who live with it. Roundabout often is being treated like guardrails and light poles, and I might add it's starting to look like it too.  But we needed an opportunity to be better than that. I studied urban planning at UCLA in California several years, and the number one lesson to avoid being a soulless government was simply to include the people.  This community was shown four abstract sculptures chosen by who knows who, using an artist who came from the community, no, was a friend of someone, and who knows why those four won out. They were presented, and a short call for input was given, and the community was told which abstract thing would be installed. And no one likes this.  I'm sure a sculpture being placed in a roundabout has limitations. A variety of meetings in different venues could have explained that, even as it links to what the community is like.  There may be reasons why representational art should stand in a place people could get close enough to, to appreciate it. And wouldn't it be nice if the city worked with the neighborhood to make an installation, maybe at the MLK Center, but without community again, we have an abstraction that doesn't relate to the community, that doesn't really work with the community and that manages to alienate the community. So why not, who doesn't,  and listen to input in a variety of venues, and get that up close sculpture underway, even as the roundabout work is imagined, maybe created by local artists, something more relatable that the community helped shape.

I'm here tonight as a member of the Martin Luther King Community Corridor Improvement Authority. And because of my membership on that body, I was asked to participate in discussions and meetings regarding public art at the roundabout that's been put at the MLK and Morrell. I'm a big fan of public art. I think public art adds vibrancy to a community.  And so, you know, placing public art in a roundabout or anywhere else to me is, seems like a good idea. Um, this process that we undertook, it wasn't some short overnight process. We started meeting in July of last year to go over some, some of, some of the ways that we might be able to get some public art on the south side of the city. After a bunch of meetings and interviews with artists, we put out proposals, the artists sent back their proposals. It was like 15 or 16 of them.  as a committee, we just went through the process and, using our own scruples, decided which ones we might want to present to the public. So we went through this whole process to present it to the public. There was email feedback on this process. There was also a public meeting over at the King Center where the artists were actually in the room  People from the public could come and interview the artists, look at some of the artwork that they've done. And so there was plenty opportunity for public input. As usual in this city, there's a lot of talk after the fact. And everybody says, I didn't know this, and I didn't know that. Well, it was well publicized. The work was hard. I thought that the committee did a good job. We enjoyed our time.  and we think that we came up with something that's representative of the South side of Jackson and something that the members of the South side community will like and appreciate. One of the things that bothers me about this whole process now is that something different is happening. It's good because we're going to end up with a couple of pieces of artwork that's going to be installed in a couple of different places. My main concern is the public input on the from the original work that we did. The public input said  We voted for this guy. We want his art to go at MLK and Morrell. I still think that that's a good idea. If there's going to be other artwork that's going to be installed, fine by me. But what I'm standing on is the public input and the people that we spoke with that represent the community on the south side said they want this piece of art and they want the art at a certain location. I'm standing with the public on that one because this is what we do as a public body. We listen to the public and respond.  I'm with the public on this one. Whatever the the piece of artwork that got the most votes, that piece of artwork should go at the roundabout at MLK and Morrell. If you want to put another piece of artwork or five or 10 at different locations, I'm cool with that too, because I think art is a great thing. And so I just wanted to make sure that the council understood that we put a lot of work in, we diligently did our thing,  And we hope that everything works out and that the council is able to place this other piece of artwork where it deems necessary.

And I serve on the Jackson Public Arts Commission. And I have submitted, was on the inaugural chair of the Jackson Public Arts Commission in the past. My mouth is really dry.  This past year, JPAC was asked to search for sculpture for the MLK Roundabout. JPAC voted to create the Martin Luther King Roundabout Sculpture Selection Committee. Transparency and communication to the residents of Ward 1 became our greatest goal, to which all who were involved were stellar, did great work.  The MLK Roundabout Committee created guidelines for sculpture selection. The committee felt in order to further cede trust between the city and Ward 1, that the final selection of the awarded sculpture and artist should be left to the Ward 1 public votes.  To assure that the finest pieces were selected, the committee issued a call for sculpture, reviewed, and juried all submitted proposals. Three sculptors were selected from the proposals submitted. Maxwell M.K. of Chicago, Douglas Jones, Chris Turner of Detroit, and Ken Thompson of Blissfield.  The city issued a call for public comment on each sculpture. Email responses were sent to Kelly Hoover. Following the guidelines to further transparency and trust, the committee held public gathering at the MLK Center and invited residents of Ward 1 to come meet each artist and hear their presentation, as well place their vote for the sculpture they wanted to be installed in the MLK roundabout.  Both email votes and in-person votes were tallied and clearly set Maxwell M.K. far out front of Douglas Jones, Chris Turner, slash Chris Turner, there's two working on that one, and Ken Thompson.  Ward 1 had voted Path to Progress by Maxwell M.K. was their choice. The committee believed the correct choice by vote had been made and were ready to proceed to submit our recommendation at an emergency meeting of the Jackson Public Arts Commission, which was bypassed. What we do know is that JPEC bylaws were ignored. Why?  Once the MLK Roundabout Selection Committee left the office of Kelly Hoover, who did a stellar job working on this, the committee is not sure what happened, but we do know the next thing. A community of shapes by Douglas Jones slash Chris Turner was placed on tonight's agenda to be approved for installation, not Maxwell M. Case. This has stunned each committee member  and we all share a level of disrespect of our time and the political sway away from the public vote. Respect, transparency and trust were swept away and the misstepped decision to change the outcome were not respecting Ward 1's community choice, which negates their vote and voice.  This does not grow trust between the city and Ward 1. It only undermines it. I respectfully recommend that the city council amend tonight's agenda line item 11.4 under new business regarding the award of the MLK roundabout sculpture. City County members, please vote to award.

There's a meeting that's coming up  later this month with a state organization and they are putting together the drive to have it on the ballot in November in Jackson and several other communities around the state. It is a growing  of interest by people. They're reading about it all of the time, hearing about it and wanting to be able to use it, but not have to go to the street to find the mushrooms and psychedelics that they feel that they need to overcome depression, PTSD, and other things. Psychedelic Colorado.  They have legalized it for the state. And just this last week, Australia has legalized not only all of the ethnogenics, but MDMA as well. It is a world-growing phenomenon. It's happening. There's more research being done on it. Johns Hopkins, the University of New York, have done mounds of information on it. Bloomberg publishes once a week. They have articles on ethnogenics.  in Bloomberg. Insurance companies have just paid for some in Canada for the use of it. It is coming to Jackson. I would love to see the city  initiate it, take control of it. The city of Ann Arbor and Washtenaw County has approved it, as has Detroit and one other municipality in Oakland County has approved. Detroit passed unanimously by the councils there.  all of them, unanimous, because they did their homework, their research, they looked at it. I found that the directive from the prosecuting attorney in Washtenaw County to be extremely informative, very well written, with just a lot of evidence-based information in there.  Look at it. Read it. Look it up. If you don't know where to find it, you can contact me. I'll get it for you. I have it right here.

JS_02_07_23,JS,"Jackson, MI",2023-02-07,2023-02-01,Training,Public Comment,Commenter,2598.0,2784.0,"Hello, I'm Kelly Casimir, 762 Oak Ridge Drive, and chair of the Environmental Commission. I'm here to speak about No Mo' May. As you're probably aware, the Environmental Commission has written in support of this initiative. I'm here to provide some additional information and hope to address some of the concerns raised by Public Works.  So traditional monoculture lawn lacks floral resources or nesting sites for bees and is often treated with large amounts of pesticides that harm bees and other invertebrates. When we think of habitat loss, we tend to imagine bulldozers and concrete, but acres of manufactured lawn are just as much a loss of habitat as any development site. Bee populations have been in decline for decades due to the combined threats of pesticides, habitat loss, and climate change.  One way to increase bee habitats is by participating in No-Mow May. No-Mow May is a conservation initiative which is gaining traction across North America. The goal of No-Mow May is to allow grasses to grow un-mown for the month of May, creating habitat and forage for early season pollinators. This is particularly important in urban areas where floral resources are often limited.  The start of the growing season is a critical time for hungry, newly emerging native bees. Floral resources may be hard to find and allowing lawns to grow longer and not applying pesticides to flowering plants can provide nectar and pollen to help bee neighbors survive.  Experiments conducted by the USDA Forest Service's Northern Research Station found bee abundance increased when lawns were mowed every other week. Mowing every three weeks resulted in more than double the number of flowers available in lawns and increased bee diversity.  Maintaining bee populations are critical for the security and resiliency of our food supply. In fact, without bees acting as pollinators, 70% of plants would be unable to reproduce or provide food. According to the United Nations Environmental Program, of the 100 crop varieties that provide 90% of our world's food supply, 71 are pollinated by bees.  In North America, honeybees alone pollinate nearly 95 kinds of fruit, such as almonds, avocados, cranberry, apple, in addition to commodity crops like soy. Speaking specifically toward the concerns of public works,  May is not the heart of the growing season. As an avid gardener, the last frost dates for our community are in mid to late May. So this is when snow is often still on the ground and that's the point. There is little state growth and we are trying to encourage the little that is there to exist further. There's also round and turn about blight. As far as I'm aware, we are  talking about backyards only, and this is an opt-in program for what I would imagine to be a small number of actual citizens and city-held properties.

I felt like the DEI  Shouldn't be in any corporation. It shouldn't be taught in Jackson. Why do we really need to teach people how to treat one another? We're all human. I was always taught to treat people how you would like to be treated. I worked for Henry Ford for 25 years. In the past 10 years, they have workshops on this. But in my experience, even though everyone took the class, they didn't enforce it. I was verbally and mentally abused by a coworker.  by a coworker I worked with under, and nothing was done about the harassment I suffered. I feel DEI divides people instead of uniting people. DEI stands for diversity, equity, integrity, and it promotes creativity and culture differences. I have colored my hair for years, along with other staff members at Henry Ford, but they made a policy  stating that you can only have natural hair colors. We argued that goes against diversity. Everybody is different. Everybody has their own style. And to say my colored hair is unacceptable is against policy. I disagreed. But they do not want  They don't, but they do what they want to do. It doesn't matter how many classes and training they take. It's the culture of the workplace that dictates what people can do. I don't think training  DEI to companies in Jackson is a good use of taxpayers' money. In my opinion, it's a waste. Being kind to one another costs nothing, and that's what changes lives. On another note, I want to address Keisha Hamilton, the school board member, saying, would you rather  the entire world be black or white. P. S. Don't hesitate now.

My comments tonight are regarding racist comments made on social media by Ms. Keisha Hamilton, who is the Chair of the City Racial Equity Committee and the JPS Board Trustee. When someone is speaking, tone, nuance, and inflection can be discerned.  In the written word, they cannot. For this reason, our judicial system, when presented with a written communique, a text message, or a written post, they proceed with the words as written. Just the words as written. So Councilman Forgrave, you were correct when you stated context and nuance are the first things to go. This is as it should be.  because Mrs. Hamilton said what she meant. She used the words she meant to use. There is no nuance to change the meaning. If she had meant a particular white woman is stupid, she would have said that. If she meant something other than whiteness is so evil, she would have said that.  If she felt anything she said was misunderstood or taken out of context, she certainly would have clarified that in the comment, those comments by now. Ms. Hamilton has been quite vocal about her disdain for the white race. Ms. Hamilton is referred to white people as evil, stupid, dangerous, dishonest, and more, which is, by definition, racism.  Racism is defined as the belief that race accounts for the differences in character or ability and that a particular race is superior to others. Ms. Hamilton says she cannot be racist because racism must have a power dynamic behind it.  That is linguistic gymnastics. She says she can be biased, discriminatory, and prejudiced, but she cannot be racist. I challenge anyone here to look up racist in a thesaurus and check out its synonyms. You'll find bias, discrimination, and prejudice. That's racism.  Contrary to what Ms. Hamilton says, she can be racist and racism is more egregious when it's displayed by a person in positions of influence as Keisha Hamilton. The failure of this council to condemn racism is disturbing and offensive. The people of Jackson should trust that this council will not condone racism, regardless of who it comes from.

By now everyone is aware of the inappropriate and racist comments made by JPS board member Keisha Hamilton. She said among many other things that whiteness is so evil and that white women are the stupidest and many more outrageous comments. A group of parents and concerned citizens reached out to the JPS board who were also very horrified by her statements. At the January meeting we came to speak and make our voices heard.  What we wanted was for the board to condemn her statements as not aligning with the values of JPS and to ask for her resignation. JPS district encompasses around 4,400 students and their families. These statements shocked the whole community and the news was nationwide.  The vast number of people commenting on the story were disgusted by her message. Do white children have a place in JPS? What about the white teachers, staff? What about biracial kids? Are they included in this?  The number of people in the city is even greater than in JPS. She sits on the city commission and the citizens she affects are around 30,000. Do all citizens feel safe and heard and included with someone making these statements? At the last meeting, John Wilson posed some questions to each and every city council member.  He asked about the content of some of her statements. So he asked, is whiteness evil? He asked, are white women stupid? Actually, the tweet that he was referring to, it didn't say white women are stupid. It said, white women are the stupidest. Actually, only one council member even bothered to respond to John Wilson's questions. That was Will Forgrave of my ward, Ward 6.  His answer was almost worse than no answer. He said, Hamilton's statements, you see, that they're taken out of context and you lose nuance. And what context? What nuance? I really want to know. I hope he explains that. We citizens, parents, grandparents, and the students themselves are really hurting over her statements.  How can we feel safe? We feel like we're in a hostile environment. While I realize JPS is not your responsibility, the city is, and I would like for you to state publicly that City Commissioner Hamilton's statements are 100% not in alignment with the City of Jackson.",General Community Organizing

It's a lengthy report because it does cover three counties, Jackson, Lenawee, and Hillsdale County, but it's rich in data and there might be some information in there that you can utilize.  I also just want to reiterate that Community Action Agency is committed to working with the city on issues related to homelessness and those living in poverty.

Eye of the beholder, my foot. In any sane world, this person would be just another screeching non-entity on the internet. But Keisha Hamilton works for the city of Jackson as the very head of the Racial Equity Commission and serves at the discretion and with the approval of this very body. That's all of you. That's all of you.  Keep in mind that due to national and even international coverage of her public meltdown, it can be safely said that she is now the public face of the city of Jackson, more so than every other elected city official combined. You had a chance to publicly repudiate her, but chose instead to do literally nothing. Now a few words for all the grownups in the room tonight.

Here's a major reality check, guys, and I'm so glad the city attorney and city manager are in the room tonight. Here's a major reality check. The next time a white employee of the city of Jackson decides to litigate a discrimination claim against you, what does a male lawyer has to do?  All he has to do is blow up Keisha Hamilton's social media posts and put them on poster board on a stand as exhibits for all the jury and judge to see. He will he's a note that the mayor and city council aided and abetted this racial arsonist instead of taking away the matches. Not good.  At that point, the only question is whether the plaintiff settles with you for seven, eight, or nine figures. Imagine that. You're going to want to settle that, too, because if a claim goes to trial, this building you're sitting in tonight might well have a new owner and might get redeveloped for some of those downtown condos that you always seem to be so very excited to talk about. We have a new order grave. Your redevelopment at the end of the last meeting works for you often, contemptible, highly unprofessional, and immoral.  As a resident of the 6th Ward, I'm calling for your immediate resignation. If you fail to do so, you will be a special political project for 2023, and you will be exposed to all your constituents as the person of frankly low character that you are.

My first comment is regarding the gun violence proclamation. I read through it and this proclaimed some good objectives because we all are compassionate towards those who have suffered from gun violence.  However, the community's opinions on solutions vary greatly. Legislation is the process of making laws and rules, and the problem is that the wicked do not conform to rules or laws.  The focus needs to be on transforming the wicked with truth, morals, and character, while allowing the law-abiding citizens to protect themselves and others. And those that refuse to abide must suffer severe consequences for their actions, and in turn may cause others to rethink their violent actions. But with this proclamation, I don't agree that firearms are the leading cause of death for children.  We all know that abortion is the leading cause of death for children. But I am glad that the proclamation declares a desire to value human lives. My second comment is in response to last meeting's councilman's comments.  I agree with the mayor's comment that some things don't warrant a discussion, but a public figure appointed by the city who needs correction does does warrant discussion, especially if those who oversee it will not address it.  I do not want to feed racism and division. She, Ms. Hamilton, is the one who has been feeding herself with false indoctrination and insists on poisoning others with her public comments.  And Mr. Forgrave, context matters. What reasoning women are we talking about? Is it ever okay to say negative things about a particular group, whether it's based on race, gender, short or fat people? It's never okay. They are divisive and hurtful words.  and you don't know where to draw the line, I want to personally recommend that you study the Bible. That's the best advice, where to draw the lines. But we do need to draw the line at right and wrong. And we are so tired of it too. We can't stop wicked people and organizations from paying her to speak  to speak, and yes she has the right to free speech, but we also have the right to say we cannot have public representatives who use words to speak bigotry and hate and fear.

I dare say no one in this room believes that if a white employee of the city of Jackson posted on a social media platform, blackness is so evil, as a black employee posted whiteness is so evil, that they would keep their job. They may even face a hate crime charge. To allow an employee of the city to post inflammatory, derogatory,  and racist comments on a public platform and to go unanswered in a city literally founded on the abolition of slavery is wrong.

What I want to talk about tonight was the, I guess you could call it a debacle, on the sculpture that was placed, you know, looking to be placed at the ML King. Ms. Robinson, I felt bad for you last week. I could see the frustration in your eyes. I could see it through your body language. Okay, here we had a situation where the city did everything right. We had a diverse group of people from MLK, CIA, Arts Commission,  We had a council person on there. We had a racial equity commission people on there. They took their time. They went through the process as good as you can do it. They found the popular vote. And then another name shows up on the agenda, okay? And obviously it caused a little bit of chaos. I believe that that was generated mostly by Mayor Mahoney who was saying, you know, they didn't fill  our bid qualifications out correctly, okay? Ms. Gunn asked a question. Ms. Robinson was on it. If only one of the three sculptures that were voted on fit if the qualifications, how come that wasn't done before we had the open house and before we presented three of them? There should have only been one sculpture to vote on. Now, I don't know if Mr. Mahoney has any allegiances to the Doug Jones  You know, I suspect that maybe the conversation went like this, well, you know, you're one of the three running right here. If you don't get the vote, I'll figure out a way to get your sculpture through, which he is attempting to do because tonight you have an approval of another sculpture, okay? The city taxpayers that went through the process, you did everything according to Hoyle, the city taxpayers should not be on the hook for another $30,000 bill to satisfy  Mr. Mahoney's needs, okay? So you have that on here tonight. If you guys want to erect another sculpture, go through the same process that you just did, okay?

But being 30 miles from our two largest universities and the most expensive housing in the state, we still need to push Jackson into a charming collection of neighborhoods, parks, and showpiece landmarks that draw new citizens a little farther than Chelsea or Mason to the waiting gem that could be Jackson.  The Hayes Hotel stands a few feet next door to our historic Carnegie Library. That is an advantage we should exploit. Instead of two isolated library centerpieces, find a way to link the two, creating a downtown living room for Jackson.  A retiree should be able to leave the Hayes apartment and wander the library stacks without ever stepping outside. A warm chatter of a Hayes front window coffee shop should raise library patrons through the archway for a break.  Patrons not finding a book to borrow may buy a new or used book in a library bookstore or part of the Hayes Complex. The library's stone front facade faces the warm southern sun all winter.

He plays up the politics of the Sheriff Rand situation, but totally dismisses the racism and hate of someone who affects the lives of the community's children and sits on a city board for which he and others here on the council have ultimate authority over.

He led the effort to see that nearly $200,000 went to Residence in Action with the equity thing being the driving force.

Not coincidentally, Keisha Hamilton is close friends with the residents and action crew, and I assume a RIA member herself.

Speaking of gun violence in the city, this anti-Second Amendment resolution on the agenda tonight, it's all about the Democratic Party's attempt to take the guns out of law-abiding citizens.

I'm here to give a unsolicited but brief update on some stuff we've been doing at the environmental commission. You all moved to pass no more may a two weeks ago and we appreciate that. It did bring to light that there were a couple of gaps in some of our thinking about that. So I had a great opportunity to visit with DPW and talk about some of the creative ways that we can work around, um, some of the potential issues of no more may.  So we're going to make an effort to work with Aaron Dimmick and other relevant city staffers to make sure that our messaging around NOMO may make sense. Our messaging is clear to people and it does not serve as an undue burden for, uh, for DPW and all that they do. Um, I'd also like to briefly take this opportunity to, um, encourage the passage of the RFP. I also had a great opportunity because of that visit to DPW to visit the water treatment plant.  And I will say, if you have not had an opportunity to be there recently, definitely reach out to Mike and make an opportunity to go. They're doing amazing work, as you know. But I think even myself, as somebody who studied water and studied environmental science in college, we don't realize  the magnitude of the work that goes into managing the plant, um, how much they accomplish with how little they have in terms of robust staffing and opportunities. Um, but I really think city staff should be commended for that and should continue to get as many resources as we can afford them for the improvement of the plant and the improvement to the water system and the continued training.  Lastly, I will say that normal may actually is really important. It's good for pollinators, and May 20th is our freeze date in Jackson. I always tell people I don't know a lot about agriculture, just a little bit. I'm more of a forestry guy myself, but May 20th is our freeze date, and a freeze date means, excuse me, a freeze date means 50% chance that we're going to drop below 32. It is much lower that we're gonna drop below 28 degrees and actually kill the grass in a hard freeze,  But we are at a 50% chance in the third week of May to plant things.

Uh, I am here today, uh, asking the city council to adopt a resolution, um, decriminalizing and theogenic plants and medicine. Uh, I started getting headaches in my early teens. By the time I was in college, I was diagnosed with cluster headaches. Those are also called suicide headaches because of the, uh,  I think it's like 20 times more likely that people that suffer from them are to commit suicide because of how seriously life-impacting they are. I was prescribed an off-label gout medicine to treat my headaches. I dealt with that until I graduated from college, got a job working for the state, and I had read about how you could go to Canada and get psilocybin mushroom therapy for the specific types of headaches that I had. I didn't dare discuss that with anybody that I worked with at the time for fear of  losing my job or having it negatively impact me. I left the state in 2016 and was gifted a small, like an eighth gram or an eighth of a mushroom chocolate. I had a lovely evening in my house. About two months later, I realized that I hadn't had a headache since I had eaten mushrooms. I then went on a little journey of trying to track down the people that made them or trying to access them safely, which resulted in me having to drive to Detroit every couple of months to be able to get mushrooms safely.  I've since figured out how to cultivate them myself to have them more easily accessible.  but the impact that not or being able to have them has had on my life is astonishing and life-changing, and the more I go talk about them, the more you meet people that have also had life-changing impacts from a plant. Every single day, there are new articles in the Washington Post and the New York Times and literally every single piece of media we consume about the benefits of them. It is not a matter of if mushrooms are going to be  Prevalent in our community.

I want to thank the council for having this open forum for us to be able to speak. I think you've heard me before. I'm talking about ethnogenics again. And I just wanted to give you a little bit of an update as to what is going on in the city of Jackson for that. I attended a meeting last night. It's a fundraiser and an information gathering.  They found that it will only take about 383 signatures to petition the council, and moving forward, and the goal is to have that to you in August, which will put us within the 90-day limit of the November election.  So it's moving forward. I'm hoping that the city would take a look at Ann Arbor's ordinance that they passed unanimously. All of the cities and townships that have passed ethnogenics of decriminalization in Michigan have all passed by the councils unanimously.  It's a good, well thought out education. There was a ton of references in both the council's ordinance as well as in the prosecuting attorney's decision to not prosecute within the county of Washtenaw.  And so I'm hoping that you'll take the time to look at those, consider it for Jackson, be a leader within the state and not just a follower across. It's happening everywhere, it's in the news. One of my concerns is in education and people who are, they're hearing it and seeing it on the news and wanting to possibly try them.  for microdosing, for PTSD, depression, a whole host of things. And my concern is one of the drugs that they talk about on there is MDMA. MDMA used to be called ecstasy. Well, it still is in its purest form. But you don't know when you go to the street what you're getting. Most of it is now considered to be molly. Molly is cut primarily with methamphetamine and opioids, which would be heroin.  and or fentanyl, which puts people at risk if they don't have the comfort to be able to go and seek information from reliable sources and puts them at risk. So please consider those ordinances. You can find them online.

I hope you looked that up, but I haven't heard from you. Then I want to talk about 11-3, the parks mowing and irrigation contract. Freddie, you're my assistant.  You're my council person. I want to make sure that you find out that there is not going to be any herbicide used in the cemeteries desecrating the graves of our ancestors.  Finally, I want to mention the idea of a transition to an even year election. I am in support of this, simply because of the additional number of people we would get out to participate in the election. And I think the more community participation we have in elections, the better representation that we will get in the people who are elected to public office.

Consumers Energy doesn't have Christian morals. They worship the almighty dollar, and that's like they fly the rainbow flag. So, you know, Christian values, they don't worship that. Jacob Bent, in a sense, your last meeting,  responded to me about the no mow Monday or no mow May. He said grass dies if the temperature goes down to 28. Well, if you think about it, if all the grass, you know, all the grass would have died already this year and it would just been dirt. It's just really silly of him. So, again, with no mow Monday, hopefully change your mind and get rid of that.  He was talking with the DPW director out there kind of cornered him and you know eventually went on a tour of a plant and stuff now with the Committees and commissions are sort of like the council. They're not supposed to be giving directions to city employees And so that's something that he needs to take into consideration also Mayor Mahoney last Thursday in the line stand mentioned that  He talks with Chief Hitt and kind of mentioned he told Chief Hitt, oh, let's do this. The charter specifically prohibits that, so unfortunately, Mayor Mahoney's not here. Hopefully, you know, he's watching this and knows he's not supposed to do that. For the elections, the city clerk was on JTV and mentioned  to adjust the even years that the terms for the first time would be increased by a year, the mayor would go to three years, but when the charter passed it, that wasn't the case. It would be  at one point the mayor would be like just a one-year term to get it to even years and then the council members it would be three years not five years so hopefully you get that corrected. Speaking of the city clerk you know I looked at or may ask  And I finally, you know, looked it up and I guess it's like the African American, you know, I've seen Marcus Garvey created and stuff like that. So, you know, it would be nicer if she had like the American flag or the, you know, the great,  one she had. Joe Biden mentioned a soldier getting the Medal of Honor that there was racism and him not being awarded it, but there's white in everything that have the same situation. So it's just the race that I keep complaining about that's being used. Thank you, Madam Vice Mayor.",Governance and Civic Engagement

I'm Daniel Greer, eight 10 Loomis street, former chairman of the charter review committee, which was appointed at the end of 2017 and began our work in 2018.  uh, to review the charter, to look for any necessary proposed amendments. Um, our work was interrupted, uh, with some different factors, including COVID. Um, and we wrapped up and I was, uh, able to present the chair charter review committee's recommendations to the city council.  via the zoom meeting back in June of 2020 and as some of you were here then and some of you weren't, um, just wanted to come up to speak about the changing, uh, the election years from odd years to even years. That was a recommendation. It was one of the three final recommendations that the charter review committee, uh, put forth for the council's consideration.  and whether or not to place that before the voters. It warms my heart to hear that you are now taking up one of those recommendations, again, to change from odd-year elections to even years. I believe, while the committee has been dissolved, I think I would speak on my former fellow committee members' behalf and say that we're glad that you're taking this up.  And actually I would acknowledge Mr King who was an unofficial member of the committee cause he was at every meeting, uh, that the, uh, he is correct on our proposal did say that the mayor would serve a one year term.  in order to get it to the even years. But I'm glad you're taking it up. I understand it will be coming back to the next meeting. So maybe I'll be back to speak on that. I certainly hope you would go ahead and make this change by resolution as the charter and state law allow you to do, rather than putting it before the voters. And thank you for all of your hard work, each and every one of you. I'm proud of my fellow citizens for coming out and speaking tonight. And see you soon. Thanks.",Governance and Civic Engagement

I just want to reiterate what John C. King has said and the things he's been tracking with the nonprofit organizations in Jackson. He is 100% right.  that a lot of disaster emergency relief funding is being abused by them. It is being used for political lobbying. As you see in the last, I don't know, six months or so, a lot of people are abusing their jobs. They're greatly overstepping the boundaries of the, um, the nonprofit status that they're supposed to represent. And it does place those agencies in jeopardy of losing their five one c three licensing by constantly lobbying the city council.  So those things should be noted and will for grave. You are wrong for supporting Keisha Hamilton and what she said 100%. No question about it. I would never. I'm a black person. I would never support what she said.

I guess these black women are not fans of Dr.  Luther Dr. Luther King Jr. I wasn't aware Jackson, Michigan was so racist. I said, Jackson isn't racist. There are us. There is no place for this hatred, especially from someone on the school board. He said, nice to know. I always had a high respect for Jackson, Michigan. She is tainting our city.  But besides that, when another lady spoke out about Keisha not even being here to defend herself and what happened at the high school and the shooting threat,  Uh, he informed me that his principal, because it happened across the state, that his principal sent him an email saying that it was a exercise that wasn't conveyed to anybody in Jackson County.

Thank you, Honorable Council Members. Today I'm here just to talk about support of the Fair Chance Housing bill that we'll be dropping in April statewide, so nation outside. I am the Manager of Engagement and MidMichigan Regional Coordinator with Nation Outside.  Today, I'm just going to discuss a little bit about the ordinance. So Fair Chance Housing was passed here in Jackson in 2021. And what Fair Chance Housing does, it prohibits landlords from asking potential tenants about their conviction history during the initial screening process. It postpones any background check until a conditional lease is offered. It prevents landlords from unfairly denying applicants housing solely based on their criminal history, unless that record would impact public safety,  property, or other tenants adversely. And it allows potential tenants to offer evidence of rehabilitation prior to final denial by the landlord. So over 2 million people in Michigan have a criminal record, and as a result, face barriers to employment, food, and shelter. Nearly 45,000 laws and statutes face people returning home from prison that exclude them from access to basic life necessities.  While efforts are being made by state and local reformers to address barriers to employment, people with records often struggle to find safe and affordable housing. The result is that formerly incarcerated people often accept living in dangerous, dilapidated, and yet overpriced housing or become homeless.  In fact, recent research has shown that formerly incarcerated people are ten times more likely to experience homelessness than the general population. In other research, 79% of the study's participants were denied housing based on their own or a family member's conviction history. The Fair Chance Housing Ordinance seeks to expand housing opportunities for people with records who have served their time and are seeking to provide for themselves and their families.  This is important because stable and safe housing leads to reduced recidivism and increased public safety. When formerly incarcerated people have access to secure housing, they are more likely to be employed. And communities are more stable and economically viable when people have access to housing, jobs, and education.  So I thank you guys for listening to me today, and I know there was some other housing issues discussed today, but housing is one of our most basic needs. And just to be in support of a fair chance housing statewide push could make some great changes for not only our incarcerated populations, but their families and our communities as well. Thank you guys. You're welcome. Thank you. And ladies in general.",Housing

I'm here to speak on fair chance housing as well. So home is much more than a place. Home is where we live. Home holds the memories to time spent with friends and family.  It's a place where we yearn to go and end of a hard day and long to return to after a long road trip. But for over 2 million Michiganders, home is elusive. People with records often struggle to find safe and affordable housing. The result is that justice impacted people are often  accepted in living in dangerous, dilapidated, and yet overpriced housing, or become homeless. 63% of Michigan landlords indicate that criminal records were a factor in denying tenancy.  The Fair Chance Housing, the Fair Chance Housing seeks to expand housing opportunities for people with records who have served their time and are seeking to provide for themselves and their families. Now, me personally, I did 21 years. I went to prison at 16. I've been home three years now. So for me personally, coming home and anybody that I know, like I did 21 years, the whole time I've never heard not one person ever say they don't want to go home. Right. So when they come home,  or when they get released, not everybody has a home. Now, I understand homelessness did not kill them people, but it also didn't help them either. So if you want these individuals that are returning home from prison to become successful, home, a place to lay their head and feel safe, is the most concrete thing you can do to help these individuals succeed in life.",Housing

It was times where trying to get a home, I was coming to a point to where, why should I say I've done some things that I'm not proud of and I'm a felon? But I didn't do that. But as I said, but as of 2020, 2021,  I respect the fact that this city passed that. So it gives a person coming home from prison a chance to do better in society.

I'm a homeowner who resides in the City of Jackson at 716 West High Street.  I've lived in the city for 30 years. I have owned and maintained my home and the entirety of my property for 15 years.  I live in a historic subdivision formerly owned by the Morgan Estate, and anyone who knows the history of Jackson is familiar with that name. I'm not here to give a history lesson, but I want to say I've been paying attention to community development in the city, which is equally important as maintaining the integrity of our historic neighborhoods, and that's why I'm here today.  I sent an email last week to all city council members with my concerns for the forced replat of the subdivision which is occurring in my neighborhood that I learned of in September of last year. The replat of the subdivision has resulted in the closure of vehicle access to my property and my garage in October of last year.  I share this access with a neighbor to the west of me and our garages were built based on the subdivision plat as it is officially recorded at the Jackson County Register of Deeds since 1916.  The neighbor to the north of us made it known in September that they are working with a community development city official. And they were informed by the community development city official that they would work with them and the Department of Public Works to remove the curb cuts and replace them in a location 16 feet to the south.  My neighbors and I rely on the access as this is our only means of access to our properties and we oppose of the replant. I hold the deed to my property and my deed specifically references the alley and the neighbor's deed to the north does not have any reference to the alley whatsoever because they have their own driveway.  I have not sold my property to any of my neighbors. The neighbor has not been informed, I'm sorry, the neighbor has not been informed by any official, I'm sorry, the neighborhood and I have not been informed by any city official of a replat of the subdivision and we oppose of the replat of the subdivision. The neighbor to the north of us has not obtained any building permits  yet has torn down the boundary line fence, installed a second driveway.",Urban Development

Detroit, Ann Arbor, Washtenaw County have all decriminalized entheogenic substances. Within the last month, Hazel Park and Ferndale have passed unanimous ballot resolutions  within their city councils, um, adopting or decriminalizing and theogenic substances. Um, I said the last time that I spoke here, it is not a matter of if, but when psilocybin and other things will be allowed in the city of Jackson and throughout the state. Um, on March 17th we are hosting a meeting with the decriminalized nature Michigan chapter at the seed seller in Jackson. I would like to encourage all of you and everybody in the audience to come and kind of hear  What's moving forward as far as the statewide ballot initiatives and what we're going to start working on in Jackson to get it on the November ballot if the council chooses not to proceed forward with a  resolution on their own. If the state does choose to adopt a statewide ballot resolution, we feel like it provides less equitable access for people to get those different types of things. And, you know, Jackson is a community that has a lot of residents that are in need of healing, and we feel like it would be a, you know, a definite benefit to the community to adopt an early resolution for them. Mr. Malfort pointed out the financial aspect that Jackson missed out on when medical marijuana moved forward.  We're confident that the statewide ballot initiative will lead to some sort of medical proposal similar to that. So again, we're just asking Jackson to be on the forefront of this opportunity.

We spend our money and we live in Jackson, Michigan.  I spoke at the February 7th council meeting concerning Keisha Hamilton and the stain her racial slurs have put on Jackson.

Rather than to take into consideration community members' concerns and that they took time to prepare comments and face the fear of speaking publicly for this council, the council chose to demean and belittle those speakers.  Mayor Mahoney, who I wish he was here tonight, but he's not, made some very snide and disparaging comments like, well, they probably don't even live in the city, and just devalued their opinions. And the people that don't live in the city limits but still have a Jackson address, they spend their money here. They support Jackson.  Councilman Forgraves, your arrogant comments pertaining to how they researched and prepared their comments is beneath your position as a council member. You belittled them. You've repeatedly defended Ms. Hamilton's comments, citing context and nuance. Well, this is a quote from her interview on the lion's den. When she was given the opportunity to explain her comments, she emphatically replied, I meant exactly what I said.  Case closed. You can try to spend nuance on it or context, but Ms. Hamilton's quite articulate and she said exactly what she meant to say. When her comments went from the local news to the national news and then international news, it didn't just tarnish Jackson Public Schools, it didn't just taint people that live in Jackson City proper,  It, she sullied the honor, the character, and the image of Jackson, all of Jackson, people that live on the outskirts, everybody.

It spends money on large executive salaries. It spends money on court cases against the city. It spends no money now for its water out at its plant, the Jackson Generating Station, because it left the city system.  It went to EGLE, formerly the DEQ, and said, can we have a permit to take 5 million gallons a day? Actually, the permit is for 7.5 million, but they say they're only going to operate using 5 million or less. 5 million gallons of water a day out of your aquifer, and they're not paying a penny for it.  so that they can prolong the life of this plant, which is generating electricity. And apparently now the water, our water, water is life. Our water is worth more than that electricity. So they went and  decided to get that water for free. I hope everybody is just aware of that, that this company has been a major polluter of air and water in the state of Michigan for 80, 90 years. They are the 38th largest emitter of greenhouse gas in the country. I don't remember their rank in terms of water. They shut down a couple of coal pants.  and a couple other polluting plants.

Now the people are coming to you to partner and give us the rights and freedoms to choose to use ethnogenic plants without fear of an outdated, failed war on drugs.

Ethnogenics are moving quickly across the United States and in Michigan. Like I said last time I was here, there are now four municipalities in Michigan where the city council has passed the decriminalization of ethnogenics within their municipality by unanimous vote.  It's my goal, I hope, that we can get the City Council here to give us a unanimous vote as well. So, but if we can't, we are planning on going to the ballot in November, and I can tell you we've got enough volunteers right now to get signatures that it could almost just sign the ballot initiatives to get it on the  on its own.

I'm the Community Engagement Specialist for Nation Outside. Mr. Mayor and Honorable City Council Members. Nation Outside would like to take a moment to thank you for always being on the side of justice. On January 14, 2020, this Honorable Council adopted a resolution recommending that the state of Michigan pass legislation to expand expungement. Several months later, the legislation was signed into law in October of 2020. In March of 2021, this council again was on the cutting edge  when it adapted the Fair Chance Housing Ordinance to advance the ability of people with criminal records to access housing. Nation Outside has returned again to ask this council once again to put, once again, push the state forward by resolving that the state of Michigan should adapt Fair Chance Housing for all of Michigan. As a refresher, the Fair Chance Housing, the Fair Chance, the Fair Housing Ordinance will prohibit landlords from asking potential tenants about their conviction history during the initial screening process  Postpone any background check until a conditional lease is offered. Prevent landlords from unfairly denying applicants housing solely based on their criminal history unless the record would impact public safety, property, or the other tenants adversely. Allow potential tenants to offer evidence of rehabilitation prior to final denial by the landlord. This is important because stable and safe housing leads to reduced recidivism and increased public safety.  When formerly incarcerated people have access to secure housing, they are more likely to be employed. Communities are more stable and economically viable when people have access to housing, jobs, and education. The Fair Chance Housing Act seeks to expand housing opportunities for people with records who have served their time and are seeking to provide themselves and their families. We thank you for allowing us to present here today, and we look forward to a statewide push to become successful.",Housing

There never seemed to be any real answers Follow-through or basic account of accountability from City Council or the mayor? Maybe it's not fair to ask very much from the mayor who has been so very very busy lately setting up nonprofits to solicit donations from various local businesses and entities many of whom do business with the city and  while acting as Bearer of Jackson. This is classic pay to play and a basic conflict of interest. This is selling City Hall itself to the highest bidder, yet the members of this council sit on their collective behinds like bored school children and say and do nothing.  Still more unanswered questions. Where's the full accounting of public funds spent by Residents in Action? We're asking for that week after week, month after month. Why isn't that posted online for all to see? What exactly are the personal and financial ties of members of Residents in Action to members of this city government, government's officials, including city council and the mayor?  It is alleged that Residence in Action has previously run people out of their group due to their race. Where's the public inquiry into this allegation? It is alleged also that Residence in Action is picking and choosing beneficiaries of the tax money that they are spending based on their race as well. Where's the public inquiry into this allegation? You have failed as a body to perform due diligence, and when the full unvarnished truth about RIA comes to light, there will be nowhere to run, nowhere to hide, and no one to blame but yourselves.  Now, you want to build a homeless campus in Jackson so your friends and acquaintances can continue to milk federal grant money. Imagine what downtown would look like with scores, if not hundreds, of aggressive panhandlers, needles, garbage, and human waste everywhere. San Francisco literally spent $1.1 billion, that's billion with a B, on homeless programs in 2021 to 2022 alone.  And that city is so fallen that there are smartphone apps showing people where human waste and piles of needles are so they can be avoided by pedestrians.  $2.8 billion has been spent on homeless programs in that one city since 2016. And the end result is a 56% increase, 56% increase in homelessness and large businesses and citizens in flight out of that state never to return. This is exactly what you are inviting into Jackson with open arms, not because you are noble humanitarians, you are not.  but also elected officials can get a giant fresh pile of federal dollars to dish out to family and friends. There are going to be some very pointed discussions to be had with all of you on the campaign trail this year.",Governance and Civic Engagement

We still don't get to see how council members voted.  This is a technology thing that has taken months now. It shouldn't take that long. And we're not reset to daylight savings time on our clock either here. So just little things. Maybe you can get to work on that. I want to talk about Jackson a little.  You know, someone mentioned last week it's a Rust Belt city. We had all our manufacturing leave because of the decision of some people in charge of automotive companies who wanted cheaper labor. And they moved first the facilities down south, like to Tennessee and, you know, Alabama, and then they moved facilities to Mexico and China. And we exported our manufacturing technology to China, and now all of a sudden we're trying to, you know, recreate it.  Now, that left us with excess housing. There was a lot of, you know, vacant homes, people that, you know, weren't here, absentee landlords, created some dilapidated conditions, and the city decided to use federal funds to destroy all these houses. So the city created  the housing shortage we are now facing and the homeless issues we're now facing. Okay? I mean, that's the reality. Derek Dobies and Patrick Birch did that. I don't want to put any blame on the mayor. He wasn't here at the time. He was at the county.  I don't want to put any blame on Jonathan Green, the city manager. He was at the Department of Public Works. Neither one of these individuals were responsible, and this council has changed somewhat. But there are people on here that voted for all those demolitions. And that is what created our current crisis. We took a lot of good housing or housing that could have been rehabilitated and demolished it.  Now, I'm all in support of the city re-energizing its tax base, particularly with single family homes. Because what has happened is with all the new construction of apartments, there's been a transfer of wealth from individual homeowners to investors.  in apartment buildings. That's what's happened. Let's be real about that. So I think the proposal to bring single family homes into some of these vacant lots is an excellent proposal. I think that's good long term for the city. It's good for building a tax base. And it's good that people will be able to own these homes. Now, if they're just rentals.  That's a little bit of a different matter. Once again, I'd like to see the people who are working class, the people who have jobs, to be able to own a home. That's the first thing that gives you some stability in this culture, where you're not giving all your money to a landlord. Thank you, Mr. Mahoney.",Housing

It's interesting that they would come here, the company that was presented, and make comments about how Jackson is specifically mentioned when they're going around the state and trying to do business. Oh, sorry, sorry. I said it's interesting that Jackson is specifically mentioned by the company that has previously presented as an area to do business and look for these vacant lots and stuff.  This is something that I called out about 10 years ago, the rapid decrease in housing. Cities are being incentivized to knock down all of the single family homes in the areas and then sell these lots for next to nothing to developers who want to come in and dominate, completely dominate small cities. And when they say there's a shortage of housing and all this sort of stuff,  I don't really believe that because if you look at cities like Detroit, they used to have 2 million people that lived there. And now it's floating around like 600,000 or something due to several decades of harmful policies that are being pushed in the name of  Affirmative action, things like this. And they have not actually helped the people that they claimed the federal money was going to support. You see that there are more people, women and minorities, absolutely buried in debt with these college programs. Insurmountable debt that they will never be able to afford to pay off. So out of the $2 trillion of student loan debt, right now almost all that is held by women and minorities. So was that a success or a failure? I don't think it was a success.  And a lot of the policies that people are bringing up now were things that the same parties did, you know, 20, 30 years ago, consistently knocking down on the houses, getting the same recommendations from organizations. Now they're saying to do the opposite. They said, oh, yeah, it'd be a good idea to knock down all these houses in the name of blight, and we can get state money or federal grants or whatever. They did that.  Well, there's not enough places for people to live, but your population has decreased such a dramatic rate. Jackson is a city that is built for about anywhere from 75,000 to maybe 100,000 people. We currently have about 30,000 people here. There are plenty of places to live. There's plenty of space to live. Private landlords are struggling to fill their apartments and they're getting nickel and dime left and right.  on all these inspection fees and that it can never seem to pass. And it's always something because you have these complexes or just the field of industry itself, I think is sort of complex to navigate. But the nonprofit organizations that are getting tons of money to develop here are seemingly skirting all regulations of any kind, which they're supposed to have more rules. And under the city of Jackson, they have, it seems like none. Thank you.",Housing

Uh, Brian Farkas, uh, 1415 Parker street, Detroit, Michigan.  Um, thank you for having me here. Mr. Mayor, uh, city council. Um, I'm here representing Allen Edwin home builders. Uh, we're looking at a substantial investment in the city, uh, on vacant own land. And before we get into the details of the proposal, I think it's interesting if we go through the context of where we are in the state. Um, currently we're experiencing an unprecedented housing shortage, um, at all income levels, primarily the missing middle, uh, workforce housing that's defined as the 80 to 120% of the area median income.  In response to this, the state legislature recently changed the MSHDA laws to allow for a pilot, a payment in lieu of taxes. Traditionally, this was done for low-income housing programs. It was below 80%. Because of the unprecedented shortage, they've increased the AMI to 120%. So we can now work directly with municipalities to do payment in lieu of taxes for housing programs that are in that category.  So why we're here in Jackson? In traveling around the state, Jackson's name kept on coming up. You got to work in Jackson. I went down to Tecumseh about a month ago, and Jackson was specifically held up as a place that's very friendly to developers. The building officials are friendly. The guidelines are very clear. It's easy to do business there. That's one of the reasons why we're here.  Also the availability of vacant land is something we're very interested in. So the proposal before you, um, encompasses about 136, uh, vacant lots. Um, we're going to do that in small chunks. Uh, we're going to go slow. We're going to make sure we're doing it right, but we want to build out, um, 100 and some houses and, uh, four to five years. So I think you get the PA before you, if there's any questions, I'm happy to take that. I'll respect the format. Mr. Mayor, I'll look to you. How are you going to proceed?",Housing

Uh, that was a recommendation of the,  previous charter review committee and you all have that information. I don't think I need to reiterate my support for doing that. Um, it should, uh,  save the city money and possibly even increase voter turnout and make elections more efficient.

So I purposely requested that this item go on your consent calendar.  I would hope that no one pulls this off the consent calendar, in my opinion, to vote this down, in other words. That's the only action that you can do. It would be to take it off the consent calendar to vote it down, which, in my opinion, is simply grandstanding, and I encourage you to not do that. Don't make this a campaign issue because it's really peanuts, folks. Let's face it. It's not something worth arguing over.

Locally, the city of Jackson has decided to push the big con job of residents in action, including in the newsletter. The newsletter has a photo of Rhea CEO allegedly preparing food of all things, healthy salads.  As we all here know, that is a deception, a big lie, really, to try to counteract the truth that Ria's meals were really things like hot dogs and junk food. The newsletter also tries to counteract the truth that a great majority of the so-called homeless in the city have drug abuse and mental health issues. The sheriff's office posted on Facebook a few days after the story about a man, a blind man, at America's best motel  that has further evidence of how poorly the money and efforts the city has put towards residents in action has been spent. Then there's the money committed to the pallet shelters and T.A. Wilson school that won't be available until the weather is warmer, maybe even hot. The city council has misspent city resources and there still is no data online regarding much of it.  to reward itself on the genesis of the resolution to move to even year elections in which the next future term each council member here very well may be running for will increase by a year. As I addressed in my email to this council, Connor Wood and the city clerk are using a subsection of a statute that addresses a term of office in which someone is already serving to address  to address a future term. It means an election can't be held next year, 2024 for at four awards, one, three and five. Later in the statute, it states terms can't be more than four years. If this council wants to move to even your elections, it needs to be ethical and follow the law and do as the city charter review committee proposed with the aid of the city attorney.

Jackson, firstly, I'd like to thank you for your time and introduce myself. My name is Peyton Louder, and I'm the current Miss Jackson Crossroads, which is the local preliminary to Miss America. And I've spent almost my entire year of service local to our community. And with that, I've noticed so many extraordinary things that often stem from a problem or two. And because of this, there have been a lot of cause and effect. For example, the cause is how many of our city's children can't afford an outfit for their special school event.  The effect is that the Creating Sparks group girls mentorship that I had the privilege of getting to work with right down at the King Center brought in over 25 formal dresses and evening gowns for free so that the girls could celebrate their special days while looking as good as they felt.  At one point, the cause of fundraising for Jackson Public Schools somehow ended with the effect of me, Sasson Crown, soaking wet in a dunk tank. The city of Jackson is my hometown, and I'm simply here to play a small role in its improvement. Because of the Miss Jackson Crossroads Scholarship Program, I've paid off my entire first semester at Jackson College in an evening gown.  and I had fun doing it. I've gained confidence, I can speak publicly, sort of, and have learned interview and professional development skills that I'm gonna carry with me for the rest of my life. But for right now, I'm gearing up for the Miss Michigan scholarship competition that's in June, where I'll be competing for over $25,000 in college scholarships. The Miss America organization is the largest scholarship provider for young women in the country, so why aren't more of Jackson's youth getting involved?  This is where we circle back to the evening gowns that I started with, the flashiness of the tiaras and the outdated stereotypes that surround the pageant girls. So today, I'm here to shatter that stereotype that you might have previously had. And for the rest of my year, you can find me serving Jackson at every given opportunity, changing the way that our community sees pageant girls, and most importantly, how it sees serving and mentoring our youth.

So if you didn't realize that the city of Jackson's venture into being a homeless services provider, if you didn't realize that that was a fantasy based on cotton candy social justice dreams,  All you need to do is look outside.  I was driving downtown and I saw a homeless man standing right in front, and I mean right in front of the drop-off box in front of City Hall, shaking down an elderly woman, trying to leave a payment for the city. You know the guys who pay for all you guys and pay for the building? Yeah, one of those nice people. He was young and tall and probably quite intimidating to her. He was an aggressive panhandler, the likes of which are defended in public policy by this city council.  Just two people voted in favor of the measure to ban aggressive panhandling, that being Will Forgrave and Karen Bunnell. The rest of the council at that time spouted a bunch of social justice talking points. So, make no mistake, this city does not represent an elderly woman trying to pay her water bill or taxes. This city is on the side, clearly, unmistakably,  of aggressive, menacing, and abusive panhandlers who prey on law-abiding citizens and taxpayers. And there's an update. I was driving downtown today, right about 3.30, maybe 3.32, and he was back. He was back, six foot tall, standing right in front of your drop-off box to hassle people, the ones who pay the taxes and pay for everything, without whom this building would be vacant.  So, you can claim to be the guardian angels of downtown development, but this is just another way in which you throw small businessmen and women to the wolves. So, why is this? I ask myself, why is this? Why is this the case? The reason this is the case is there are two classes of citizen in Jackson, Michigan. There are residents, taxpayers, and homeowners, like myself, who have been second-class citizens for some time now, and then there are the friends and family of the chummy little club that runs City Hall.  This is the reason that our mayor operates multiple nonprofits while sitting in office, as does Mr. John Willis, who has paid quite a generous salary from the city.

She was picking up yet another theft-related felony conviction seven or so years ago. This may be equity to this council, but find another partner if the over $1 million you're applying for comes through. Regarding the resolution to move to even-year elections and the legal manner in which it was being done,  The city attorney was asked for his opinion. Rather than speaking on any of the language in the statutes, he complimented the work of the city clerk and deferred to her for the legal opinion. This is the same city clerk who refuses to offer the slightest amount of aid to people regarding elections. Why would the city's attorney do this regarding the resolution pushed by Connor Wood?  Well, why would the City Attorney donate $250 to the Senate campaign of Conor Wood's wife? Because he wanted to see Jackson represented by the first bisexual individual in the Senate? No, of course not.  As the top general on team Dobies, Connor Wood ran the election commission with the city attorney and city clerk wanting to main their current jobs. When Connor Wood would ask them to jump, they would ask how high. That was true not just of the move to even your elections, but the gerrymandering of the city wards.  I see Kenwood turning his resignation, which makes sense because his work on behalf of Team Dobitz is done, certainly until the 2030s. Nationally, there was the shooting at the Christian School within the last couple weeks. The shooter was a woman claiming to be a man. The mainstream left media and the political left  have been trying to make out that it's transsexuals that are the victims. The shooting was followed up by what could be described as insurrections at state capitals, including Tennessee's. The white woman of the Tennessee 3 in order to save her position mentioned the two young black community organizers expelled had been using bullhorns and other tactics she did not deploy.  Then after having her position saved by one vote, immediately mentioned to the two that took much more extreme tactics that it must be racist and that they're treated differently. All three should have expelled for their illegal behavior. Then there was the United States Vice President that went to Tennessee to do some consoling, not to the shooting victims' families, but to the insurrectionists.

First of all, this is our 40th anniversary year. Yay, very exciting. And the second thing is that Jackson has been selected by the Balloon Federation of America to host the Women's Nationals competition this year, which means the week before our festival,  we'll have the top 15 women pilots flying here in Jackson competing to go to the World's Competition. It's a one-year contract that's renewable up to three years. Very excited about it. My favorite thing right now is that we've already filled the slot. There were a total of 15 slots available, completely full, and we actually have five pilots on the waiting list in case anybody drops out, which is the most pilots they've ever had compete in the Women's Nationals Competition, so...

He was willing to meet with us and I just wanted to thank him. He was very approachable and helpful. We didn't solve all the city's problems but  I did want to say that he was wonderful to talk with and helpful in answering a lot of our questions. So I just wanted to publicly thank him. I secondly wanted to let you all know that I don't know what your procedures are, but I have applied for an open position to serve on the City Council Board.  I would like to make an appeal for you to approve my application in spite of our, I'm sure there's a lot of you that we have disagreements on some things.  and some policies but I believe there is a need for input from many conservatives in our city and that I would like to be able to do that and serve in that fashion. I would be faithful in attending and diligent in working towards bettering Jackson. That has been always been my goal to do what's right  and to do what I can to help better Jackson, my hometown. So I also, since I have a few more seconds, I did want to just make this comment since this was brought up. Guns aren't the problem. Wicked people with guns or other weapons are the problem. We need to stand against attempts to restrict gun ownership  to people who are wise and safe and responsible with guns. And also support attempts to prosecute and deter evil and help those evil problems not take away and restrict good gun ownership. People, good people with guns helped stop, deter crime.

First, Mr. Mayor, last time I asked you to explain where you disagree with Keisha Hamilton, you complimented the city clerk on her African American mask and accessories and some other things, but forgot to answer my question. If you could write down a reminder right now and answer the question during certain council member comments, it would be great.  If you also would explain what your non-profit or non-profits are and what they do and what other non-profits and organizations they closely work with, that would be great, too. Speaking of Keisha Hamilton, she and the Racist Equity Commission want to see that measurable outcomes, or in other words, quotas, are achieved in purchasing.  The city should be looking at how to get the best product or service at the best price. The quota suggested we'll see that is not done and hit and as and as has been mentioned are illegal. Mention of April of 2018 being the last time the manual was revised, uh, was mentioned, which refers to the early reign of Derek Dobie's as mayor.  The suggested changes to the policy manual are just the ramping up of those politics. Speaking of these politics of race, Joe Biden in the last few days met with the Tennessee 3 insurrectionists. It came out that one of the expelled ones was with others blocking the streets in 2020 and then used a traffic cone to assault a driver that had stopped. The leftist prosecutor refused to see if he faced justice in court.  The other of the two turns out to have been a preppy in college six years ago, but recently has taken on the persona of a 1960s activist with a large afro. While the mainstream media has been the enemy of the truth on that, they've also been so on the shootings of people going on someone else's property.  They played up the young black man shot by a white 84-year-old man and that could only have been racism but they didn't play up others such as the black man that shot a 6-year-old white girl trying to retrieve her basketball. A stat I heard mentioned in the last week was that of all the murders according to FBI statistics in which it was a black  in white perpetrator and victim. 84 percent of the time the perpetrator was black, far from what the media tries to portray. I suppose it's the same politics in which you see the final report from the final report from residents in action, which was on this agenda originally, has now been taken off.  There is no data available online. As I mentioned, Rhea's so-called homeless efforts were a big con job in order to have access to a cash grab of the city's ARPA funding.

I support the revisions as proposed here and ask this body to approve the revisions.  Approving these revisions will provide opportunities for contractors who have previously been prevented from participating completely in the bidding process.

We can all agree that the City of Jackson should not punish interracial marriages. In the revision to the City of Jackson Purchasing Policy Manual, a disadvantaged business enterprise, or DBE, is defined as a local business where 51% is owned by a minority person or group.  This discriminates against a business owned jointly by an interracial couple, where each owns 50%. This is wrong. Section 3.2.C in the purchasing agreement lists the responsibility of the purchasing agent to buy without prejudice, conduct all transactions on a strictly ethical basis,  Avoid all forms of commercial bribery and legal entanglements. Yet section 3.2.J sets a purchasing contract award ratio for each such group as at least 20% for minority business enterprises and women business enterprises.  I can't tell whether that means 40% for the two groups or whether it's 20% for the whole thing. Section 7.7.A gives the city council authority to reject any and all bids and to accept other than the lowest responsive bid after review of bidders DBE, MBE, or WEB status.  And in section 16.1, tie bids are awarded by evaluating the services based on factors addressing equity and ownership. And as you have already heard, the Michigan State Constitution gives equal protection. And on discrimination, it says, no person shall be denied the equal protection of laws, nor shall any person be denied  the enjoyment of his civil or political rights or be discriminated against in the exercise thereof because of religion, race, color, or national origin. Clearly, the revisions to the purchasing policy manual are designed to discriminate against businesses owned by white or pink-skinned people.

And when I walked out of City Hall that evening, guess what happened next? I was personally handled right in front of the building that night, two weeks ago tonight. If you do not see the accelerating rot and  In this city, both physical and ethical, you are willfully blind. So this council's entertaining a proposal tonight from the City Racial Envy Commission to radically overturn the city's purchasing practices and create new race and sex-based standards and quotas. Let's do a very quick run through of this measure. Section 3.2J says there will be 20% purchase contract quotas each set aside for women and minorities. That is highly illegal under state and federal law.  Section 3.20, subsection 10, the purchasing agent must use the race and sex of the bidder in judging the bid. That is illegal under Michigan law. Section 6.2D, the contract will be awarded, check this out, will be awarded to the lowest responsive and responsible bidder only after the review of the bidder's race and sex and other status. Section 7, they're playing around with the sealed bids process. Color me surprised.  Section 77A, the city council has the authority to accept or recommend the acceptance of other than the lowest response of bid after a review of the bidder's DBE or MBE, i.e. race or sex status. So the race or sex of the bidder will trump the actual quality of the bid.  This is what the proposal says. What does the Michigan State Constitution say about all this? What does state civil rights law say specifically about contracting? Article 1, section 26 of the Michigan Constitution states, the state shall not discriminate against or grant preferential treatment to any individual or group on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin.  in public contracting. It's right there, it's not gray area, it's black and white. Not only is this the law in Michigan, this specific statute was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2014. This proposal is 100% illegal and will result in a richly deserved onslaught  of lawsuits against the city of Jackson. This will be the biggest legal debacle in city history. Whatever individual opinion anyone on this body or in this room might have about this language does not, cannot, and will not contravene Michigan civil rights law and the Michigan Constitution. City law does not trump  the Michigan constitution. That's ludicrous.

I think you're going to have some businesses that could band together and could be upset. I'm afraid that the city could end up maybe getting even sued.

Jennifer Bittinger and I am really grateful to the city council members who questioned the proposed amendments last last meeting to our purchasing policies and procedures. I have attended a number of racial equity meetings and have never heard of their proposals regarding these changes which unfortunately leads me to believe that it was a secret attempt to pass it through public or without public awareness.  The REC claims that this is desired by the community. Very slanted. This equity framework is not desired by large amounts of the constituents and only those that are deceived by and support the policies of CRT are trying to slip it into our government practices. CRT is anti-American. America is about freedom, individual equality, not group equity, and not equal outcomes, which is similar to communism and Marxism.  CRT believes that your skin color defines your ability to succeed. This is a lie from the elites that want to control and divide our country, not to mention destroy our beliefs that God created all men equal. I have such compassion for our children who are bombarded with destructive ideas that they must suffer with intergenerational guilt and are limited by their race, sex, or disadvantages. That is certainly not God's plan and not according to our state and national constitutions.  Do we want to stand for injustices and oppose racism? Yes, but the solution is not to divide us into groups and mandate certain privileges to any particular group. I myself am only a part of one of these groups and it is offensive to me to be considered socially and economically disadvantaged. God made me a woman and I'm thankful. I shouldn't be given an advantage of a purchasing contract simply for that reason and no man should be denied.  It is a slap in the face to Martin Luther King's dream and all that he stood for not to be judged by the color of their skin or in my case my gender but by the content of their character. Also have you heard our state constitution does say that we cannot grant preferential treatment to based on race, sex, etc. in the operation of public contracting. Does this not clearly show the problems with these attempts to give preferential treatment?  And as far as the additions throughout the purchasing manual, it is very confusing as to what it means after review of the bidder status. Very subjective and unclear. And what kind of governmental control will be given to this NMSDC after being written into the manual? Changes are only an attempt to install CRT into our city government and we need to stop it.  We already have written into section 3.2c the purchasing agent is to buy without prejudice. Please do not contribute to the wicked CRT agenda to incite race warfare name calling and intimidation.

And first of all, as a black person, if I were Keisha, I'd be embarrassed. It's a disgrace as a black person to suggest that a minority would need to be given preferential treatment in order to receive what should be coming to them by merit.  Isn't this a knock to the people of color and minorities to say that unless you give us preferential treatment, we're not able to compete with others. We are less than them and we need to have special favors. You see, the whole thing behind equity  is that equity takes away opportunity and resources from others. It's actually redistribution for the unachievable promise of equal outcome for all. Although it promises utopia, it ignores personal agency and effort while dismantling the foundations of our society, which made our nation exceptional.  Equality is a tenet of racial justice efforts and critical race theory and leads us down the road to socialism. Equity jeopardizes liberty. We believe in equal opportunity.  over equal outcome. Equality, meaning equality of opportunity, is a human right outlined in the Declaration of Independence, which guarantees our own alienable rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. We are a nation of overcomers with countless real-life stories, those who have risen above adversity to create the impossible.

Um, the lead service project, we submitted a bid on that. I was here for the public opening of that. Um, there were three line items that were supposed to be read off at the public opening. It was supposed to be a,  overall bid price for the whole project. It was supposed to be a per unit price and a service price. They read ours first. Everything was just the way it was supposed to be. The second bid who was the low bidder. Um, they only read the per unit price and the hourly rate price for service. Had there be a problem which could potentially happen. Um,  And I immediately questioned it. I just said, that sounded like an incomplete bid. There's three spots on that bid form where they were supposed to fill in the full price amount. And then the last spot, they're actually supposed to hand write that on the second page. And I don't believe any of that was done, because when I called them on it, everybody kind of looked at each other and just proceeded, and I dropped it.  But I just want to make you guys aware of it. I believe it was an incomplete, non-compliant bid. And even though their overall price per unit may have been cheaper, our service rate was $20 an hour cheaper than what theirs was. And if you guys would look into that, I would appreciate it. I immediately thought it would get thrown out when I was in the room. And it didn't happen. And it just intrigued me.  So that's the only issue I have. I appreciate you guys listening. Thank you.",Governance and Civic Engagement

I'm here to discuss taxation without representation. This is not something this board can address. I'm talking specifically about the Jackson County Intermediate School Board. First of all, it doesn't reflect the makeup of Jackson County. The taxpayers  who pay the taxes for the ISD have no say as to who sits on that board. The city collects the taxes for the ISD, yet as taxpayers, we have no right to vote on the governing body. That is taxation without representation, which is against the Constitution.  Each taxpayer has the right to elect boards for schools, cities, townships, villages, the county, but not the ISD. The ISD board is selected by the county school boards. Each school has one vote, except for JPS, who has two votes because of the population of their students. Better than 40% of my taxes  that I pay to the city goes directly to the ISD. Yet I have no say who sits on that board, and you as taxpayers have no say who sits on that board. Under the Constitution, this is a miscarriage of justice, and we have to remember our history, the Boston Tea Party.  It is understood collecting taxes is essential to maintain the function of the ISD. I don't begrudge them that. I fail to see how we as taxpayers are rightfully represented. I have had this conversation with Kathy Schmultz. It is the state legislature that oversees the ISD and  The state legislature has not addressed this since 1976. They do not follow Robert's rules of law. There is no diversity on the board. It is made up of five people, one woman and four old white men.

Just a few hours ago, a jury found what anyone else should know, that President Trump didn't rape the lying famed seeker in New York. President Trump wasn't the only famous man. She lied about raping her.  Unfortunately, the jury decided that they didn't like President Trump or the things he said, so they awarded her $5 million. Politics shouldn't play a part in courts, but that is what happened in the New York courtroom this afternoon. This is what the Democrat Party is hoping for. Courts and juries in left-wing areas playing politics.  The attorney for the man that recently died on a subway when being restrained by three individuals said he was a loving man. That must include when that man beat up a 67-year-old woman, breaking her nose and fracturing her orbital bone. Not to mention over 40 other times police had to be called because of him.  His threats forced the individuals that restrained him to do so. While this incident became breaking news, so did an Atlanta shooting in which a black man murdered a white nurse and shot others at a hospital. The media didn't want to mention the race of the individuals involved in that incident, and it quickly faded from their reporting.  The New York subway incident has just gained political steam. This is just the disgusting politics, the mainstream media, and the political left. Then there's the mass shooting in Texas Saturday. The media didn't seem to come out with information on the shooter for at least a day until finally they decided to push the narrative that the shooter was a white supremacist. This is about a person with a name that would require someone like the city clerk who is proficient in pronouncing  Hispanic names to pronounce, and has parents that need a translator. Meanwhile, the manifesto of the woman claiming to be a man that murdered three children and three adults at a Christian school still is being withheld, presumably so the public won't know why she did it.  It's the same politics of race that gets us to residents and action report. There is no accounting on how they've spent funds in the final report. We're told in December it was found 50, there was 50-50 among blacks and whites in the homeless count, but their numbers in the report show drastically different numbers.

At the beginning, I just want to comment on Mr. Green's remarks about the water rates. He said we have no choice. That may well be the case, but I don't think anyone on this board can say we have no choice until we pull Kathy Schmaltz, Jonathan Lindsay, Sue Schenk, and others into this room, as Mr. Wilson suggested, and directly petition the state to see if we can get some relief.  It certainly can't hurt to ask. So, moving on to my main remarks, I would like to begin by commending Mr. Peter Bormuth's outstanding public comment at the last council meeting concerning the gross abuse  of the City Election Commission, which allowed the very well politically connected Connor Wood to redistrict Laura Dwyer Schlecte out of her seat in the fourth ward, which he has now proceeded to run for himself. A brazen abuse of power is what Peter called it, and I concur, and every civic-minded person I've spoken to about this disgusting act concurs as well.  The question I have for this body is why do you not concur? A sleazy political hit job was just carried out by the Election Commission, yet you seem to have nothing to say about that. Where's your due diligence? Where's your basic decency? Speaking of the City Election Commission, it's gone. MIA. Missing in action.  Don't take my word for it, take a look on the city website. There's 18 separate boards, councils, and commissions are listed, but take a look right between the DDA and Ellis Sharp Park Board and what do you see? Nothing. All references to the election commission have been scrubbed from the city site. Now take a look on the agendas and minutes page for the various commissions. It's been deleted from there as well. Every agenda, all the minutes for the elections commission. Gone, baby, gone. Mr. Mayor,  Mr. Green, Mr. Haggerty and members of council, you are breaking the law and you are in flagrant violation of the Michigan Open Meetings Act of 1976 by removing those agendas and minutes from public view. I suspect those agendas and minutes are being poured over on Connor Woods laptop as I speak so they can be selectively edited for public consumption at a future date convenient to him.  This is election interference, and since Connor Wood lacks the personal authority to remove public information from the city website, this strongly suggests conspiracy and collusion to commit election fraud.  In addition to public records being illegally removed from the city website, Mr. Wood has deleted all reference to his selfless service on the Election Commission from his LinkedIn page and has also completely deleted his Twitter page. He'd like the public to think he never heard of, let alone served on, the Election Commission, a true man of the people. Note to Conor Wood, the internet is forever.",Governance and Civic Engagement

The intention of our city commission is to double dip monies obtained by Jackson, Michigan residents for the water and the sewer rates.  first by taxation, then by the planning, then by planning to submit to the government for subsidies, which would pay for these services without ever taxing the residents. Mahoney is not concerned with that at all. Mahoney blatantly stated this on live TV, April 25th at the 2023 city commission meeting.  Double dipping is our concern.

The first was there was a lot of maintenance that was put off and a lot of remodeling, a lot of new equipment that was needed that was put off for a long time.  Secondly, there was the Flint water crisis and the state's unfunded mandate to require you to replace all your lead service lines. The third thing, of course, was consumers' withdrawal from the system. And the fourth thing is inflation. You know, among those things, what you can control is  There's still currently the ability to get more grant funding from the state, and I'd certainly like to see that, um, to take some of this burden off our taxpayers. I'm also, uh, now engaged in litigation that I hope will bring consumers back to the system. I can't guarantee victories, of course, but, uh, I have a very good, strong legal position. Um, I also wanted to deal with some other issues that are here before Council. Um, number one, Connor Wood,  was on our election commission, and he designed the map that council approved, five to two, and that map moved Laura Schlecte out of the fourth ward. And there's nothing wrong with that. I mean, maps have to be drawn every 10 years according to the census. But now we discovered that Connor Wood is running in the fourth ward. And this is called malfeasance.  Um, my council member, Freddie Dancy doesn't see anything wrong with this, but I think that when people pursue self interest instead of city interest, that there's a problem and there should be penalties. Um, Connor would still sits on our environmental commission and our planning commission. And I believe council should remove him from those positions for this malfeasance and this conflict of interest that he engaged in. Um, there's a, uh,  consent item to appoint to the historical commission Maurice Imhoff and two other people. Maurice is a young man who threatened to shoot up his school when he was 16 or 15 and at the same time threatened  to blackmail a fellow student at the school with compromising pictures that he had taken of her. For some reason, Derek Dobies and Connor Wood decided he was a good person to run for the state legislature. I think the young man needs a cooling off period.

I've lived in the City of Jackson for exactly 20 years this year. Our water bills used to be low and very predictable. They'd be around $75 every single quarter. But since 2016, all six categories that go into the calculation of the bills have increased between 64% and 74%. Our latest bill was $180.  Now, your new budget is proposing a rate increase of 63% on top of that by 2027. That was on page 21 of the Baker Tilly slideshow, which was conveniently not shown during tonight's presentation. Jackson cannot afford this. You all can do better with state and federal funding. Detroit was able to get 90%, which was $90 million from the state and federal grants.

So we have all heard of the Flint water crisis which was caused by an incompetent city council  which introduced untreated river water into the local water supply. So many, many people are here tonight because of what is now the Jackson Water Crisis. The Jackson Water Crisis involves abusing the citizens of Jackson with back-breaking water rate increases that will leave thousands of people in this town, the working poor and retirees on fixed income especially, having to choose between food, prescription drugs, and water to drink, cook, and bathe with.  This crisis is also the result of extremely poor decision-making on the part of this Council Mayor and Manager. During the last seven years, water rates have already been raised and eye-watering 73%, with rate increases happening every single year. According to a news story from 2021, 2,000 Jackson households were already seriously struggling to pay their water bills. On May 10th, just two weeks ago, Mayor Daniel Mahoney said in a news interview on 970 AM,  but our water rates, I believe, for a good seven to 10 years had no increases at all. Does anyone here believe for a single minute that the mayor of Jackson is unaware that the very opposite is true? Had the mayor answered truthfully, as thousands listened, that the city is planning another 63% of rent increases on top of the 73% of rate increases between 2015 and 2022, there would be hundreds more people here tonight.  It is certainly true that the state has mandated expensive lead line replacement, but that does not justify the endless rate increases on the backs of the people of Jackson. The city received a once in a lifetime gift from the federal government in American Rescue or ARPA funds, but chose to spend $2.5 million of that to build a professional kitchen in the old Masonic building to train, we were told, at risk youth to work in restaurants. The thing is, if you just walk a single mile,  to the MLK Center, there is a brand new commercial kitchen that was built just a few years ago that could be used for this very purpose. There is literally no need and no justification for this wasteful spending, but every city council member and the mayor voted to squander these millions rather than applying them to water improvements, knowing they would stick the homeowners and taxpayers with the bill. The city cries poor when it comes to upgrading the water system, yet we'll have dumped 4.6 million of your dollars into the Masonic Temple project when all is said and done.  The city needs to enact a two-year moratorium on all water and sewer rate increases tonight, and that is just the first step. There are many others. I strongly urge you to vote to freeze water rates immediately because I am certain that a majority of City Council is on the brink of getting voted out this fall or recalled by righteously angry voters.

And at least a few occasions during conversations with me, I have had people call my council member Karen, but now words criticizing her intellect, certainly in regards to her out of touch comment about for going coffee a few times a month to did miss.  to dismiss people's concerns about what will be water and sewer rate hikes in the several hundreds of dollars a year expected during her time on the City Council reaffirms those criticisms. I was especially irked by Karen Bunnell's gobbling up all the copies of a law passed out by a commenter to make sure the City Council was informed on the law a few City Council meetings ago.  and a matter they would be voting on. It has always been the practice, citizens pass out copies of information to all the council members and appointed officials if they wanted to. Refusing to accept the information or not allowing other council members to see it and something related to what they're going to be voting on shortly after,  was not particularly smart. Combine that with Karen Bunnell deciding to stop allowing people to send their comments in while we're still in the throes of the pandemic seems to suggest she might not give a flying bleep about what people in the city think. While she may be able to afford the cost of a few coffees or or more a month, many in the city that will be having  will have trouble affording the several hundred of dollars a year, wouldn't even think to consistently go to places where you pay $4.50 for coffee.  I know the city's been having this, the call 211, so I think they understand there are people that have trouble paying bills. Attending Laura Schlecting's meeting last night, city staff gave a presentation on water and sewer systems in the city and what will be likely passing by this council of rate hikes for the next two years. I brought up the large  rate hikes proposed by Baker Tilly for the years after that. Staff assured the group they would do everything possible to reduce past possible  rate hikes. I mentioned a lot of things were out of their control. Things weren't out of the control of the majority of this council when Consumers Energy was allowed to get out of the old Karen Morgan plant contract, nor was it out of the control of individual members of this council in November of 2020 to prevent Biden inflation.

I was here when mayor was commenting or several on here, I believe was commenting on, and I heard him speak about no increases in the past seven to 10 years on the water rates. And I took that as fact. Unfortunately, I have since learned about all the different types of charges that are calculated into our home water bill. And in fact,  There are six separate charges that I found out that have increased since 2015, which was the statement that you made. And that just totally that you made, I'm sorry. Anyway, I heard it here, but I thought I heard you were on some radio broadcast saying the same thing. So anyway,  This is not truth. If you are saying that there's been no water increases, that's what upsets me and that's what I'm here for because I'm all about truth. I want the people to know, everybody needs to know, but on top of that I just wanted to say that I know these increases are not a large amount but in these inflationary times every dollar helps. Most government job holders don't even blink  at these increases because they keep giving themselves raises. But for the average Joe public, it is yet another way the government is raiding their wallets. And then for us landlords, we have to pass this on to already struggling tenants. And with Jackson consistently losing its population, we need to be finding ways to downsize government, downsize government spending, decrease taxes, and start stimulating our businesses.  But most importantly was the fact that we need to be truthful in all that we say and do and I thought that was very misleading. And on top of that I wanted to read this real quick because I stumbled across this to encourage believers about our Michigan Constitution. We the people of the state of Michigan  Grateful to almighty God for the blessings of freedom and earnestly desiring to secure these blessings undiminished to ourselves and our posterity to ordain and establish this constitution.

I'm very thankful for the DPW leadership for working so hard to obtain these funds.  and to, and, uh, not placing capital improvements on the shelf as has been, has occurred in the past because larger cities have received large sums to complete the changes needed in lead pipes and capital improvements over smaller towns. I again applaud the DPW for working, uh, for peck using pecks for service lines and pushing the envelope to get grants, et cetera.  Now, we need to look at increases that people can't afford. Even if there are assistance programs that are out there, we all know that most of this goes to homelessness, etc. That's a big problem. I understand that.  I wonder where you think people are going to get this money to pay their taxes, their water bills, how are they going to eat and keep their houses? Maybe the city will have to repo them because they're not paying their taxes.  And that would help the city with their housing needs. Uh, we need to also take another look at the overall city budget with police fire and DPW off of the table. They're not affected. Maybe we should take a look at 5% cuts and all other departments, uh, cut the $2 million test kitchen, which we do not need.

Do you know how many times we hear that as taxpayers?  that argument only every time the city, county, library, jail, ISD, local school districts, dog catcher ask for taxpayers money.  While I am not a resident of the city of Jackson, my life is impacted by decisions that are made by this city council and city management. The majority of my, uh, purchases and, and, um, goods of serving goods and services is in the city or the immediate vicinity. Jackson is a beautiful city, but it's not a wealthy city. The cost of homes has risen, which is great for the seller. Not so great for the purchaser when they get their tax bill.  Looking at census data, the population has declined 7% since 2010, and my fear is the increasing cost to reside in the city, such as water and sewage rate increases, will be detrimental to growth in new business as well as population. While challenging, I ask that city management and you as city council look to fiscally responsible policies to preserve the current population  contribute to an increase in the tax paying population of the city and not continue to burden city residents with tax or with increases.

There's many, many individuals that are making a good living with this and paying taxes on their income, and going to a single hauler would be a mistake.  The water rates we saw increase not that long ago, and they will continue to increase as they did seven years past for several years in the future. And as it was mentioned, water rates are getting outrageous.  in the city. And the ward rezoning, I think that's another point that we should take into consideration.

The 100 Homes Program is a nice concept, but this should be planned and approved by the people of Jackson. Yes, I'm aware that there are six people here on the council who are supposed to represent the people, but I don't see that with any of their past actions. The ARPA funds can be used for roads and water systems, we know.  New houses need smooth roads, none of which is evident in Jackson. Examples being Waterloo, Bennett, Bacchus, South Bowen, Commonwealth, Monroe, South Jackson, just to name a few. If these streets are not going to have water lines replaced, then they need to be resurfaced. Jackson's water system can be improved at a decreased cost to citizens other than the $15.4 million  from the ARPA fund already allotted, allocated, excuse me, to the fund. It is great to have new homes, but we have houses more easily affordable in Jackson rather than isolated new homes within  an area of old houses that aren't worth as much. How about looking into senior 65 and older condos that free up single family homes? This may require tearing down some more of the older homes in the neighborhoods to decrease the exodus of seniors moving out of Jackson to Blackmon and some townships or out of the area completely.  plus condos 65 and older will maintain a tax base. If it is, it is long past time to reinvent Jackson. We need to look at Jackson as a whole, not at only a few. The city, the mayor, the city council work members work for the citizens of Jackson, not independent or NGOs and nonprofits.  What is the plan to replace water lines? Let's see our 10-year plan. How many lines have been replaced to date? What is the timeline of the following funding from the state?  The 591 Fund of $1.35 million. The 402 Capital Improvement Fund of $18.3 million. The grant money, which according to MLive and the Jackson Citizen Patriot was $9 million. And a questionable Capital Improvement Fund of $65 million and another fund unnamed of $28 million.

So I am, my name is Sheila and I'm with the Greater Jackson Habitat for Humanities. I'm the executive director and I'm here to talk about the hundred homes. I love the concept of bringing new homes, affordable homes to our community and the longevity of having homes in our, in our community is way overdue. A lot of our homes in our community is well over 80 years old.  The one thing that I am opposing is the non-profit RFP. There are some things in there that I made very clear that non-profit organizations need to make money.  They need to be able to at least cover their costs. And when the first 100 homes came about, because of our expertise in our nonprofit organization, we know that it will take time to find qualified applicants. So we took upon ourselves at Greater Habitat to try to jumpstart this. And in the month of May, we had 31 applicants come in. That cost my organization $6,000 to do.  And moving forward to be able to apply for this RFP, there has to be some money in there for us.  to be able to cover our costs, to be able to fulfill our mission of having safe, affordable homes. On top of that, there are fees that are just hard-cost fees to the title company. And maybe some of you guys don't know that when someone sells a home, such as the builder, the builder is going to have about $3,100 of hard costs when they sell that home to us as a nonprofit organization. And we're going to have a hard cost of about $2,700 to $2,900.  to purchase that house to sell to a new homeowner. Then when we sell it to the new homeowner, we've got another $2,900 of just hard costs that's just closing, just in our closing fees.  So I'm asking you guys to look at this a little bit closer and to see how the builders are going to get some money. The community is going to be able to get some money for down payment. Just asking for us to re-look at this to see if there's some money for our organization if we apply. Also, Community Action Agency would love to apply for this, too. We both have a great passion to be able to bring some affordable homes into our community. And I think this is a great opportunity.  We just need to find the right numbers that makes us a win-win for everybody. Um, I think that's it. I didn't even write anything down, but that's just from the top of my head.

Regarding homelessness and the residents in action con, the agenda packet has the statement that the city is perfectly situated to bring all the stakeholders together. That is false. As I've said all along, the city is not, was not and is not designed to lead or be significantly involved in homelessness efforts. Residents in action took credit for doing way more than they were asked to do.  Apples to oranges comparisons were used to do this while the other two entities that bid on the homelessness project did so by using 30 days in 25 rooms. We had used 100 or so days to come up with numbers. Because of people being kicked out of motels and other coming and going numbers like 86 stated was not above and beyond anything that could have been expected.  Besides the problems I mentioned previously, in the final report I saw that just one of the two motels used charged the city for damage in 19 rooms.

In case anyone is wondering, and everyone here probably should be,  The actual income criteria for this program based on AMI is $46,000 at the low end for a family of four and $61,350 at the high end. So with the purchase assistance factored in, mortgage plus taxes, mortgage payment plus taxes plus insurance will probably run something like $1,100 a month.  So it's going to take iron discipline for a family of four with $3,000 and probably even less in take-home income to consistently make their payments. They will also be paying close to $100 a month for water in a few years' time, given the recent increases and projected increases. I base that off my own water bill and with a family of four. I'm going to be paying a little under $1,200 a year by the time  the projected increases are all facing by 2027. That's a lot of money. It's a lot more than a cup of coffee. I would just add an explicit ban on cash out refi for the $37,000 earnest money needs to be written into this city language for at least five years. $37,000 is a lot of money to every person in this room, but especially so for modest or low earners struggling to make ends meet.

That raised rent for everybody approximately $250 a month. And it also took a lot of property away from the people. And the new buildings were all apartment complexes, and they are investor-owned, of course. So this 100 Home Project gives individuals the opportunity to invest in a new home with a certain amount  the mortgage being paid in other places. And we have builders who are going to do it.

And this is the second year I've been after it, spoke with Jonathan beforehand, and probably won't happen till next year. But I want to put it on your agenda and ideas. Also, up by the roundhouse, the rotunda in Ellis Sharp Park, they left the area unmowed under the spruce trees, which was a very good idea, because woodchucks live there. And it gives the young woodchucks  some additional cover, you know, keeps them safe from the coyotes, from the hawk. And now, all of a sudden, in the middle of the summer, when the burdock was growing there and, you know, the woodchucks eat those roots, they love that plant, they've mowed it all down. What for? It doesn't look any better than it did when that stuff was growing. Whose idea was that? You know, just really tired of some of these ideas that I see in our  public spaces.

Uh, that's a going to be a small family business. I'm looking forward to being the first Jackson city resident to open one.  And a little bit of background on the microbusiness for those of you that don't know. It's much smaller, much like a microbrewery. So we're only allowed to have 150 plants. Everything that we sell will be made or grown on site. So we will not sell through, oh, we won't sell any products from any other grower. So again, just like a microbrewery.  Let's see everything our motto is seed to shelf again. Just we're kind of the I guess the anti Establishment marijuana business in that we we say that we farm we don't manufacture. So again, everything is hand done Part of our part of our idea was to be  a little more anonymous, a little out of the way, which even selecting our location on South Street provides some anonymity for our clients. I think a lot of people want to experience, whether it's the physiological relief or  you know, to help them sleep, but they don't want to be seen going into a, you know, your typical dispensary with the lights in them, whether it's music. I've been to several and I myself actually feel uncomfortable walking into some of them. So we don't want any, any of that. The loud, we're not Cheech and Chong.

So tonight, I'm doing that, but I'm also here to sort of bring some good news and some updates about what's going on with the Senator's office. In July and August, the lawmakers are not in lawmaking session any longer.  a lot of other things. So I wanted to say that you may see us on the streets of Jackson. We were out yesterday and today. We've got several young people, summer interns, working for the office as well. And we're out, it's called  legislative canvassing, the fancy term, but it's just a way for the senator and other legislators who are doing this to just get out in the public, the people who they represent, who they work for, and ask what issues are the most important to you.  We have heard Rhodes for an answer to speak to what council member Schlecte said but just asking them honestly what is important to them right now and what they want Lansing to be working on going forward. So we're doing that so if you see us maybe open your door to us and give us two minutes of your time.  So that's exciting. And then the good news is that the senator and her team were able to secure, in the most recent state budget that was just passed, I believe $1 million for the Jackson Housing Commission's affordable housing project.

Well, there's a first tonight. You voted in opposition, you all voted no on street assessments. My goodness, I've been coming to these meetings for years, watching them on TV for years, and it's always a rubber stamp approval to assess the property owner, east side, west side, north side, south side.  Fixed income, high income, it doesn't matter. You would think it would be, you know, maybe it's an election year or something. And there's some pandering going on here. Because you, Lord Dwyer Schlecte, has never voted an assessment down. Never. Why tonight? We have the petitions. That's a good thing. And these people filed a petition,  and they had their street. Their street is no longer going to be reconstructed. And they're not going to be assessed the thousands and thousands of dollars unnecessarily. There's plenty of money in the city's water enterprise fund, the city's sewer enterprise fund, a reserve fund of $9 million, $32 million you received from the federal government two years ago,  Can any of that money be applied to lower these assessments? Is there any of that money left? We don't see it on the City Hall's website anymore. How much of that money is left? And where was it spent? Some of it was spent wisely to upgrade and change over some equipment at the DPW, water system, sewer systems. That's a good thing, the infrastructure.  Streets are infrastructure, too. That $32 million should have been used to lower assessments all these years. But it wasn't. Instead, we got the Masonic Temple, incubator kitchen, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

The same year Daniel Mahoney was elected mayor, he was awarded with a job at the Michigan AFL-CIO. Like Colleen Sullivan, Connor Wood, and Kelsey Hackwood before him, and like Maurice Imhoff last year, who was given a paid position at the AFL-CIO within weeks of becoming the Democrat candidate for state house. What a cozy, cozy club.  I'd smile if I had a job like that, too. All title, all salary, little responsibility.  After Mahoney became mayor, he nominated his old friend and boss at the AFL-CIO, Connor Wood, to sit on the City Elections Commission, where he redrew the maps in order to push the 4th Ward incumbent out of her own district, which Connor himself is now running for. God help us all if this sleazebucket is somehow elected from the 4th Ward.  At the very last meeting, Mayor Mahoney made an extraordinary effort, twisting arms and throwing his weight around to ensure that he had a personal say, a personal say.  In helping the highly disreputable Residents in Action get another bite of the sweet, sweet federal grant money, Jackson is trying to hustle to create a homeless campus in a residential neighborhood in Jackson. This is the same Residents in Action that pocketed $50,000, that's $1 in four,  to board some homeless people at a rat-trap motel that is a 24-hour-a-day open-air drug market, and then provided them with uncooked hot dogs and unopened canned food with no can openers to survive on. Nice oversight, city. So who is the big wheel behind the scenes at Residence in Action? I know you know this. I'm talking to the crowd here.  The one pulling strings but rarely appearing in public with the main schemers. Who is this person? None other than arch-racist and friend of Daniel, not just a friend of Daniel, but close personal ally and partner, Keisha Hamilton. Whiteness is evil, she said. White people are more dangerous than animals, and white women are the stupidest, quote the moronic Keisha. The head of the city racial equity commission.  She also refers to white people as whitey, but that's okay because she has a tight professional relationship with Daniel Mahoney. They are co-founders and co-chairs, isn't this, isn't this, tell me if I'm wrong, of yet another, no I'm not, no you're not, it's on your own campaign site, you're the co-founder and co-chair of another conniving local non-profit called Racing and Equity. You're denying what you say on your own website? Is that a fact?  How curious. Do any of you remember Daniel mentioning this close personal relationship with Keisha Hamblin when her race-baiting comments were a national news story? I sure don't. What's Keisha's philosophy when it comes to spending public money? I'm going to quote from her tweet from last month. Quote, when I say sign the blank check, I mean it.

My name is Sheila Everts and I'm the Executive Director of Greater Jackson Habitat. We're located at 251 West Prospect. I am here today to talk about the 100 homes. The City Council will vote on the City staff to facilitate the 100 homes.  Community Action Agency and Habitat joined together, as you guys heard earlier, in a joint effort to respond to the RFP that was released. We both have proven programs to serve under 80% AMI and below. However, the RFP exceeded the cost expectancy.  Therefore, we are not awarded nor allowed to discuss how we could be part of this program. Based on the information we have, it sounds like developers were offered the opportunity to negotiate options. We have served this community for 34 years and CA for over 50. We have a proven track record of providing affordable homes to our community.  which includes financial education, homebuyer education, and wraparound services. Toby spoke earlier about community action agency and these services also. In addition, Habitat has a few lenders that will give mortgages to these homeowners below market rate and lower credit scores.  During the past six months, I've worked closely with the city to assist and give my 20 years of experience on how we could facilitate this program. In addition, Habitat has received over 170 applications for this program at our own expense because we believed in this program. To achieve the 100 homes, approximately 2,000 applications will be needed, even though we're a non-profit, our costs should still be covered.  So before you vote tonight, I want you guys to consider some questions. Who is selling a lot to qualified homebuyers? Are the cities or the developers? Who's paying for closing costs with the title company? What is the budget cost for the city to facilitate this program? Who will do the financial education and homebuyer class? Will the homeowners pay for this, or will CAA, Community Action Agency, be expected to cover this cost and the increase in their class enrollment?  who represent the buyers for the purchases of these homes. The program is for 60 to 80% AMI. And for my opinion, 75 to 80% AMI will qualify currently, but have under 60 to 75% of AMI applicants will have to be eligible for layers of funding if they're not using a nonprofit organization. This comes to my last question.  Example of the property tax saving for the homeowners. As a non-profit, the law states that new homeowner property taxes is based on their mortgage amount and not on their sales price. So if someone was to have a mortgage of $150,000, their tax base is about $45,000. If it's $130,000, it's $3,300. $4,500. Yes. The beacon was getting to me. Thank you, Sheila. Maria.",Housing

I don't envy you for your work, but I admire you for your work. It is truly public servant work and I'm sure everyone here is doing the best they can and making the decisions they think are best for the community. So thank you for putting in the time and thank you for listening to me.  We were here several times regarding the Blackstone and another project, the Greenwood, helping to develop new, high quality, affordable housing in your community. Certainly those projects have been slightly delayed, mostly because of economic challenges and the cost inflation that we've experienced over the last three years. When we started the Blackstone,  to the time where we could construct the Blackstone. COVID-related inflation has brought an additional $3 million in cost to the development. So that has slowed us down a little bit. Never fret. We scratch and call and find ways to fill those gaps, and fortunately  We found those gaps now, so we are targeting a closing on what will be a 53-unit affordable housing development at the corner of Pearl and Blackstone. Those units will target up to 80% AMI. There's a variety of bandwidths in there, so we're about to serve the low- to moderate-income families in your community with a high-quality, brand-new house, home that will include anything and everything you would expect in your own home. They're built to green standards.  They're 100% accessible, so we're really excited about serving your community with that. Two pieces of legislation in front of you. First is a development agreement that assures we follow through on all the commitments that we've committed to the administration. The other is a purchase agreement, and it's essentially just an extension of the option we've already had, and we'll materialize that into a more formal contract for closing. We hope that will happen.  in early October. I'm sorry, September. September, early to mid-September is our goal. We have a lot of great partners in this and there's still a lot of work to do as we finalize the closing, but approving these two documents will set us up to be able to close on that pace.

So like, I wish Kyle Wabe would have stayed. But yeah, the reason why we can't use the bathrooms anymore is because they're being used for stuff that they're not supposed to be used for. Drug dealing, prostitution, people shitting up there. These policies, a lot of them were promoted previously by Derek Dobes, who's here right now.  As sort of a solution, needle programs as a solution to sort of decrease overdoses and to keep needles off the street and allow people to use, I guess, whatever addicted substances they're on in a more safe way. And the exact opposite of that is what is happening. The Reed Manor found an employee dead inside of one of the customer's apartments and the customer was dead too. They had both died from an overdose.  Derek Dobies is on the news smiling, holding, or shaking somebody's hand to install a needle program on the Reed Manor property. Previously, the homeless shelter was used to sort of pilot the needle programs and not rocket have skyrocketed since then. Almost all of the 911 calls in Jackson County are in the city. And of the calls in the city, a majority of them go to nonprofit organizations.  for things like overdoses, drug dealing, labor weapons, sex, drug trafficking. These are important issues and a lot of this stuff, you know, the Republican Party many years ago attempted to address this through sort of a legal way to change the way that businesses in America could operate and installing sort of a  safer business practices, ending things like obviously human trafficking as a priority. Right here in Jackson, I see that the MLK Corridor Improvement Authority is using this to sort of market itself, the history of the Republican Party, but Jackson didn't really stick to that path of trying to protect consumers from bad business practices. Things like these needle programs are a bad business practice. They don't work.  And Kyle was totally right to be upset that he's paying money for part of the park, which he can't use for his event. And a lot of people have questions about why we can't use these things. But, I mean, we really should be addressing, like, what are the ideas that are being promoted to city council members or political parties or non-profit organizations in Jackson?  Are they actually good ideas? And are they legitimate? Is what they're saying true? So like Community Action Agency, they get $25 million a year in funding. They do have enough money, and it is their job that they have chosen to take on to address things like homeowner education, things like that.

We've had three all year.  Now, gun violence is difficult for the police. They come, as you notice after you read, after it has happened or while it is ongoing. They are not there beforehand. They cannot take these guns away from people beforehand because of both our Constitution and the stupidity of our legislators and Congress who have not dealt with this issue. That's all I have to say on that. I want to talk about  some other things. Patrick Birch was raised. Patrick Birch and Derek Dobies demolished almost 1,500 homes in Jackson. Freddie, you voted for every one of those demolitions. Those demolished homes were the housing that the poor people who are now, you know, you're building affordable housing, one of the mayor's initiatives, you're taking care of the homeless. Well, where do you think  happened to the affordable housing. You tore it down, Freddie, and you were on the board of realtors at the time. And I think you're also on  the Chamber of Commerce Executive Board. And the Chamber of Commerce, Jackson was the only Chamber of Commerce I know that did not support marijuana development. And Freddie is the one who's opposed to marijuana development. Now, the only township got $500,000 kickback from the state in their taxes. That could be used toward your assessments.  That would be another pool. That was jobs that would have been available to the people on the east side. That whole east Michigan Avenue, you go to another city and you'll see four, five, six of the old buildings remodeled, refurnished, and their marijuana dispensaries or other marijuana related industries. So Freddie, you've been an impediment  And you've created the problems we're facing and then I go to a meeting of the Homeless Council and I hear that we're going to deal with the homeless from November 1st to March 31st.  I'm telling you, Freddie, homeless people, the problems they face on the street don't start on November 1st, and they don't end on March 31st. I would like the city to address this year-wide problem. I have to go down to Consumers Park, I have to call the police chief four or five times in that two-week period to remove homeless people who are living there.  That is public property.

I have this mask stuck in my hair. Our address is 1214 Greenwood Avenue. I am here about item 1111, the change in the program guidelines for the 100 homes program. In  The memo from the city staff, they identified one non-profit submission on the RFP. That was us, Community Action Agency. We submitted it in partnership with Habitat for Humanity. Our submission for the RFP was expensive because we built in services for three full years. We don't know that it'll take three years to find 100 eligible homeowners, but that's how we built  how we built our project. I think it's unfortunate that the value of the nonprofits that we would provide for this program was dismissed because of expense without a discussion of possible options. It also seems like there's an assumption that we already get paid to do these services so we can serve additional clients in homebuyer education. CAA does not receive $300 per person who attends homebuyer education from MSHDA.  CAA receives a total of $45,000 between HUD and MSHDA housing counseling grants to provide housing counseling services in three counties.

We assist families in getting prepared to purchase through credit counseling, financial management, and homebuyer education. We are well-versed in walking families through this process.  appreciate the city staff in the Community Development Department and all the work that they do but I do believe that they have misjudged the amount of work that it will take to find a hundred eligible buyers in the 60 to 80 percent AMI price range.

She said that was an unusual request and said, no, that was it. Just no answer, no reason, no why the bathrooms are out for maintenance, none of that. Just for your event, no.

Why can't any of us use the bathrooms? How about that? Just wondering.  It's not as over the top as everybody else's. I'm not talking about taxes. I'm talking about a bathroom that I pay for. 1% of my taxes go to that bathroom. I paid $50 to rent it for the bathrooms. It's a part of the park. So I just, that's it. That's it.

Mayoral candidate for the city of Jackson.  Mayor Daniel Mahoney continues to say publicly that the city's $1.5 million group violence intervention program is reducing gun shootings. It is not. Rather, gun shootings involving gangs continues to increase throughout the city. Mayor Mahoney won't even utter the word gang, and instead he wants us to believe that those involved with gang activity are just South Side groups.  who act out due to perceived racial injustice. First of all, these aren't just groups, they are gangs. Gangs from Jackson and gangs from outside of Jackson. Not until Jackson has a mayor that will tell the public the truth on how serious gang activity is in Jackson, these gangs will continue their violent lawlessness in our city.  Rather than reward gang members with a social worker and social programs, these gang members, first and foremost, need to be removed from our streets with an arrest, a charge, a conviction, and jail. Once these gang members are off our streets and in jail, the social workers can visit them and begin their social work from the jail.  instead of spending another dime on this costly, ineffective group violence intervention program. Police Chief Hitt should request whatever money is left over from this $1.5 million boondoggle and have it spent on putting more police officers on our streets so they can enforce the rule of law on gang lawlessness.",Public Safety and Law Enforcement

I was going to talk about censorship and  You did improve in which you didn't read those rules, the illegal rules, before the public hearings, but unfortunately you haven't totally fixed that problem. Hopefully for the next meeting you'll stop reading those rules, such as being polite and  you know, no direct personal attacks. I sent, for everyone else, I sent the entire council information on that and, you know, it was really bad that, you know, people are here for the first time and you're suggesting, you know, some language and stuff that, you know, if they use it, you know, you're going to send them out of here.  So hopefully you'll stop reading those illegal rules. Time, you know, that's one thing you can do, but as far as saying you got to respect me and don't demean me or anyone else here,  cannot do that legally. Speaking of censorship, there's the We the People on Facebook with Dina Morgan running that and they practice censorship. There was a deal where a couple weeks ago her sister Melanie  I had done a post regarding what someone else had posted, and so she says, John C. King, keep it up. I am one of the administrators on this page, and I will have to remove you from this page if you continue with your MAGA comments justifying slavery. Do you understand me? This is your final warning. There weren't any other warnings or anything like that.  So a week or so, Dina Morgan had ended up removing me from the group. I don't know why. But getting back to what I was talking about with this one case, there was a guy dressed up in the Jewish garb from the Holocaust in the concentration camps playing the violin. Now I'd seen that, I knew right away it was basically kind of a hoax.  And what it was, there was a concert the year after Germany was defeated. And so they were doing a celebration of life and death.  During it while they're playing now with Melanie Morgan. She said it was you know someone that was playing You know in the you know the gas chambers kind of like to sue the people that were being gassed and Killed which was just outrageous So there's so much false stuff like the urban renewal was Negro removal that John Willis mentioned Thank You.

If the city council hasn't quite put two and two together yet, the group violence initiative is a spectacular failure. Turns out that providing hot dogs, hugs, and face painting to hardened criminals  did not put a dimple, let alone a dent, in gang violence. Here's just a few things wrong with the GVI. The funding for this came from a one-time massive federal money drop on Jackson called ARPA. ARPA funds were like the money you might get when a rich aunt dies. You manage them very carefully because I guarantee you she's not going to die again.  Maybe the biggest problem with this program is what we're seeing here tonight is all the people who showed up tonight who are not gangbangers, the people who pay their house and income taxes and skyrocketing water bills in full and on time being hit with $8,000, $10,000, $12,000 street assessments. With the money squandered on GVI, with that money, almost 200 individual $8,000 street assessments could have been covered in full.  Or 300 homeowners could have had their street assessments cut in half. Or another approach, 560 homeowners could have had a third of their street assessments paid for, but that money was spent on GVI instead. Number three, does anyone believe for a single minute that gang violence can be addressed by a mayor, council, and police chief who will not even use the term gang violence, but use the term group violence instead?  The people sitting up here do not have your back, they are not your friends, and they're afflicted with varying degrees of incompetence and misguided ideology.

But anyway, he did bring you, which I do appreciate Jonathan Green, but let's get back to the park. Let me digress and get back. Those bathrooms need to be open. If there's a problem with having the bathrooms open, the city should have thought of that before they put that money into that. Their reasoning was to bring outdoor bathrooms back into Jackson.  You put it there and then you close it. You lock the doors. When there are events held down here in the city of Jackson, those bathrooms should be open to the people, to the vendors, to whoever comes and participate in the city of Jackson's events that are happening. I mean, porta-potties are good, but I personally don't care for them. Those two bathrooms over there, they should be used.  They should be open. The city put them there. The city should be paying for the public works or whoever to maintain them. We should not have to get additional port-a-potties because the city spent money the wrong way. Spend the money, open them bathrooms back up. Let's get the citizens to be able to use those bathrooms. They are there. And I think that that's about it for now.

If anyone didn't know, I love citizen comments. I have every single citizen comment that I've been able to listen to and note, and I used to read them all the time. Knowing what other people think and feel and believe is important.  Because you might be able to guess what you think somebody else thinks or feels, but if they don't tell you, then you don't know. And a lot of people guess, and they guess incorrectly sometimes, because we're human. Now let me get down to what I was going to say. I think citizen comments are important because it is one place where we can speak to our council, and we will know that you may hear us.  I do think there are a few issues with citizen comments. Some ways they could be improved and I think this is something the City Council could do. Citizen comments are not very accessible. They require personal attendance. They require public speaking skills. They are only available two times per month. Council could improve this in several different ways.  However, each way would be costly, time-consuming, and distracting from all the important things you already have to do. I have the free time.  I've created a Facebook group called City of Jackson Unofficial Citizen Comments. And for anyone that would have made a comment here tonight, I welcome you to find my Facebook group and join it. Post your questions. And there's some of us ex-members of council that are answering questions and kind of pointing people in the right directions. Our seven people here are very busy.

So some people don't feel heard when they speak here.  So I'm just trying to give everyone one more place where they could speak. And then because it is Facebook, all the other citizens can also speak back and help answer some of the questions instead of trying to stick you guys with them all the time. That's all.

Some community leaders are working to create change and some are avoiding offending the Go Along, Get Along Gang. Speaking of gangs, the Gun Violence Prevention Program has not reached out to the Walters family. No one has knocked on their door or given them a call.  And I'm here this evening to speak up about the injustice that Terrion Walters is experiencing after he was shot in the neck by his neighbor.

They had a protest to protest thus far and no answers from City Council from the Jackson Police Department from the gun violence prevention program. Zero.  you know, communication.

Another one is planned. And the family and the community needs answers.  After dealing with the police department, going down to the police station, I believe that the unsolved shootings in Jackson are not the fault of the community. The officer said that they need more money. They need a raise. So I believe that families have been cooperating. They've been lied on. And I think, you know, our community needs help.  You all need to step up or step down. Arlene Robinson, we have no war meetings. Things are going on in our community that we don't know about. We still have questions. And we need answers.

When are those railroad crossings going to be opened? You know, I go, I'm coming down Lansing Avenue and it has a closed two miles ahead. I go down Ganson and I could look down Blackstone. It's not closed. So somebody didn't move the sign back so that we would know that.  I don't like to go down West Avenue. I don't like to go down Monroe. It's too bad. It's going to tear my car apart.

I found two people that knew anything about it.  Um, I do agree with Laura, the homes at 900 905 on Blackstone, they're not a two story. They're one story. We need more of those types of homes in our area for handicapped people or people who cannot go upstairs. The other homes look just like the ones that you built in the eighties when you'll look at them.  And if you don't know where they're at, I can tell you later. Our roads are terrible. We can't think of anything else besides our water, which that situation is getting set with the lead lines. But we have to get these roads fixed. It's not just my street. My street's fine, but other streets. You can't have new houses  if you don't have good roads. We are known to cross the state of having the worst roads in the state even compared to Detroit, which I don't know. That's just what I was told. Another issue that I got to quickly go through is that homeowners are being fined for not trimming the trees in their right away. I don't know. That's what one person told me. That's all I can go by.  And she had a carport in the backyard for a canopy for a sun porch. She was fine for that.

Concerning Mr. Yoakum's presentation, I have to say that I think the notion of an $11,200 cap on assessments is a non-starter, and I think it is a slap in the face to homeowners in Jackson. Divide that number in two, and maybe we can start having a discussion.  So on August 22nd, there was a massive fire on North Street at a 200,000 square foot abandoned factory site. Despite a flurry of local media coverage and several code red city alerts, all of the reporting from the city and media alike failed to mention a single extremely important fact about this local disaster.  Here's what the TV, print media, mayor, council, and other city officials fail to tell you. The factory site at 140 and 150 North Street is an EPA cleanup site. It is a site so contaminated with toxic waste that is a direct concern of the federal government and the Environmental Protection Agency.  The EPA recently spent 14 months assessing this site for cleanup, but the actual cleanup was never performed. So what was on that site? Asbestos, petroleum products, VOCs, which are volatile organic compounds, which includes many chemicals and industrial solvents, fuel oxygenates, and chloroform.  This was represented to the public as just a big fire in an old building, but not as a direct environmental hazard that may sicken and kill many people in Jackson for years to come. As the Brooklyn Exponent, which did actual detailed reporting noted, quote, officials say they can't yet say for sure whether those chemicals could create a long-term health hazard to homes surrounding the burned property.  They also report that 25 of the 23 debris samples collected, approximately a quarter tested positive for asbestos. There don't seem to be any efforts underway to survey residents of that part of town as to their personal exposure that day or to measure long term environmental impact. So at the most basic level, incumbents Daniel Mahoney, Will Forgrave,  and City Hall insider and member of the Environmental Commission, Connor Wood, that nowhere to be seen after one of the worst environmental events in city history. They all represent the indifference and arrogance of a city government that literally does not care if you live or die.  Vote the Clean Sweep ticket in November. Peter Bormuth in the second ward, Diane Tomin in the fourth, Steve Ann Sweeney in the sixth, and John Wilson for mayor. The health and lives of your families are on the line. Wake up, Jackson.

This afternoon I was watching the CBS streaming news and they mentioned Joe Biden and the Republicans having  like maybe starting, you know, looking into a more official process of looking into Joe Biden, but they're suggesting that, you know, well maybe there's not a whole lot of evidence against him or anything like that, which is basically a lie, a media lie. Joe Biden has really been directing his son to get millions and millions, there's been over 20 million dollars that have been documented,  that the Biden family has received. Some people think it could be even upwards of 50 million dollars that the Biden family has received from foreign foreigners. So it's not just politics that the White House now will complain about.  But there is like the indictments on Donald Trump, you know, because some people don't like what he says, think he's a jerk and stuff like that. And then there's the Trump electors in Michigan that Dana Nessel  has politically charged them, you know, with crimes. And it's just a lot of people call it sort of like the U.S. becoming a banana republic with politics like that going on. Also, kind of in that same train of thought is some of our  like one past council member and currently counter wood who's running for the city council he gerrymandered things so that laura schleck d would no longer be in the fourth ward and so i had seen on his uh facebook page that  Colleen Sullivan mentioned in response to him talking about sign changes that the Queen's Church or by the school that the sign, a lot of people have been complaining about it. And so that was maybe a reason for them to, you know,  crack down on signs like that. Now, of course, there's a street light there and an overhead light. So, I mean, that's sort of made up. And, of course, with Queens, Connor Wood and Collin Sullivan sees them as an enemy. They don't go along with their politics.  You know, Colleen Sullivan was here, tried to use the inspection department against Ira Combs' homes because of politics. So, I would say vote for Diane Tolman, not Connor Wood. Thank you.

So for a little perspective, uh, we can, should all take a look at what's going on just a short drive down. I 94 in Ypsilanti. Here's a few news headlines. Uh, December 7th, 2022 headline, uh, Ypsilanti church to open first winter overnight shelter in modern city history. Uh, February 2nd, 2023 headline long awaited Ypsilanti homeless shelter set to open Monday.  So Ypsilanti just opened a new homeless shelter with a staff of 10 people just eight months ago, and by golly, that's exactly what you're trying to do right now at T.A. Wilson. So wouldn't it make sense, since they're doing the same thing just a little bit ahead of you, to take a look and see how that's working out? MLive.  M-Live headline September 9th, 2023. Ypsilanti officials beg patience as tensions rise over downtown safety. Oh, that doesn't sound very good. Ypsilanti police and other officials are asking for grace and patience from the community as they work to address a housing crisis some say has led to an unsafe downtown area. Residents and business owners spoke at a nearly two-hour public comment session. That's mad. That's some angry people when you you speak you've two hours of public comment.  During Ypsilanti City Council meeting on Tuesday, September 5th, saying aggressive panhandling, ongoing partying, and public defecation has made living and working downtown difficult. Jen Eastridge, owner of two businesses on Michigan Avenue and Ypsilanti, said during the meeting she has picked up alleys littered with needles, condoms, and liquor bottles, and that panhandling and public urination has driven away business. So that's reality.  Reality is real. You as a body, as a group, by your actions, you are summoning up, you are invoking crime, chaos, and filth into a working class, working poor neighborhood in Ward 5 that's just a 5 to 10 minute stroll from downtown. The city's actions will trash this neighborhood without the consent of the residents and also degrade the revitalized downtown area in the city as a whole.  Anyone who sits on this council and supports turning Che Wilson into what will ultimately just be a flophouse for drug addicts, vagrants, and the mentally ill who pose a criminal threat to the residents of the city is sowing the wind and will reap a whirlwind of furious pushback when the ugly truth on the ground, the everyday reality on the ground for people in the Fifth Ward becomes manifest.  and becomes real. So I would just say you better be very careful of what you wish for. And for people to talk about equity, you're going to be wreaking destruction on the Fifth Ward and especially on the Morale Greenwood neighborhood. Those people don't know what's about to hit them. So much for equity.",Homelessness

Our nation is facing perhaps his greatest threat now. In the last few days, President Joe Biden has named Vice President Kamala Harris the new gun violence czar. After Harris was named the border czar near the beginning of the Biden administration, the legal alien crossings hit record levels. Things have gotten so bad, the mainstream media is even reporting the truth about it now.  calling what is a border crisis being used despite the White House claiming they fixed the problem. It seems like many of the headlines for interviews  being reported in the last month or so, such as the Pennsylvania prison escapee, the child killed in a first day of school bus accident in Ohio, or a fentanyl death of a child in a New York daycare center, can all be attributed to illegal aliens and Vice President Harris handling of the border as borders are. Let's hope and pray she doesn't do for gun violence what she did for the border crisis.  Locally our ward our woke six war council members campaigning on the lie that the large increases in water rates is due to the lead service lines needing to be replaced as if to suggest he had no control over the matter and claiming the increases really aren't that big anyhow. The city of Jackson is receiving funds for the lead service line replacements. The fact is the water rate increases are largely due to the consumers  due to Consumers Energy being able to get out of the contract at the old Karen Morgan plant and pipe in their own water to their plant. Baker Tilley's reports last years have mentioned this several times. That was something our woke Sixth Ward Council member had control over and result in water bills in the city going up by the hundreds of dollars per year.  Our war woke six word member even had the nerve to state his opponent, Steve and Sweeney was being dishonest on the topic. Finally, as a sent off to my accounts, city council member Karen, but now I have to say the most disappointing thing about her on the council was her not wanting to hear from constituents. I read someone mentioned in the last few months that her email didn't receive a return from Karen.  I think there may have been a perception Karen was just mailing it in, so to speak. It was Karen who led the effort in the reading of citizen comments and forced people to have to come into City Hall and risk their lives during the pandemic in order to be heard.  The city council will point someone to fill Karen's seat until it is filled by election sometime in November of 2024, which will be followed up by an election in November of 2025. I push for changes. They had council vacancies being filled immediately as soon as possible, but to no avail. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Thank you, Mr. King.",Governance and Civic Engagement

I was talking to some residents who had their street done, repaired with new curbs and sewers. These people said with the extra money added to their taxes and rising water rates, they don't know if they can still stay there.  Besides the awful way the roads were put in without enough sewer drains, they flood the streets and basements of their houses. And it's up to the taxpayers to pay for that damage also. They said they can hardly afford to live here. How many taxes from these people and others that get foreclosed or move away are you going to get? How much money do you get from vacant houses?  I just want to say vote for Peter Van Muth in the 2nd District, 2nd Chair Diane Tolman for 4th, Steve Ansuni for 6th, and John Wilson for Mayor. Thank you.",Utilities

I've lived at my address for 21 years and I have a neighbor who has been trespassing on my property and damaging it for the last three years. She had a survey completed so she knows the property lines. She spray painted my property in July, damaging it, vandalizing it. She had to trespass on my property to do it.  She placed a trip wire across my driveway, impeding my pathway, so I could not even enter my driveway. She placed a skewer on one side by the fence line and put a string with a skewer on the other side, which she had to trespass on my property to do it. The same day, she took her sprinkler, placed it on her property, but it went all over my driveway from 4 o'clock in the afternoon to 8 o'clock the next morning, keeping me from using my property.  Her water is a trespass on my property. I have four police reports indicating all of this. I filed a PPO. The judge denied it saying that there was no criminal intent, but it was a matter of trespass. He instructed her to stay off of my property. Four days later, she's continuing to trespass on my property and I have her on audio saying,  What are they going to do? She can't file a PPO. She has called me the N word among other things when I have approached her about it. She has a criminal record for assaulting a public officer. So she's not somebody that I want to continue to approach. And I feel like the city needs to, um, enforce their trespass ordinance. Now the city is charging her for malicious destruction of my property and I'm happy about it. However, I don't feel like I'm being properly informed.  I emailed yesterday to see if I should attend the arraignment, which is scheduled for October 2nd, and they told me that that was waived and there's a pretrial for Thursday. I had no idea. This is about me. I'm supposed to be the victim. The city prosecutor's office and the community development office have both told me that I need to contact the police if she's trespassing on my property.  But what I find interesting is right above your MDLP destruction ordinance is a trespass ordinance. So you're going to enforce one, but you're not going to enforce the other. She had to trespass on my property to damage it. And she continues to do so. Even this Sunday. And she has no consequences, so she's comfortable doing it. She's throwing birdseed all along my property to attract the animals and their feces, which is her intent. No consequence.  However, she made a complaint against me with the city because I did not have a fence permit, which I thought my contractor got. Um, so I get a code officer at my house for a fence permit for $75, but I paid $500 for variance. I'm not trying to skirt $75, but she's caused thousands of dollars worth of damage and the city can come out for $75. Thank you.",Public Safety and Law Enforcement
