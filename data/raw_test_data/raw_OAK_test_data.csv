I want to first start by taking a little privilege as the chair and say thank you to everybody at the city of Oakland and others who were at the open house of the Lakeview Village tiny home community that will soon be housing more of our unsheltered community.  With the rains upon us, the winter upon us, I think for me that underscores the important work that we all do as a council and our city staff working together. So wanted to just briefly say thank you to all of you who joined that and look forward to opening that intervention soon as well as having more of that type of thing so that we can work together as a community to house our unsheltered neighbors.  As members of the public are joining us, I do want to first go over our order of business. And then from there, we will hear any reviews to changes in the agenda. Our first item will be public comment. So if you are here for commenting on any of the items on the agenda, you may go ahead and press star nine.  or raise your hand. After public comment, we will hear our consent calendar. And there are a number of items on the consent calendar. And then from there, we will go to our public hearings. We do have four public hearings today. And as a reminder, if you wish to speak at one of the public hearings, you can wait until we call that item to speak so that your comment will be part of the public record.  From our public hearings, we'll hear a report on closed session, then we will approve our minutes, and then hear our non-consent calendar, which has two items today. And then we will round it out with council member announcements and open forum.

Be mad at yourself because you may be it. Don't do the white thing, do the right thing when it comes to our homeless politics here in Oakland.  Once again, I'm seeing little pieces of your oil politics where you have black people speaking on behalf of white people that keeps black people down. That would be Mr. Van. Mr. James Van, you do not speak for me as a homeless advocate because I'm a black man and you said you don't see color. I do and they do. So don't get coming up to these  uh different podiums and like you're speaking for on behalf of the black homeless people here in oakland you don't speak for me i know you don't um  I want to once again check. I talked with Laura Tannenbaum yesterday. She said they no longer charge 30 percent of SSI or Social Security for all black men. Is that the truth? Can we really can we really delve and find out if that's what's really going on? No longer are these hotels charging people their Social Security money or their SSI money. It's important that that's not happening anymore. Also, I definitely.  would like to mention the Downtown Streets program. I watched them last Friday. They ain't doing S. You know, I watched them sit down for an hour. They worked from 10 o'clock to 11 o'clock and then sat down for an hour and then walked back up the same street they had just cleaned. And I saw the street cleaning unit come by cleaning the street. So what kind of money are you giving them to sit around and do nothing?

No matter what the conditions of why you say you're doing it, that's how it's going to look. Lake Merritt is a complete, utter failure. It's a disgrace, Bass, what you've done to the Black community around Lake Merritt for economic empowerment.  Downtown street program, I was there on Wednesday, just like Mr. Parker said, nothing happening. 2.5 safe routes to school. You're targeting Lincoln School in Chinatown. What about the school Elmhurst on 98th, where a mother was killed? And just a few weeks ago, a child got hit by a car.  The STEP program, anything that involves police stops, you got to look at the stop data to know it might involve a disproportionately large number of African-Americans unfairly being stopped. 2.7, if you don't want to deal with the federal government, with ICE, why are you always willing to take money from the federal government? For FEMA, that's what that's about. You don't want to deal with ICE, but you sure will take that money from the federal government whenever it's offered to you.  Number 2.10, an excellent choice for Mr. Omar Farmer to be involved with anything that has to do with the Oakland Police Department, even though he was unfairly not allowed to be on the police commission. I already talked about the downtown streets program, but I want to let you know, racism is well and alive in this city.  I can't believe what you're doing at Lake Merritt. I was there on Saturday. It is a disgrace to have all the police, the combs, and no Black people there.

OAK_11_02_21,SPEAKER_12,"Hey there, this is Patrick Trauber speaking. I'm an Oakland resident and I'm calling today about the update on the bike plan. So two years ago, this bike plan was created and it said that Oakland would create 51 miles of protected bike lanes. And so far, three years later, we've only created 2.5 of those 51 miles. So we're only 4.9% of the way towards  the plan and this is a big problem because as the whole point of the bike plan was to build out a network of safe lanes and Oakland has the highest rate of people killed in traffic collisions of any city in the Bay Area. And it's four times more dangerous in Oakland than San Francisco, which also has a lot of traffic deaths.  We have more than double the number of traffic deaths than San Francisco and they have more than twice the population that we have. So we have a huge epidemic on our streets of people getting killed by cars and this protected bike lane network and the bike plan which had the buy-in of everyone is the path towards reducing those fatal collisions and yet  We're not making any substantial progress on this. I'd like the council to produce a report on why there hasn't been progress on the bike plan since it was passed back in 2019 and a proposal for how and when we're gonna see significant progress towards the completion of this network.  This won't just save lives. It'll also make it easier and cheaper for Oakland residents to get around Oakland and also reduce carbon emissions caused by cars.

OAK_11_02_21,SPEAKER_02,"Hey, Council. In 2014, I asked a question to myself that many of my friends began asking as well.  How can I get out of this landlord-tenant paradigm and do my own housing at a cost-effective way that is in harmony with the environment? That led me to tiny homes like it has led many others, and it will continue to drive droves of people to seriously consider this new and actually very old idea of a home that can move. I strongly advise you to begin to imagine a world outside of this binary landlord-tenant paradigm, one where everyday people like the group that started Neighborship  take housing into their own hands and make their own choices. The ordinance that you're going to consider today should pass, but it's important to be honest about the fact that it will not have much impact on our affordability crisis. And that's by design. This ordinance ignores our six-year example and many other examples like us, where a community of homes on wheels existed under everyone's noses,  No sewer lines were ever installed. Density was much larger than one to three units and the sky didn't fall. Rather, this was a space with a stable home for countless working class people for the last six years. If you'd like to make this ordinance actually live up to much of the lofty language I've heard from you all on the need to open up options, there's two small adjustments. Exempt vehicular residential facilities from density restrictions and allow sanitation alternatives that include port-a-potty service.  In many ways, this ordinance is a microcosm of a broader approach to housing regulations that would flabbergast any visiting alien. We are still too squeamish to permit clusters of poor people to exist anywhere but the most obstructive situations that increase maximum suffering for everyone involved. And we are still too uncomfortable with allowing housing to take a form that doesn't match the standards and the costs that  that are so much that nobody can actually produce them we continue to pass legislation that says effectively you can build a house but you've got to be a unicorn dancing on one leg in the bermuda triangle or filthy rich please pass this ordinance and hopefully we'll get closer to what people really need at a later date thanks thank you and madam chair we have one speaker left and then a hand go up how do you wish to proceed",816,944,"""""",Public Comment,Commenter,1,0

OAK_11_02_21,SPEAKER_47,"There we go. Thank you, Madam Chair, Madam President, appreciate it very much. We, as we know, we heard this item and the related items that are following this in the CD committee.  and had a fairly extensive discussion with some public comment as well, and some amendments. And those amendments are incorporated into a supplemental, which we have before us today. So I just want to say in general, and Darren Rinaletti, that you already mentioned from the mayor's office, will be making the presentation with the details. And then I think we'll hear from public comment as well, I guess. But I just want to say just in a broad brush that  As we all know, we have a very serious housing crisis, housing challenges in our city, and there's no one solution that's going to solve it all. And often what we do is piece together various solutions that help contribute to making it better and at least solving a portion of it. And this is one of those things. This has many elements to it, but I think first and foremost, what this does is  Allow, which was previously prohibited, allow a new kind of unit on private property in our city, and we're calling that a vehicular mobile unit, RVs, tiny homes on wheels, and so on.  and that if the property owner wants to allow such a type of unit or more than one unit in their backyard or on a vacant lot that they own, this sets the table for them to be able to do that, which previously prior to this ordinance would not have been allowed at all. So I'm thrilled that we're putting this forward. There's a second ordinance that we'll talk about in the next public hearing dealing with renter protection, but I'm just very happy that we've  spent a lot of time on this. I know the East Bay Community Law Center approached me quite a while ago, probably almost a year ago, about some problems we had in our existing blight ordinance. And one of the things that this ordinance does today is correct those problems. So I'm thrilled that we're able to do this. And I'm happy to pass it along to Councilmember Tao, who's also a co-author. And then we'll hear from  Mr. Rinaletti and possibly from Director Gilchrist as well.

OAK_11_02_21,SPEAKER_09,"Thank you, President Bass. Good afternoon, members of the city council and the public. My name is Darren Rannelletti, and I'm the policy director for housing security in the mayor's office. The intent of this legislation is to support innovative, cost-effective construction practices and expand the types of housing built in Oakland so that housing can be delivered at a lower price and be more affordable for our residents.  This ordinance by itself won't solve the city's housing affordability challenges, but as Pro Tem Tao and Council Member Call have stated, it's one of many solutions that make up a larger strategy. The ordinance responds to past city council actions, so I just wanted to highlight in 2018, the city council passed a resolution to encourage development of expanded housing options, such as tiny homes, manufactured homes, and RVs.  And in 2020, the City Council created the RV pilot program, which allows residential occupancy of one RV on vacant land, subject to an annual permit. And this year, in June, the City Council passed a resolution which, among other things, directed the development of regulations to allow RV parks in Oakland. Except for the RV pilot program, which allows one RV on vacant land and RVs on public property for emergency housing for the homeless,  RVs and tiny homes on wheels are currently prohibited for residential use under the city zoning regulations and the flight ordinance. This ordinance would change that and make other changes to city codes. So as President Bass mentioned, our office has created a short video that helps to explain and summarize that proposal. So I will do that now by sharing my screen.",2073,2168,"""""",Other,Other,0,0
OAK_11_02_21,SPEAKER_21,"Welcome to our home, Oakland, California. In Oakland, the cost to build new housing has become so expensive that too few affordable units get built and too many residents can't afford quality housing. One of the obstacles that stops us from building more innovative, cost-efficient housing is the city's outdated zoning and building regulations.  There are just too many restrictions to what makes a home a home, and ultimately, who can afford to live in that home. We need to move beyond a one-size-fits-all approach to housing. To solve this problem, we need to update our zoning and building regulations to make Oakland's housing rules more flexible, more sustainable, and most importantly, more affordable.  We need to embrace new, innovative forms of housing construction and implement rules that reflect the way Oaklanders are living today. Now, we are proud to announce the Construction, Innovation and Expanded Housing Options Ordinance.  After two years of research, we've developed a comprehensive law that redefines home to allow our residents expanded options and more access to homes that people can afford. This ordinance would allow people to live in RVs and tiny homes that are certified as safe and healthy on private property. Remove the existing ban on mobile homes and manufactured homes. Create flexible rules for smaller efficiency dwelling units.  Remove certain impediments to building modular housing. Establish more flexible requirements for tiny homes and certain alternative building materials.  These changes can create a historic amount of new housing options and, when taken together with our other housing strategies, will improve housing affordability for all Oaklanders.",2178,2295,"""""",Other,Other,0,0

Individuals who will live in these developments  they're actually gonna get to live in this development and maybe off the street much faster, like half the time that it takes to build housing our traditional way.

When I got back here and couldn't find a place to live,  It was horrible. Even though I saw hundreds of vacancies, but there were vacancies that there's no way I could touch them.  This has been a perfect situation. There's a sense of community here. We look out for each other. Right now, it's given me a sense of peace and a sense of independence. Allah allowing us to remain here and other people to be in similar situations, it would give me a sense of security because  Without this, I don't know where I would wind up. I wouldn't probably be able to stay here. And then I'd have to go someplace else, and I don't know where that would be.  Because part of the reason that I came back was to be closer to family.

OAK_11_02_21,SPEAKER_09,"So as explained in the video, the ordinance would amend the city's planning and building codes to primarily do five things. One, create new rules to allow people to live in RVs and tiny homes on wheels on private property in a safe and healthy manner in all zoning districts where residential uses are allowed by creating a new category in the zoning regulations called vehicular residential facilities. Two, it would update the code to make clear that mobile homes and manufactured homes are allowed in all zoning districts where residential uses are allowed and are treated the same as single family homes.  Three, establish density and open space standards for efficiency dwelling units. Four, establish height regulations for modular construction. And five, adopt standards for certain alternative building materials. On June 2nd, the Planning Commission conducted public hearing on the proposed amendments to the Planning Code and voted unanimously to recommend that the City of Council approve the proposed amendments and find that the proposed ordinance is exempt from further review under the California Environmental Quality Act. In addition, the Planning Commission recommended the following.  More information will be provided to the City Council on utility connections for RVs, and that new regulations should promote utility connection flexibility while maintaining public and environmental health and safety, and that more information will be provided to the City Council on how the City's various tenant protection laws apply to RVs being used for residential purposes. In addition to the main ordinance, which is this item, 3.1, the Construction Innovation Ordinance, we're also proposing two companion ordinances, as Councilmember Call mentioned,  An ordinance to end the existing RV pilot program at the end of this year. That's agenda item 3.2. And then an ordinance to amend the city's rent adjustment ordinance to apply rent control to RVs, which is agenda item 3.3. These three ordinances are considered a package and go together, but we were advised that they should be three separate ordinances. And so that's why you're seeing three separate agenda items and three separate public hearings. I'd like to thank  Vice Mayor Kaplan and Council Member Taylor for their leadership on the RV pilot program. This is a new policy area, so that pilot was extremely important and it was successful at testing some new policy approaches to RVs. The pilot inspired the current proposal and the lessons learned from that pilot have been incorporated into the new ordinance. On October 26th, the Community and Economic Development Committee of the Council unanimously approved the proposed ordinance and the committee made four amendments to the ordinance.  These amendments are identified in the supplemental report for the item and are included in the revised legislation that was posted. And just want to briefly summarize what those amendments are. Section six of the ordinance authorizes the city administrator to develop administrative regulations to implement the ordinance. This section was amended to explicitly state that the administrative regulations include details for an ongoing inspection program to inspect a subset  of newly installed residential RVs every year. Section 7 of the ordinance exempts RV parks owned, operated, and maintained by nonprofits from state RV park rules pursuant to state law. This section was amended to clarify that the nonprofit must be a registered 501 based in Alameda County and that it not own the park as a limited liability corporation with a for-profit park.  This same clarifying language was also inserted into the code amendments themselves. And then finally, section 10 of the ordinance directs city staff to bring a report back to council in three years with information on implementation of the ordinance and any recommended changes to the ordinance. That's because this is a new policy area and we want to make sure that we are learning and adapting with experience. The section was amended to direct staff to also research alternative compliance options for sewage disposable  disposal and water supply for RVs and report back to council within one year on these potential alternative methods. That amendment was included because the proposed ordinance requires plumbing fixtures at RV sites to be connected to the public sewer and water systems, and there is community interest in pursuing alternative lower cost options. And finally, I wanted to talk about a key issue that's related to this proposal, and that's the best way to position RVs and tiny homes on wheels  as solutions to the city's RV and homelessness challenges. The proposal is designed to be cost covering to minimize the fiscal impact to the city. Staff costs associated with administering the regulations would be covered by fees paid by permit applicants. The agenda report provides some rough estimates for fee amounts for different scenarios involving RVs. Some community members have expressed concern that the fees are too high  especially for RVs intended to be occupied by extremely low income or homeless residents. And I think these concerns are important and worthy of thoughtful consideration. And I'd like to share a couple of thoughts that might help the council and the public consider this issue. The city has declared a shelter crisis under state law and has adopted emergency housing standards for state law. Under state law, the city can waive zoning and building regulations to implement emergency housing for the homeless. It has enacted these provisions, for example, for  the cabin communities, the safe RV parking facilities, and the Youth Spirit Artworks Village of tiny homes for homeless youth. Under state law, these provisions can only apply to land owned or leased by the city. They do not apply to private properties, and so that's why the proposed zoning amendments in this ordinance are important. A private property owner would not be able to implement an RV in tiny home village for homeless on private property under today's rules, but they would be able to if this ordinance is adopted.  Adopting the ordinance would open the door to a variety of new strategies and programs that the city and community could consider, including RVs and tiny homes. For example, city funding could be directed to these types of sites to subsidize the cost. That can't happen under today's rules because of the existing barriers that restrict RVs and tiny homes. But if we remove those regulatory barriers, it gives the city and the community a lot more options to addressing this important issue.  So that concludes my presentation. And I really just want to thank President Pro Tem Tao and Council Member Kahl for their partnership in the work and the tremendous feedback that we got from city staff and the community throughout this process. I realize that this is a lengthy ordinance and I'm happy to answer any questions. And with that, I'll turn it back over to President Bass. Thank you.",2548,2945,"""""",Other,Other,0,0

I did want to mention in terms of this particular question that's come up about researching alternate ways to have sewer systems.  that when we brought the initial pilot program, we did look at other cities and we did find other cities that do allow the use of pump-out contracts rather than sewage connections. And that's not something that involves our public work staff. A pump-out contract does not involve city staff, does not involve city...  utility hookups. It involves paying a company, typically a private firm that the landlord or whoever would have to hire that comes out on a regular schedule and pumps out the sewage. And so that was something that other cities have approved. And I do think it makes sense to look to include that as an option. And so that wasn't something that involved public works connections, but is something that other jurisdictions allow and it would allow more sites  to be viable. So I do think it makes sense to look into that.

And then I also took on an administrative role at another tiny home community was known as Bus Patch.  on the same street as the Moms for Housing site. In both cases, we use the port-a-potty service. It's very effective. It comes weekly. It costs about $200 a month. There is a pump-out option from a Blackwater tank. Not all tiny homes have that, by the way, but it often costs about $120 per service. Not cost-effective. I've looked into it. So I just wanted to give you some reality there.  Also on that note of the sewer line, I also happen to be working with the Union Point folks at the co-governed site at Lakeview Village. And for that site, there is also already an existing sewer line, but the cost just to connect to water is $70,000. And that's too much for the city of Oakland to pay. So while the city of Oakland is not willing to pay for water connections in a transitional housing context, when it's for private,  land for broke hipsters or poor people, it is the only way you can go.

And I think that while a lot of folks want to  have there be lots of flexibility, the bottom line is that we have hundreds of years of evidence that we need sewers and that these things aren't unsafe. And so if the government is going to say that private actors can rent out and receive money from people to rent out things, they need to be safe. And so I appreciate that this is creating regulations so that we can ensure that tenants are being protected  I also just, you know, hope that we are really monitoring the situation so that we in this period, I know that there's this time period where people are being given the opportunity to catch up.

I also want to just  say that I appreciate our innovative approaches to how we're expanding our housing ordinance and solutions. We certainly benefited from those barriers and impediments for modular homes and tiny homes being built in East Oakland and the more accessibility of ADUs that will be available. There certainly are concerns in our community  Mr. Van touched on one of those. And so I would love to have some more insight on the question that they propose for temporary ordinance within days. The concern that we hear in East Oakland really deals with how we need to do more to counter  Normalizing a culture of homelessness and ensuring that we have more solutions to address the homelessness that is before us with those certain living in tents and cars and the increased number of RVs that we have outside of residential homes that have not been welcomed by our neighbors.  And so if we can have someone speak to how that question was evaluated with a temporary ordinance versus a permanent ordinance, I'd like to hear more on that. I'd also like to hear, we mentioned in the video that this is something that we've been working on for two years.

So regarding the fees, this is something that we really struggled with because, as Mr. Vann said, we want this to be accessible as it can to extremely low-income households and homeless folks. And if it's cost covering, which the proposal is, the intent is for the permit application fees to cover the costs of the program. However, the city could subsidize  the installations of either parks or for individual facilities, just like it does for other kinds of housing and other strategies in homelessness. So I think this is one half of the coin. This is around the rules and the regulations, but the other half in terms of how do we actually make this more accessible and successful and achieve these broader solutions is a funding question. And we will be looking at increased  homelessness funding coming from the state. And I believe that the Housing Community Development Department is putting some funding out later this year.

I'll start on the data question and the research so that  Reference in a video on two years of research really takes us back to just the initial. Launch of this effort to figure out how we could support cost efficient construction techniques and so as part of that we looked at what other cities have done we interviewed builders and designers and architects we visited sites.  And that's how this package of elements came together. The RVs have received the most attention because I think it's sort of the newest and the thing that folks are, you know, we have less familiarity in terms of treating RVs as proper dwelling units. But as part of that research, we talked to property owners, we talked to people living in RVs and we actually visited some of these existing RVs  unpermitted RV sites. And so that qualitative information was extremely helpful and helped inform the ordinance. I will say that there's definitely a need, I think, to better understand vehicular occupancy and residency and vehicular homelessness. And given the number of RVs on our city streets,  I absolutely agree that we need to understand those and make sure that our strategies for those are informed by an understanding of the folks in those situations. And I think that as we  continue to work on that, coupling that information with folks that are on the street versus with these new rules for off the street. Hopefully we'll be able to line up some of those opportunities. So definitely appreciate the comment and note that it's important that we continue to do that.  And then your question about, I'm sorry, your question about a centralized data center. Yeah, I think that's a great idea. So a couple of thoughts on that is, I think that what we'll see with these new rules is a couple of different scenarios. I think we will see people creating private RV parks and renting out parking spaces for RV owners. I think we could also see people  folks with RVs renting out the RVs to tenants. And so if it's the latter, if someone has an apartment that happens to be in an RV or on wheels, that can be advertised like other traditional apartments. And if it is subsidized with city or other public funding, then it can be advertised and centralized like we do for our other affordable housing developments so that  The city's housing resource center keeps a list of available opportunities. And Alameda County is actually working on a centralized system, a digital portal for folks seeking affordable housing countywide to be able to look at what's available. So this could fit into that. In terms of RV parks renting out space for RVs to park,  Yeah, I think that as these are developed, the city could potentially keep a list of those and promote it in different ways so that folks that have RVs know what opportunities might exist. And so I think it's either something that can happen organically as part of the program or if it's something that the council wants to make sure is included.  It could either be added to this ordinance or it could be a separate item, but I think our office would totally support either of those approaches.",5212,5461,"""""",Other,Other,0,0

OAK_11_02_21,SPEAKER_27,"Yes, thank you, Madam Clerk.  It was decided by an ordinance in 2020 that the exceptional growth of RVs on the streets of Oakland needed a solution. The solution was to try an RV pilot program where there would be an incentive for RVs to move off the streets and to move into vacant land properties. This started in  I don't know when it started exactly, but it was passed in 2021. And we're ending it. It's supposed to be a pilot to help with this issue of RVs on the streets needed to do something. Now we're ending it. We no longer have the problem I would assume. You're taken away from the concentration of this exceptional problem  to try to get another solution that's going to impact the ability to deal with this problem. So now you want to deal with, and you got to get confused because it's not about the RVs. They're throwing that in there, places for RVs. It's about getting these tiny homes built because some people want that. So you're pushing aside the issue. That is a very relevant issue.  Of all these RVs, most of them are non-functional enough to even ride. They are almost non-functional RVs on the streets. But to end a program that deals with the homeless community, to implement another program is not the way to go. And that's what you're doing.  And Kaplan tried to get a guarantee that that program would stay in place. But that's no guarantee because you have rules that they're going to have to follow that they might not be able to.",6300,6422,"""""",Public Hearing,Commenter,0,1

It was mentioned by Martin Luther King, and the words were, there's no logic in racism.  I'd have to also put on this face of what I've been lately trying to describe as the face of systemic racism and different parts of it that are actually visible, such as the Downtown Streets Play People program, which uses people for gift cards. And now what I really am noticing is the systemic racism mouth  And that is Marisol, Natalie Oresteen, Alison Boone, Sarah from the Chronicle, whatever the last name is,  And then you have people like Genevieve from The Hog. She called the fire department on me. Laura Lamberson told me to quit bitching and do something when it came to hoes.

You can see that that was all blatant lies. But it is important to note, for instance, there's not 15 people. There's only about six people. We do have space for nine units there. But it's important to note that the reason that we're in this situation after six years of actually having a really great relationship with our neighbor, Scott, is that once he decided to see us as political social justice warriors, once he realized that I worked, for instance, at Casa Just Cause,  And during the Black Lives Matter, you know, upspring, he saw us as the enemy and decided to weaponize the blight codes and write a bunch of lies. And basically that just descended code enforcement on us and fines. So it's important that this ordinance is passed to not empower such folks.  The other thing is he referenced that these rules were created for a reason. I mean, if you look at the history, there's a great book called Wheel Estate that documents the history of the trailer. The trailer or the RV or the tiny home, they're all the same thing. And they've always been a really practical tool for affordable housing. And that could go for homeless folks on the streets. That could go for a middle-class entrepreneur. And we've had all of those at our space for the last six years. And we've been great neighbors and  The porta potty actually doesn't stink. I think the other important thing to note is that what's coming with this hyper focus on just cause is you're missing the point that this is not about a tenant landlord relationship. This is a new way of looking at housing. And there's an opportunity for old homeowners to open up their backyards for tiny home residents.

OAK_11_02_21,SPEAKER_09,"Thank you, President Bass. And I'll try to keep this short because we've already discussed part of this. So this is the third and final ordinance in this package. And this ordinance would amend the city's rent adjustment ordinance so that residential RVs are covered  by rent control. That would include both the rental of an RV to a tenant and the rental of land to an RV owner to park the RV. At the Community and Economic Development Committee, there was discussion about whether the city's just cause for eviction ordinance and tenant protection ordinance would apply to RVs and whether the removal of approved RVs from a site would trigger the requirement for relocation payments, which are required for certain residential evictions under city law.  The agenda report for the CED committee states that RVs would be covered under the Just Cause Ordinance and the Tenant Protection Ordinance, both the rental of an RV to a tenant and the rental of land to an RV owner. However, after further research and consultation with the city attorney's office, we now believe that Just Cause Ordinance and Tenant Protection Ordinance would apply to the rental of an RV to a tenant, but not to the rental of land  to an RV owner to park the RV. Regarding the question of whether the removal of approved RVs from a site would trigger the requirement for relocation payments under city law, relocation payments would be required if the units are covered under the Just Cause Ordinance and the ground for the eviction triggers the relocation payments under the law, such as code compliance, owner move-in, or an Ellis Act eviction.  Therefore, we believe the removal of an RV rented to a tenant could trigger relocation payments if the RV is rented to the tenant, but not the removal of an approved RV where the land is rented to the RV owner. This new information is included in the supplemental report that was published for the item, but want to be clear that this new information only pertains to this discussion of just cause and the tenant protection ordinance. There are no proposed changes  or new information related to the ordinance, which applies to the rent adjustment ordinance. And under that ordinance, rent control would be applied to both the rental of an RV to a tenant and the rental of land to an RV owner to park the RV. So that ordinance still remains the same.

Yes, when we became aware of this just a few days ago, after discussions with the city attorney, I said to myself, well, we can, not today, but we can bring back an ordinance, a minor amendment to the tenant protection ordinance to incorporate what Mr. Rinaletti just said was missing in terms of  making sure the TPO applies to the rental of land for an RV owner on a private property. And so we could make that change as the council, as the city council,  And I've asked the city attorney to draw up such an ordinance and have it come back to us as soon as possible so we could take care of that challenge that was in the existing ordinance. So that can be addressed very easily and we'll do that in the next month or two. The more difficult one would be to modify just cause and that will take in combination with any other changes we make to just cause  that would take a ballot measure.  As we discussed a little while ago, it looks like there'll be a possibility of a just cause ballot measure sometime next year. And we can incorporate, if we, council chooses to, of course, as I hope they will, we will, that we can incorporate new language that would rectify the shortcoming that Mr. Rinaldi just shared with us.

OAK_11_02_21,SPEAKER_11,"Hi, I had a question I hope can be answered because no one has really addressed it. What there are, especially in East Oakland, lots of people, what appears to be lots of people living in RVs in people's backyards through some kind of  informal situation that they have been usually people don't mark on the blight ordinance on each other. And so I'm just curious how it will affect people who already have a situation have it under control they're not in they don't have to pay any fines because no one's put them on notice on the blight. Ordinance will they be spot checked in this structure that was added in the amendments and if they are will they be forced  to either use the dwellings, you know, bathrooms and et cetera, or get sewer installation. Because if that's the case, that probably will hurt quite a lot of people. If there's a blind eye policy, that would not. And of course, they would probably still be covered by Just Cause anyway, because of how that works.  So I'm just hoping someone can answer that question. What will happen to people who are already sort of in a informal situation like this, not exactly legal, but not like robbing a bank either. It could create an issue of creating homelessness when that's not the case. And I hope someone will address that before you go for a vote on this.",7722,7812,"""""",Public Hearing,Commenter,0,1

OAK_11_02_21,SPEAKER_13,"Thank you so much, Madam President. And I do want to make sure that we get with the administration on the speaker's question. We were talking about this under the previous item in terms of if there is a system that is working of having, say, a weekly pump-out  That if we kick them off the property, they're going to be in a worse situation than they are now. And just to be clear about, you know, why I think it's important that we take action to give better options for allowing RVs on various properties is that the question of like, is somebody who is in an RV in a bad situation or not? And do we call them homeless or not?  It depends on whether or not they have a place to park it. And living in an RV doesn't inherently have to be horrible and isn't inherently great. If you don't have access to running water, if you don't have any way to have power, and if it results in sewage running in our streets, then that is really bad. But that exact same RV, if it's on a parcel where it can be and there's a way to deal with the sewage and the water and the power hookups,  then it becomes a positive. It becomes something that benefits someone. And certainly, as speakers pointed out, can give people a much better situation than a tent and an overall better situation. So I do think it's important that we maximize opportunities for RVs to be in safe environments  with those hookups. So I do want to make sure we'll have some, you know, rapid response back on the alternative sewage hookups and also to the speaker's question about what if someone is already there, are we going to be kicking them out of backyards while this is being implemented?  And then colleagues, I just think this also reinforces something we talked about a few months ago that we're happy to work with staff to bring back, which is that we need more managed RV sites that the city either manages or contracts with the provider to manage so that we have systems that have trash removal and utilities  and spaces for the large number of RVs to be able to be that has that sanitation and that hookup. And obviously that will come back, but we need to provide a full range of different options for where the RVs can be more safely. Thanks.",7844,7985,"""""",Public Hearing,Government,0,0

OAK_11_02_21,SPEAKER_47,"Thank you, Madam Chair. And to the public speaker's question, I think I have a two-part answer to that. One, one of the things that we are adopting or we just adopted in the first public hearing, one of the elements was to remove  what was current law that said an RV, a vehicle, something on wheels that you're living in is outright prohibited in a backyard as part of the blight ordinance. That would be no longer the case once we pass that on second reading. So we are removing one of the things that could have been used and occasionally has been used by  neighbors to stop these things from happening. So that's that option. That's a positive thing that we're doing. The second thing is he asked about the  spot checking or the random sampling of places that the staff would check on, those would only be a random sampling or a spot check or what have you, a subset of checking on ones that have come through this new ordinance that have got the permits and are in place. And then they'd be followed up on, not 100%, but some of them would be followed up on. So  If there is, to the speaker's question, if there is an existing situation that is, let's say, kind of a gray area, not quite legal, that has been in existence and no one's complaining about it, and that just continues, the city probably won't even know about that.  And therefore, it could not be part of the checking up because that only happens with the formal ones that get permits. So he's asked a valid question. I don't see this producing a problem, but we should monitor it to make sure.",7990,8100,"""""",Public Hearing,Government,0,0

OAK_11_02_21,SPEAKER_07,"My name is Lakshmi Rajagopalan. I'm a planner three with the strategic planning division and I have a brief presentation providing a quick background and highlighting the key changes to this ordinance.  So a density bonus is, it refers to an increase in density over the maximum allowed by the city. It also provides an incentive to developers to construct affordable housing or provide other amenities that are desired by the city, such as childcare or senior housing or student housing developments.  California state density bonus law requires cities and counties to grant density bonuses who construct a minimum percentage of below market rate or affordable housing to very low or low income households or senior housing. And by law, every city and county in California are required to adopt an ordinance to specify how the jurisdictions will implement state law.  The first density bonus ordinance in Oakland was adopted in 2001, and in 2014, the city council amended the city's planning code to update chapter 17.107 to comply with new statutory requirements at that time. Since then, there have been several changes to state law that includes changes  that added a replacement unit requirement. It reduced parking ratios. It added application processing requirements for density bonus applications. And most recently, in 2021, AB 2345  made significant changes to the state density bonus law, whereby it increased the density bonus that cities could provide from 35% to 50%. And on June 16, 2021, staff presented this amendment to Planning Commission, and it was unanimously recommended that the City Council adopt these amendments.  And the proposed revisions will align our planning code to current state law. So a brief summary of changes are so section 17.107.1040 highlights the updated thresholds for granting density bonus if a developer agrees to construct at least 10% of units for lower income households.  five percentage of units for very low income households and so forth. So the thresholds are provided in as exhibit A in table 17.107.01 through table 17.107.03.  And these thresholds are set by state law, so the city cannot adopt a density bonus ordinance that requires higher thresholds for affordable housing. Some other changes include revisions to clarify the city's application processes.  Methodology for calculating density bonuses, new section was added. So section 17.107.045 was added to implement the replacement unit requirements that was required through SB330. And there were also some other additions made, other revisions made to clarify language that were more cosmetic and made the language clearer.  And this amendment is categorically exempt from CEQA and there are no direct impacts on the environment. So this concludes my presentation and I'll be happy to answer any questions.",8260,8495,"""""",Other,Other,0,0

So for example, the displacement, the one-for-one replacement of units that  may be demolished and then rebuilt, as mentioned in the presentation and through SB 330. There are some things that the city can do to strengthen and make the protections stronger for current residents. And I would hope that we would be able to do that and potentially delay or put this over to a following meeting so we can have conversation about how to do that because this did not go to committee, this did not go to CED,  We have not had an opportunity for resident organizations to weigh in on how to strengthen this legislation. And it is for those reasons that I think it could be stronger. Oakland has the strongest moratorium in the country for evictions. And it's because of the work of organizations that are right here in our city. And I think I would like to take their suggestions into account on how we ensure that post  you know, the moratorium post the COVID moratoriums ending that we can make sure that we have legislation in place to make sure that they're protected.

Essentially, making sure that people take full advantage and we can get as many affordable units as possible as part of any project that's being developed, as well as making sure that any projects that if people don't realize the maximum that they can take advantage of the density bonus regulations, they may decide to not even do a project.  So that is the reason why we're bringing this forward. And so that is essentially the requirement, but there is not a state requirement per se that we have to do it by a certain date.

OAK_11_02_21,SPEAKER_06,"Good afternoon. This is Jackie Zaneri with the organization ACE.  I know we're here mainly because of the state law change, but we really should be discussing an inclusionary zoning ordinance in addition to the density bonus. It is kind of amazing that other cities around us can require 20% affordable housing with most new developments, but not Oakland.  In addition to that, I think it would be helpful for you to delay this item so that Oakland can implement some demolition protections that are sufficiently protective of tenants if we are going to take time to bring this to Council. This ordinance does provide, in reflection of AB 2345, that state law that if a developer demolishes certain low-income units that they have to replace them. But it doesn't say that they have to be the same square footage.  And this also doesn't require the developer to do anything to help a displaced tenant return or even note the right of return. For example, when a tenant is displaced like that in Berkeley, the landlord needs to subsidize their temporary unit in the same neighborhood if possible until they're able to return. Oakland is allowed to pass protections like that. One of the reasons that I'm here is because Ace Oakland actually has members with landlord threatening to tear down their building and remodel it into something entirely new.  State law does impact tenants and we do need the city to respond. So unfortunately, there is nothing in this ordinance that isn't in the state law. And we know that the tenant protections clearly were an afterthought in the state law. But again, the city of Oakland has allowed the past much more comprehensive demolition protections, not restricted to the density bonus, but applied to everyone. So I think we should be asking planning and building to bring this back with some comprehensive tenant protections in case of demolition. Thank you.",8958,9064,"""""",Public Hearing,Commenter,0,1

And also...  uh i i didn't call anybody a racist what i said was if you're going to have some one side of that place white and one side of the black that's racism so let's get it right i didn't call no one directly a racist you know that's what i need to be friends anyway so what the hell you know she's going to call in and try to protect protect what's going on there with union point park being on one side and the other people being on the other side because you don't want them to  I guess be bothered by the black people. I don't know what the hell is going on, Billy. I can't understand that. I really can't. One side is managed overseers and one side gets to do what the hell they want to. They get to live the way they were living at Union Point Park. I guess they're from Alameda. It's a different jurisdiction. I guess they get to do different stuff.  But what is the criteria and what will be the benefits? Would everyone get the same housing opportunities on both sides of that? Would the food be the same on both sides of that? I don't trust it.

OAK_11_02_21,SPEAKER_30,"All right, thank you, Chair, and to the Chair, to the Council. I think it was stated by, I think it was Ms. Kaminsky, the intent initially was to bring language forward to align with the state  requirements explicitly. And as Laura stated, so anybody coming to look at the regulations knew exactly what's required at the state level and that we had a parallel language in terms of our local ordinance. As far as the interest in beefing the language up in terms of dealing with protections, there are protections that we are required to follow at the state level now, I think has already been stated in the conversations to this point.  And I would think that depending on how we want to link protection specifically to the density bonus projects, then we would be able to wrap this into the ordinance. We might be able to make this a part of the ordinance. If we're talking about a broader protection around demolition generally, that would in all likelihood need to be a separate ordinance, something that is apart from this one particular  density bonus ordinance. So again, depending on how specifically we're looking to link these items, either it would be, it could be part of the ordinance we brought before you. If again, it's linking specifically to density bonus projects, or if we're looking for something more broadly strategic around demolition protection, that would probably need to be a new ordinance, a new initiative. So, and I'll, again, we'll defer to staff or city attorney in terms of any other guidance  along that response. But again, this is really brought forward for the purpose, again, of getting essentially a clerical alignment with what we have to do locally with what is required at the state level.",9585,9702,"""""",Public Hearing,Government,0,0

OAK_11_02_21,SPEAKER_22,"To answer, I think, one of the questions or comments we heard from one of the  participants was that essentially there are replacement units don't need to be the same square footage, but they do need to be of an equivalent size. And this means they need to be the same number of bedrooms and the same number of bathrooms. So that is actually in section 17.107.045 C4 of the planning code, the proposed planning code.",9711,9737,"""""",Public Hearing,Government,0,0

OAK_11_02_21,SPEAKER_16,"I think that the comments recently just made by Ms. Kaminsky  don't address what Jackie Zanari just stated, which is, they said the same thing, which is this square footage. And the number of bathrooms and number of bedrooms have to be the same, but the size can be different. The size can be smaller. So essentially what a demolition could do, even if it were replaced one for one, it could shrink the size of the unit, even though it still has the same number of units. So I just wanna say that doesn't necessarily address what was raised by the public speaker.  And it was also stated that this is not time sensitive. So I would argue, again, if we have the opportunity as a local body to strengthen protections, and we already are subject to the state requirements, then why not just take a little bit more time to strengthen the ordinance so that it protects more people?

I'm questioning in terms of the concerns that are raised or opportunities for more legislation or something deeper. One of the questions that I have is if we were to approve what is presented to us today,  Does that change the timeline of having the discussion on the additional changes that folks are lifting up? In other words, why not, if we are here, allow this to move forward and then the additional deeper changes that go beyond what Alliance would state, that can be worked on and it would,  be the same timeframe and simpler because there'd be that much more focus on those points that are sort of really different from what, or above and beyond what the state law says. I guess that's my ultimate question, staff having sort of at least made sure that we've got this amount of alignment. It's not that it would walk this back,  We wouldn't walk this back. It's just a few areas I understand we want to explore going deeper. So maybe that is worth discussing as we think about moving forward.

And I just want to say, and this is purely for what it's worth, I fully understand and appreciate the points that are being raised  Whichever the pleasure is, if the council were to move forward with this item, we would certainly be willing to take up any amendments to this, bring through planning commission, and bring to committee and council of the whole for any amendment to this to strengthen it.

This case arose out of incidents starting on or about July 26th, 2019. In terms of the background, Ms. Charnick, Jis Skinner filed a claim with the Department of Fair Employment and Housing in August 2020, alleging number one, the fire chief discriminated against Jis Skinner based on sex by denying her work opportunities in connection with restructuring  of the fiscal and administrative services division of the fire department. Number two, that the fire chief sexually harassed Gis Skinner at an offsite lunch meeting. And three, that the city retaliated against Gis Skinner for having filed complaints with the Employment Investigation and Civil Rights Compliance Department by terminating Gis Skinner's employment. Gis Skinner sought compensation for lost wages and benefits and emotional distress resulting from the termination without any admission of wrongdoing by the city  Parties have agreed to compromise and settle all the claims in this matter for $130,000. There was a motion made by Council Member Guyo. Motion was seconded by Council Member Reid. There was one absent, that's Council Member Kolb, and there were seven aye votes. Those votes were Council Members Fife, Guyo, Kaplan, Reid, Taylor, Tao, and Council President Fortunato-Bas. That's the first item.  The second one from the October 21st post session meeting was the name of the matter of Michelle Williams versus city of Oakland and does one through 20. The council authorized a settlement in the amount of $400,000. This case arose out of incidents occurring on or about December 14th, 2014. In terms of the background plaintiff, Michelle Williams alleges that the city's storm drain pipe located in an easement in the backyard of her residence deteriorated and broke apart.  creating a large sinkhole next to the exterior wall of the home. Plaintiff alleges that as a result of the sinkhole, the entire west side of the home, running parallel and adjacent to the city storm drain, is between 3.5 and 6.9 inches lower than the east side of the home. Plaintiff sued the city for negligence and claimed property damages, emotional distress damages, and attorney's fees. The city has determined that settlement in the amount of $400,000 to the plaintiff  without admitting liability and to void further litigation is in the best interest of the city. There was a motion made by Councilmember Taylor. The motion was seconded by Councilmember Gallo. There was one abstention by Councilmember Reed.

OAK_11_02_21,SPEAKER_13,"Thank you so much, Madam Chair. And I appreciate actually the opportunity to give some framing remarks because I want to make sure that all of my colleagues are aware of this law that we discussed briefly last spring in the context of a specific item. But there is a council rule of procedure that was co-authored by City Attorney Parker and Mayor Schaaf called High Stakes Negotiations.  which requires a couple different things. As you all know, the city council has the opportunity to designate representatives to a wide variety of regional boards where we sit together with other agencies on intergovernmental and multi-agency panels and each of us  is representative on various boards. This procedural rule requires that items with over a million dollars of fiscal impact to the city be brought to the city prior to being voted on by outside boards and requires that each of us who serves on an outside board bring an annual report to the city council about our activities on those outside boards.  And so this came up, of course, in the context of the WNBA arena lease, but I would note that it applies to all the outside boards. So if you ever have an item of more than a million dollars, would note that rule. And of course, to the city attorneys, of course, to ensure  to educate and enforce it equally with regard to all the council members who serve on outside boards. And then that brings me to the content. So with that introduction, Madam President, do you want me to go ahead and give my outside board reports or do you have an order you want to take those in?

OAK_11_02_21,SPEAKER_13,"Well, thank you so much. And in a moment, when I get to my last board, I'm going to ask to allow my staffer to screen share, but I don't need it quite yet. I have a couple boards to report on. So to my colleagues and members of the public, I'm honored  I'm honored to serve as one of our representatives on the Coliseum Authority Board, also known as the JPA, which oversees the Oakland Coliseum and the arena, jointly with our county partners and public members. I started there this term in January, together with Councilmember Treva Reid.  And together we worked to open the first FEMA supported large scale COVID vaccination site in America. We worked with them to vaccinate over 650,000 people.  And we personally intervened in order to get FEMA and the state to also provide offsite mobile vaccinations with vehicles that went out to churches and other community-based sites throughout our community to better reach underserved communities.  In addition, we won some very important litigation with regard to the Warriors bond debt. When they moved to San Francisco, they threatened not to pay the outstanding bond debt on the arena for the upgrades that they had requested and that were funded in that method.  And we undertook litigation regarding that and we won. And so that is approximately $50 million to the taxpayers as a result of that work. We've attained LEED certification for the facilities, including water saving technology.  The JPA site also, we work to open it as a voting site, as a large socially distanced outdoor voting site during the election so that people would be able to participate in their right to vote in a safe and distance environment. And we have been working to bring  new events and new revenue generating items, including a WNBA team, as well as leasing the space for filming and other events. So that is the Coliseum Authority. I also serve on behalf of Oakland on the Alameda County Transportation Commission, which represents all the cities in Alameda County, as well as BART and AC Transit.  Together, we passed an $8 billion measure for transportation and infrastructure, including free bus passes for youth and improving our roads and fixing our core infrastructure, including transit-oriented development investments and transit corridors.  We also established a freight committee and have been working to improve the movement of freight and reduce the harmful impacts of freight on our community while making it smoother with things like truck and rail grade separations. And so those are some of the key things with regard to the Alameda County Transportation Commission. And then if we could allow for screen share and Anna on my staff will share screen.  If we could put up the slide now. Has she been let into the panelists?  Okay, and so the final committee that I have served on as well as the Bay Area Air Quality Management District Board, the Bay Area Air Quality Management District Board or BACMD covers the entire nine County Bay region with regard to air quality. And as I imagine, you may know, we have very serious negative impacts on our community in Oakland from air pollution.  particularly in East Oakland and West Oakland and along the major truck corridors through those communities along the 880. This image on the screen is a map of air pollution cancer risk. And if you look at the left side, that's 2005. And if you look on the right side, that's 2015. And you can see that the area of heavy pollution has shrunk.  But the deep purple is the worst air pollution. And so that line, which is the 880 through East Oakland and then hits the Port of Oakland and then goes through West Oakland has not gotten better. And so we fought for the Air District to change their rules.  to prioritize areas based on who has the worst pollution rather than based on who calls the most. And we got that rule change. We obtained funding for a clean locomotive engine for the Port of Oakland to replace diesel cranes with hybrid electric cranes.  And most recently, we won a large state grant in partnership with the Air District, the Alameda County Transportation Commission, the Port of Oakland and others to bring zero emission hydrogen fuel cell trucks to Oakland to these truck corridors in the surrounding areas.  And we are continuing to advocate for additional funds for community greening initiatives, which would protect fence line communities from the worst of the pollution and undertook some hearings on that. And so we can take down the screen. Thank you so much. Appreciation to Anna on my team. And thank you, Madam President. That concludes my report.",11255,11606,"""""",Other,Other,0,0

So let's see, I'm reporting out on the East Bay EDA, the Economic Development Agency on whose executive committee I have the privilege of representing this body. So a few notes in terms of the EDA, EC,  We have had a series of meetings, many presentations from key people and organizations to keep a pulse and monitor how economic development and economic vitality is across Alameda and across the East Bay with Alameda and Contra Costa counties. And then also my role or action is to make sure that Oakland is central to those conversations.  and that we are able to benefit from opportunities that we are being centered relative to understanding the needs as well. So some of the presentations we received are from the Public Policy Institute of California, talking about just general economic conditions and an overview from the East Bay Regional Parks District around upcoming bond measure spending or how bond measure spending is going, clean energy generation,  Topics, aspects of the rodeos, as well as refineries. So the breadth there. And then the Oakland airport, getting in depth in terms of how the Oakland airport is operating, marketing, promotion, and how it's doing in the economic recovery. Policy actions taken by the executive committee have focused on, first of all, establishing a legislative agenda  that has been sort of identified by the EDA as a body approving an annual operating budget, approving guidelines for the EDA to consider requests, how to consider requests from partners when it comes to helping to promote and support events that including the sponsorship process and then also sort of finalizing a letter authorizing  our collective support for the expansion of the Bayer site in Berkeley.",11619,11767,"""""",Other,Other,0,0

I'm also the appointee from the city on the Youth Ventures Joint Powers Authority, which we worked through with the Oakland Thrives. And through a little bit about Oakland Thrives is that it is an essential hub for collaboration.  I want to use that keyword collaboration. So Oakland Thrive deepens collaboration in coordinating a range of public and private collaborative planning efforts that seek to transform neighborhoods into thriving places for children, youth, and families.  Oakland Thrives enables us to break out of the silos. And so an example of the overlapping planning processes and organizations that are involved are through our, for example, with the Oakland Resilience Playbook Update, Oakland Promise Up Together, the City of Oakland Economic Development Strategy, the City of Oakland General Plan Update, Alameda County Economic Mobility Action Plan,  Alameda County Vision 2026, All In Alameda County Strategic Plan, COVID-19 Racial Disparities Task Force, OUSD Strategic Plan, and Oakland Promise Strategic Plan. What we saw took place from that is the Guarantee Income Pilot, Phase 1 in East Oakland Neighborhood Impact Focus is completed.  Phase two is a citywide cash focus is beginning. Any eligible family with low income residing in Oakland can apply to receive $500 a month, where 300 families will be randomly selected to participate this summer. Phase two is a scientific randomized control trial to measure the impact of a guaranteed income on individual families. And the outcome will be combined with dozens of similar studies launching nationally through  mayors for a guaranteed income to amass evidence supporting adoption of a federal guaranteed income. And so right now through Oakland Slides, there is a strategic plan put into place and the project timeline is that from August to September that has already passed, compile and review existing literature, data and artifacts. And then in early October, identify additional data needs, develop data collection plan processes and protocols.  And between October and November, it's execute data collection plan and in December synthesize findings and identify opportunities for collective actions. Our next steps with the Youth Ventures Joint Powers Authority and Oakland Thrives is working on a proposal to Blue Meridian Partners, which they make large performance-based investments to scale up the most promising strategies that address key drivers of poverty and boost economic mobility for young people and families across America.  Another, I am not an appointee to the League of Cities. I know that maybe the other council members who are appointed speak on it, but I do want to acknowledge and uplift that through the League of City, I do have a leadership role with one of the diversity caucus. And so through that, we pushed for the League of Cities executive board to be more diverse.  in regards to the makeup of that executive board, which pushes forward a lot of policy legislation and endorses policy legislation at a statewide level. And so I wanted to commend council member Cobb for being such a great and strong representative of the city of Oakland and of our diverse values and voices there for your participation in that.

OAK_11_02_21,SPEAKER_24,"Thank you so much, Council President Baas. Eleanor Buchan from Mayor Schaaf's office. I just wanted to share a brief summary of the mayor's role as an MTC commissioner. As the Oakland mayor, Mayor Schaaf serves as a commissioner of the Metropolitan Transportation Commission, the region's transportation planning agency.  which is separate from a bag, which three of you are board members of. In addition to serving as a member of the full commission, the mayor also participates in four committees. The first is MTC Operations Committee, which oversees public programs run by the MTC, like 511 and Clipper.  Of recent note, this body authorized the Clipper Start program to implement consistent discounts for low-income riders across multiple transit systems, such as BART and AC Transit. The second committee is the Joint MTC-ABAG Legislative Committee, which oversees both agencies' legislative priorities and policies and engages in state and federal legislative advocacy. So most recently, this body has discussed state housing policies,  and engaged in federal legislative advocacy related to the Biden-Harris administration's infrastructure plan. The next committee is the Joint MTC Planning Committee and ABAC Administrative Committee, which oversees MTC's planning studies and programs and recommends revisions to Plan Bay Area, which is the region's long-term transportation plan.  So just recently, MTC and ABAC met jointly to approve Plan Bay Area 2050, the most recent update to Plan Bay Area, which includes 36 strategies to improve transportation efficiency, affordable housing, economic development, and environmental sustainability.  Finally, the mayor serves as the chair of the Bay Area Housing Finance Authority Oversight Committee, whose goal is to raise millions of dollars to help address affordable housing and housing stability in the Bay Area, specifically within the three P's framework of protection, preservation, and production.

OAK_11_02_21,SPEAKER_47,"Okay. Thank you, Madam Chair. And thank you to our colleagues who brought this forward. We should probably have this kind of presentation every year, every other year or thereabouts. So this is a great idea. I'm glad we're doing this. So I represent the City of Oakland, the City Council, on two of our JPAs, our county-wide JPAs. One is East Bay Community Energy,  And one is Stop Waste, also known as the Alameda County Waste Management Authority. I'll first talk about East Bay Community Energy. And let me just grab my notes here. East Bay Community Energy is, whoops, hold on, is one of the, sorry, one of the newest joint power authority, joint powers authority, authorities in Alameda County that we are part of. And I was happy to be part of the  advisory, countywide advisory committee effort to spend almost two years trying to put it together. And it was put together finally a few years ago, and it's been up and running for a few years, so it's very exciting. And we are one of the largest community, clean energy community authorities throughout the state, in the entire state of California, I think we're the second largest in the state of California. And we really have shown a reputation among our East Bay Community Energy Authority  Among others in the state as being, you know, one of the leaders and focusing on clean energy projects and really kind of, you know, pushing the ball forward. So some of the things that have happened over the past couple of years, they were approved over 500 megawatts of new clean energy projects, enough to power over 100,000 homes with 100% renewable energy. And there'll be more of these clean energy projects, mostly solar projects coming online.  over the next few years. It's very exciting. Also, our Bright Choice product, which is the product that most people have in terms of their electricity generation on their bills, is and will always be at least 5% more renewable than the PG&E alternative. And that's something that I pushed for from the very beginning, and that is what we have in place. And we always have, EBC always have,  has an option for any rate payer to seek out a 100% renewable product option that we have at EBC for just pennies more. And so that's always an option and we encourage people to do that. We have a kind of consumer and customer programs. EBC launched resilient home.  a program to provide discounts on solar and storage for solar for both single-family homes and multi-family apartment buildings. And to date, over 1,200 residents of income-qualified multi-family units are signed up to benefit from this program, which means lower rates and clean energy as backup power.  And there's more, we'll be adding to that throughout the city and throughout the county as we go forward. Also, you know, we know during COVID, we had a lot of people who could not pay their rent, could not pay the utility bills. And so EBCE approved millions of dollars in utility debt relief to make sure that people  were not, you know, they didn't have their electricity turn off and their bills were, people, some people were able to keep their bills to be paid during the COVID crisis where some people didn't have the funds to pay all their bills. So that was very important, kind of a low income consumer.  project. Also, EBCE voted to reject the CPUC approved allocation of PG&E nuclear power that EBCE could have gotten for free. But we decided that we did not want to have nuclear power as part of our EBCE portfolio. So we rejected that on a 10 to 5 vote. I voted with the majority. And so we don't have other than some  negligible amount of nuclear power that's in the statewide mix that you can't do anything about, we don't have any explicit nuclear power in our EBCE portfolio. And so that was a decision that we made about a year and a half ago, I guess that was. Are there things happening with EBCE?  There are more projects coming online. There's a larger wind farm that EVCE is part of over in the Altamont Pass, part of our county EVCE authority. By the way, the city of Tracy, not in Alameda County, is part of East Bay Community Energy. So we are expanding past the borders of EVCE. EVCE also provided over $2 million in COVID relief grants to various city partners and  innovation programs and community-based organizations, including a lot of food programs, including about a third of a million dollars to the city of Oakland for various things that we're doing. So that was a grant that EBC made to partners around the city and county. Let's see here. And we've also provided batteries for customers who have urgent medical equipment. We know when we have power safety,  public safety power shutoffs, medical equipment still needs to be running. And so we provided batteries to people to make sure that they could keep their medical equipment running. So I'm going to move on to Stop Waste. Excuse me. I'll just bring up my notes for Stop Waste. There we go. Stop Waste, which has been around for a number of decades now, also known as the Alameda County Waste Management Authority. And I've been proud to be the  the Oakland representative on there for the past over eight years or so. I know council member Kaplan was the representative prior to that. And also I know that council member Reed in a different capacity was on the subcommittee recycling board of Stop Waste for a few years. And so that's something that she has some background in as well. So Stop Waste is the county's recycling and waste authority.  And they work on a whole range of things. They were very instrumental. They were the leaders in bringing forward the plastic bag ban that exists throughout the city, throughout the county. And they are, over the past recent years, been focusing on organic reduction and waste, composting and whatnot.  And they recently, the Stop Waste Board recently passed a county-wide organics reduction and recycling ordinance, which goes into effect next year that each city has to opt into. And our Public Works Department has already, their staff have already scheduled that, I believe, coming to our city council pretty soon for us to discuss and adopt that in order to reduce,  the amount of organics going to landfills, reduce methane pollution because of that, and promote more composting and recycling the best way we can. Also the board, the Southwest board,  and staff have convened an Alameda County Food Recovery Network, a group of dedicated organizations committed to recovering good edible surplus food and donating it to those in need. And that's an exciting operation. And as we know, during COVID and even not during COVID, we have a lot of people who go hungry and are desperately in need of food throughout our county. We're also in the process of formulating  a model ordinance that cities can use to phase out single-use plastic foodware. Plastics pollution is bad in so many levels for so many reasons, and the more we can do to reduce the use of plastics in our society, the better. Let's see here. On the business and economic development front, Stop Waste started the first of its kind reuse and repair stakeholder working group.  made up of over 80 organizations and businesses and business leaders throughout the Bay Area, throughout the East Bay, working on trying to reduce and reuse products in a way that helps businesses thrive. And so that work is ongoing and that's very exciting. And Stop Waste gives out grants to nonprofit organizations who are also focused on recycling, food waste prevention or reduction,  Reducing use of plastics and so on. A lot going on and we're trying to get Stop Waste to be more engaged on the illegal dumping effort. They are part of an Alameda County task force, but we want, I'd like to see Stop Waste get even more engaged throughout the county on reducing illegal dumping. It's a great organization and there's so much they can do if they have the staff resources to do more.  But I'm thrilled to be part of the Stop Waste Board. I'm a past president of that board and I'm still on the board and I'm really happy that they're doing the good work that they're looking to do and continue to do to reduce waste and promote recycling and climate action in our county. And I'll just mention in closing that I'm, as you heard earlier, I'm the  the mayor's representative on the League of California Cities Board of Directors. I've been that for several years now, back even when Jean Kwan was mayor, she appointed me and Council Member, I'm sorry, Mayor Schaaf also appointed me. And I've been working on the League of California Cities Board to really kind of, you know, move them on a more, let's say, somewhat more progressive path on some areas. And I've gotten them to over time to  not oppose certain things, not be so conservative in certain things. It's a hard board, statewide board to move, but I've had some success in some areas, and I'm also on their Housing and Community Development Policy Committee, and I look forward to being on that again next year. That's it for me. Happy to take any questions. Thank you, Madam Chair.",12287,12917,"""""",Other,Other,0,0

I will also share that our next JPA meeting is December 17th, and we invite you to join us. Those meetings begin at 8.30 a.m.  There were a number of major items that Vice Mayor Kaplan highlighted, certainly moving forward with an item that she's championed with lease agreements with the WNBA interest with AASCG, addressing the Warriors Bond debt funding with that victory that we won, and there were three capital improvement projects  that are underway. A new roof for the arena at a cost of approximately 1.5 million to replace an aging roof that's moved past its useful life. A ceiling of the plaza area to prevent just water intrusion that's cost of $600,000. And replacing the ice plant refrigeration to accommodate events like Disney on Ice and others at 1.2 million. We made some financing decisions on how we will refund  Our authorities lease revenue bonds that allows us to realize those savings. The authority has approximately 38 million outstanding bonds on the stadium that matures February 2025. And we did some initial analysis that we could refund those bonds to save approximately two and a half million dollars. We recommended the support of that and the sufficient savings that could help us pay for that arena roof.  On the airport doors forum, we just met last month. Those meetings occur quarterly. Our next meeting for the airport news forum will be January 19th, 2022. Those meetings began at 630 p.m..

This last meeting really worked to address a number of quarterly noise mitigation and management updates. While we may not make necessarily policy or monetary decisions through this authority, there are a number of issues that are certainly community impacting.  A primary topic lately has been a revised flight plan from the FAA that residents in the Hill areas from Richmond into North Oakland have found very impactful with flight paths that have been redirected from more urban areas over the hills.  There have been a number of community concerns that the FFA has lacked conducting meaningful public outreach and engagement to inform potentially impacted residents. And so we've been working to address those concerns and stay abreast of a number of those items, including management reports that deal with just the sleep disturbance and identifying supplemental noise metrics for how we analyze these issues that are impactful to our  And so we encourage our community to show up with us. The port committee, the city port liaison committee, we've not met this year at all. So there have been no upcoming meetings planned and scheduled. This committee certainly is an opportunity to bridge our line of communication between the city and the port.  I know that we have had a number of informal meetings for discussions on city and port matters and look forward to seeing how we can better utilize this committee to address issues of importance from the city beyond these informal discussions. And there's also been question on whether or not this committee has been useful for us. And so I think we're looking to identify ways to improve upon that communication pathway between the city and the port.

I just wanted to remind the Council and the public, though it wasn't on the list, that the City of Oakland is a member  of the East Bay Regional Communications System Authority, known as EBRCSA. It's a large JPA that was formed in 2007.

I also sit on ABAG, which is the Association of Bay Area Governments, together with Council Members Fife and Council Member Taylor.  And ABAG stands for the Association of Bay Area Governments. And its mission is to strengthen cooperation and collaboration across local governments to build healthier, stronger communities. I'll touch on two major areas that we have been working on within ABAG. The first is around our regional housing needs assessment. So the background on this, also known as RHNA,  is that state law mandates that all California localities plan for the housing needs of our residents, regardless of income. And this means that there is a state mandate  called the Housing Element and Regional Housing Needs Allocation. Again, that's called RHNA under the California Department of Housing and Community Development, the State HCD. So we did work on our draft RHNA goals as a body. We did publish them. We are in the process of hearing appeals from localities.  And in December, at our executive board, we will adopt the final allocations, taking into consideration the results of the appeal process.

Also wanted to share, I'm on the newly created housing committee and was appointed by the president of ABAC, Mayor Jesse Eragon,  And one of the things that we did recently is we met jointly with the Bay Area Housing Finance Authority, which the mayor serves on. And we heard a brief update from Ellie Buchan and her office. The main thing to note there is that we have been polling on a potential regional ballot measure to bring in funding regionally for housing.  which the state approved not too long ago. And based on that polling, we are going to hold off on potentially putting a measure on the ballot for a regional housing funding mechanism until 2024. Lastly, the other major thing that we did, which you heard a little bit about earlier, is that a bag jointly with the Metropolitan Transportation Commission that jointly just last month, and we did approve Plan Bay Area and Plan Bay Area is our  official regional long range plan which charts our course to ensure that the bay area is affordable connected diverse healthy and vibrant for all residents through 2050.

I know that other council members, Taylor, Tao, and Gayo have also expressed their appreciation.  honor as we plan to celebrate his life this Friday. I'll share as briefly as I can, Dr. David Kightley, just sharing the words of his daughter. He's been an incredible husband, father, grandfather, confidant, friend, patriarch, apostle, missionary, pastor, doctor, counselor, encourager,  warrior in the kingdom, prayer warrior, overcomer, trailblazer, servant leader, peacemaker, elder, church planner, and so much more. He's truly impacted lives around the world. He's impacted lives here. Shiloh represents over 40 different nations.  And he served in a great capacity at Shiloh Church for over 50 years, 37 years as the president of Shiloh's board and 22 years as co-pastor with his wife, Pastor Marilyn Kightley. And the church was founded in 1965 by his mother, Pastor Dr. Violet Kightley.  Shiloh has been a strength of support into the community under his leadership. He was a father figure in my life. My heart is still catching up with heaven on his loss as I grieve this incredible champion in our lives. He has ministered and traveled over 40 countries throughout 48 states in the U.S. He serves on just a number of international councils and  pastoral teams that really work to encourage unity among various denominations and non-denominational faith streams. He's trained churches and pastors throughout the country and over the world, Hong Kong, Japan, the Philippines, Mexico, Ethiopia, where we have Bible colleges, Nigeria, Kenya, Indonesia, and India. We have over 50 churches in the Philippines that are also named Shiloh Christian Fellowship.  He just played an incredible role with community leaders. I'm not sure those of you who remember Reverend Betita Cody. At the time of the Loma Prieta earthquake, he worked to reestablish many who were displaced and helping to provide over 100 trailers for those displaced families.  Shiloh continues to be just an outlet of health fairs, resources, block parties. They have the Northern California Compassion Network, which is one of Alameda County's largest food distribution centers. Their church is known for many outreach and engagement activities. There are many things that I could say. I'm grateful that I had the opportunity to be poured in deeply from Pastor David  Kitely, and I am missing him tremendously as a champion in my life. He has also been an author I encourage people to plug into the books that he's written the radio audio messages that are still captured over his life.  I would also like to just honor and recognize the 216 victims since 1996 that were recognized by our DA Nancy O'Malley and the Alameda County Family Justice Center for October Domestic Violence Awareness Month. This is certainly something deeply personal for me as I reflect on the trauma I endured as a domestic victim.  violence, intimate partner, individual who has overcome that trauma as we reflect on the lives of those through this program who regrettably did not live through the trauma that they endured.  I want to specifically call out the names that were brought forth for those who did not live through their abuse in 2020. Those names I can provide to the city clerk, but I'll call them out here because I don't believe that we've registered them this year as the county just provided them to us.

This is our first meeting since the passing of the Honorable Supervisor Wilma Chan, and I know that the Board of Supervisors is meeting as we speak.  and just had some time to honor her legacy and remember her. So as we start this meeting, I do want to say briefly that on behalf of the city of Oakland, we do want to extend our deepest condolences to the children, grandchildren, and friends and colleagues of Supervisor Chan. She, as we all know, was a champion for Oakland and the region that she represented, a great partner with us  One of the most balanced, virtuous, as well as smartest and powerful women, API women, women of color, doing this important work as a legislator. And she will be dearly missed. Also a champion, as many of us know, for children, for working families.  on so many issues that she led throughout her decades-long career. So at the end of this meeting, we will open up some space to honor her and to adjourn in her memory. Secondly, I do want to acknowledge that this is also Native American Heritage Month. We will have a ceremonial item, which Councilmember Gallo is bringing forward. And as Native American Heritage Month, it's a time to recognize that we live  on Ohlone territory here in Oakland to recognize the genocide of Native American peoples and to affirm indigenous sovereignty.  So as we move forward, I do want to go over first our order of business before we go into the ceremonial item and public comment. We do have a packed agenda, so I do invite everyone to be as concise as possible. Again, we'll start first with the Native American Heritage Month Ceremonial.  And then we will review any changes to the agenda. Our first item will be public comment. And when we call that item, you will have up to two minutes to speak on items that are on our agenda.  From there, we'll hear our consent calendar and then we will go to our public hearings. Please remember that if you wish to speak on the public hearing and have your comments be part of the record, you can speak when the public hearings are called rather than public comment. We'll review a report on the closed session. We'll also approve our minutes and then we will have our non-consent calendar.  And I will take items 10 and S12 together as they are both on the Coliseum. I will also ensure that we have an opportunity for the two relevant parties to have equal opportunity and time to speak.

But let me begin with the District 5 honoree, and that is Martin and Helen Wakasu, who are locally and nationally recognized Native American leaders.  As the Chief Operating Officer of the Native American Health Center based in Oakland for close to 50 years, Mr. Martin Wakusu from the tribe of Rosebud Lakota has been instrumental in addressing persistent health disparities affecting Bay Area residents. Guided by his vision, the Native American Health Center has helped thousands of community members access quality, affordable, and comprehensive health care  In Oakland, the Native American Health Center offers medical, dental, youth services, community and cultural services, school based clinic services, and soon will operate a total of 120 units of affordable housing.  Overall, the Native American Health Center employs almost 300 staff members across 17 sites in three counties, Alameda, San Francisco, and Contra Costa. Helen Wakasu, a Navajo, was the CEO and founder of the Friendship House, the largest substance abuse prevention treatment and recovery program of its kind serving Native American women,  men, youth, and families. In operation for over 60 years, the Residential Recovery Program integrates Native American spiritual values and traditional healing practices of prayer, healing ceremonies, and talking circles, and has assisted over 500 individuals. The Waukeshas have contributed greatly to Oakland and the surrounding communities and are well-respected by many of  many for their strength and resilience to help those in need. And it's been an honor to work with Mr. Wakansu and Helen Wakansu. I've known them since middle school, high school years, and the neighbor here in the Fruitvale area. And I'm extremely honored to recognize them, celebrate them. And at this time, Madam President,  If you can call on Mr. Martin Wakasu, hopefully he's been allowed to join us.

OAK_11_16_21,SPEAKER_20,"Thank you. Thank you, Councilman Guyot.  You know, Oakland is home to one of the largest urban Indian populations in the nation. A federal government program called relocation that took place in the 50s and 60s offered enticements to relocate American Indians from the reservation into large urban areas. Oakland was one of eight site cities throughout the country that Indian people were relocated to. The main goal of the relocation program was assimilation  which was a complete failure because our cultural ties, traditions, and way of practice, our spirituality were so strong that they refused to be assimilated. I've been with the Native American Health Center for 40 years. We started out as a small clinic in East Oakland, annual operating budget of a million dollars. Today, about $38 million annual operating budget.  I think it's important for us as American Indians to realize that we are part of the city. In 1992, I had the honor of representing the city of Oakland in Washington, D.C. for the All-American Cities designation. In 1992, Oakland was designated as an All-American City, and I still believe Oakland is an All-American City. The diversity that we have in the city of Oakland is our greatest strength.

OAK_11_16_21,SPEAKER_43,"Thank you so much, Carol. My name is Manny Lieris. I come from both the Navajo and Comanche tribes. Really excited to be here to speak on behalf of the American Indian Child Resource Center. Our organization was established back in 1974 by a group of American Indian nurses who came together with a common goal to establish a social service program for American Indian families and the children.  The families were experiencing difficulty in transitioning to urban living, having been relocated by federal policy, as mentioned by Martin Wakazu. American Indian families were promised job trainings, opportunities, education, and support for living in a new urban surrounding. That support and training fell far short, but not enough to prepare families for the stark differences in living conditions between city and rural communities.  The families often experienced some of the same social ills that were an issue on reservations that lured them to try a new life in the cities. Lack of employment, inadequate training, lack of housing, poverty, and social services to assist them. Families began to experience substance abuse, domestic violence, and sadly, neglect and child abuse of children. Families needed guidance and assistance with navigating the child welfare, school, government assistance, and law enforcement systems.  The program, then called Urban Indian Child Resource Center, known collectively as CRC, was established with the mission to preserve and promote the integrity and culture of American Indian youth and their families. The founders of AICRC recognize that American Indian people have experienced historical mistreatment by a dominant society and therefore had a distrust of their institutions.  AICRC initially began as a social service program for families and today still serves that purpose. Over the years, other programs have been added. Foster care began in the 1980s and continues today. AICRC is one of the very few foster family agencies in the state to recruit, train, and approve American Indian families to be foster families, now referred to as resource families.  So we're really, really excited about our work. We have a powwow coming up on December 4th and 5th, 2021 at La Esquilita. We hope to invite you all to participate and attend and look forward of continuing to do this work for our community. Thank you.",1133,1282,"""""",Other,Other,0,0

Thank you so much, Councilmember Kaplan, for  inviting me to be a part of this day of remembering Native American heritage in the city of Oakland, our traditional territory of Hootchin. It has been a great honor for me to grow up in this city, to raise my children here, to have my grandchildren living here, and to know that our ancestors have been here since the beginning of time, that we have an integral part to play in our home territories and doing the work with everyone that now lives in our territories.  It's a beautiful thing, as Deja said, to see so many of our relatives from other parts of Turtle Island being recognized for their incredible work today and to know that the city of Oakland is moving forward in so many ways to recognize the incredible work that Native people have done and continue to do in our homelands.  It has been our great honor to be able to create the first urban indigenous women-led land trust in the city of Oakland, a place that my ancestors have always been to protect our sacred sites and our ancestors cemeteries and places that have been destroyed and to work alongside of city council members that now recognize that we must work together hand in hand in order to stop this desecration and destruction.  but also to recognize that so many people that have come from so many different parts of the world to live here in our hometown, this place that we have always known to be abundant, this place that has never known homeless or hunger prior to 200 years ago, that we have the opportunity to work hand in hand with everybody that now lives in our territory to stop these things from happening, to change the course of what is going on in climate disaster. In order for us to do that, we must come together.  And I think that right now, as we look to the leadership of Native people across the world, that we can get to those places where we are able to make sure that there is clean water for the next seven generations, clean air for the next seven generations, good soil to grow food in, and medicine for the next seven generations. It's our responsibility as hosts in our own territory  to work with those that are guests in our territory to ensure that those that are in need have the things that they need and that those thinking forward for the next seven generations that are, as we become ancestors, they have the things that they need.

Crystal owns and operates Wapipa's Kitchen, which she opened in 2021 in the Fruitvale Village. Crystal believes indigenous cuisine provides more than just nourishment, it provides healing from trauma. Her cooking and business practices acknowledge that we live on stolen land, connect to the reclamation of native food ways, and educate communities on the many health benefits provided by native food.  As a Black Indigenous leader, Crystal believes in opening doors for more Indigenous entrepreneurs and has brought her ingredients and educational talks to diverse community settings, either the tech world, nonprofit organizations, or educational institutions.

This public recognition of support is crucial for both new and legacy organizations who together uniquely touch tens of thousands of Oakland lives through the arts.  Allocating additional funding to meet the total requested amount is the best case scenario. But if that is not readily possible, then we recommend a redistribution of the allocated $670,000.

I'm referring specifically to a setting up the community advisory board. And generally, the community can make nominations but generally in finding new commissioners for any board on the city.  It is open to the city councilors to make nominations to the mayor and the mayor confirming it. But those nominations are always published publicly. And then people can make comments either to in support of the nominee or in opposition. And this process is once again under this  the last section of setting up macro showing secrecy that is totally unwarranted. The community developed this and there should be wider  disperse publicity about who the nominees are so that people can make comments. I hope the council will once again try to open up the whole process of setting up MACRO and letting the community which developed this program become more active and participate as they should.

From the notices that I have received and probably many others from Michael Hunt about the process going forward, there is a real lack of clear process. With respect to the advisory board, as Elise said, there doesn't appear to be any level of transparency in terms of who will eventually be appointed.  There certainly doesn't appear to be any public transparency in terms of noticing and certainly doesn't appear to have any role for the city council at all in ratifying the nominees, which would be an absolute  definitely contrary to practice in all other commissions, including the police commission. So we certainly hope that you will amend the report or the process that is being offered. And beyond that, in terms of the training for MACRO, the contracts that will be awarded to the people who do the training,  There again, there needs to be a clearly defined process. In the notice I just received, there's no evidence that an RFQ will be required for folks who want to get the contract to do training.

For more than 20 years, plus years, I served as policy analyst for the most senior council member to ever serve on this council. This decision you're making today is not personal, it's business.  And it's the business of the residents of Oakland who have charged all of you of being the stewards of their interests. It's public land.

No agreement with the NFL, no agreement with the WNBA, no agreement with the Warriors, and no relationship agreement with the A's who own 50%.  The Stuart Murray Group, they have four strong points in their proposal. One, financial stability, payment in full on acquisition costs at the quickest amount of time possible, not over a timeframe, not over years, but immediately.  A developer who has shown in the past they have built projects in District 7, as well as the leading Black developer who has built affordable housing throughout this entire Bay Area. A relationship with the A's that constitutes 50% of the ownership,  who have already engaged in discussions to reach an agreement. And finally, community leaders such as Bishop Bob Jackson, Donald Lacey, myself, Brian Shaw, Damian Lillard, Dave Stewart, and Michael Johnson, who have actually put boots on the ground in that community.

My name is John Jones III. I'm on staff with Building Opportunities for Self-Sufficiency, also known as BOSS, where I serve as the director of reentry and violence prevention programs. I'm also a member of the African-American Sports and Entertainment Group, and I am urging you all to vote for this proposal.  I want to start with a quote that's attributed to William Gladstone. Justice delayed is justice denied. East Oakland has seen this for far too long. I was born in East Oakland in 1974. So I've lived long enough to see that in my part of town, we have not seen the development. We have seen a loss of institutions that serve the youth, that serve elders, and that overall contributes to a higher quality of life.  This proposal meets that in so much more. There are an intersection and an interwoven number of issues that's plaguing our community. And again, the proposal presented by AASCG will go a long way toward providing solutions to these problems. When I talk to youth and young adults, the first thing I often hear, and I hear this especially having a 19-year-old son, is there is nothing to do.  And I'm sad for them, because when I grew up in East Oakland at the Coliseum site, we had the Malibu, we had the Grand Prix. Malibu Grand Prix, we had the Castle Video Parlor. The point is, we need people to have a place to have pride in, a place to live, to congregate. And we've seen this, especially with this pandemic that created so much social isolation.  So at the end of the day, the ASEG is a team that consists of Black women and men with a proven track record of giving back to this community that we all love and call home. Now is the time to make the decision because we have too much going on to continue to put this off because that is not fair to the residents who are suffering and living in marginalized conditions. So again, I'd like to thank you for your leadership and above all, your courage.",3470,3591,"""""",Public Comment,Commenter,1,0

AASTG has been working diligently  For over a year, engaging the council, the residents, and making progress in attaining a WNBA and an NFL expansion franchise so that the development can be up and running from the get-go. They've been forthright about their plans and their intentions, and they're always the underdog. They've come all this way without any celebrity or social media antics. And while the Stuart Murray Group has star power and immediate financial resources, and I'm sure they're capable,  They've been lackluster in the process. They've been late to the table. They're disorganized, unprepared, and it seems one of their main development partners has separated from the team just today. They've delayed the process for months and have only brought forth any real plans or drawings, which the public haven't even seen, and it sounds eerily similar to the Oakland Athletics' original proposal.  The AASCG's homegrown talent represents what makes Oakland great, and I hope that the council sees the value of a project beyond just the dollars, but the value to the community in the form of educational, vocational, residential, and financial opportunities for the people who live in East Oakland.

For just one example, a friend family friends brother who has schizophrenia is known in the Community people know that he's paranoid and but that he's trying.  A few months ago, he was pulled over and the cop who'd stopped him said when she saw him, I know who you are, I know your family. This caused him to spiral in a way that could have ended his life. As horrible as this was for my family, it could have gone worse and has gone worse for many people.  I'm hopeful about the potential MACRO has to protect the safety of all of Oakland, including our community members who need it most. But MACRO needs community oversight. It needs a strong community advisory board consisting of groups like MH First and directly impacted people, as detailed in the council resolution creating MACRO. Otherwise, it will just be more of the same. We need transformational policies. We need transparency. We need you to follow what you promised us with this program.

OAK_11_16_21,SPEAKER_05,"Good afternoon. This is Shonda Scott. Thank you, Madam President and Council Members. I'm Shonda Scott, an Oakland native, CEO and founder of 360 Total Concept. Born in District 7 at Oak Dome Naval Hospital, where my mother served as a lieutenant in the United States Navy. My family had a business here for a number of years. I'm a second-generation business owner.  And my family has actually lived in District 7 for over half a century. Personally, I have over 20 years experience of administering small local business programs, notable best practices that are recognized nationally, providing programs that include using historically underutilized small local businesses on major developments and capital programs right here in Oakland, as well as nationally, that have led to over a half a billion dollars being reinvested in our local community.  and many of other diverse contractors working on these capital programs in Oakland. I'm a part of the AESCG team, and we used our best practice to engage the community in the beginning. Before submitting a proposal, we met with over 30 community organizations  Small and large meetings, even in the midst of a pandemic. We did virtual meetings, having meaningful conversations and collaborative efforts that led to innovative community benefits. And that's only the beginning for us because we plan to continue, as we've done on other projects, a track record of engaging the community as part of our equity strategy throughout the entire project.  So I'm asking that you vote for ASEG as we've continued to do this process for over a year to go into an exclusive negotiating agreement, which is just the beginning. So the community will continue to be engaged and thereby and considered in this project with our team. I thank you for all that you guys have done to support this effort in the city of Oakland.  my hometown, my birthplace, where I've lived most of my life and raised my son in three generations in Oakland.

OAK_11_16_21,SPEAKER_33,"Good afternoon, Oakland City Council. I want to start off, first of all, by honoring Native American Heritage Month. It's very important, and I appreciate the honor ceremony that we did at the beginning. In that spirit, two Sundays ago, my wife and I had the opportunity to participate and visit the indigenous red market at the Native American Health Center. My wife is part Chickasaw native from Oklahoma.  And the reason I'm bringing that up is because when we arrived at the event, guess who we saw? The AASEG. They were giving out bags to the youth. The bags had accessories, hygiene, clothing, and items that the youth really were excited about. And I think that's a microcosm of this entire project. We see the AASEG in our community. For over a year, we've seen them  frontline in our community. We haven't seen the other group. Yesterday, I had the opportunity to watch the community District 7 meeting, and the question was asked about community engagement. And the AASG has had over 50 signed endorsements from the community. When the other group was asked, they struggled to mention five. And so really, that's what this boils down to, is community engagement.  Four months ago, this body said they would take four to six months to figure out who they wanted to support. There were 70 murders at that time. Now we have over 120. So inaction has real life consequences. I'm urging you today, vote for the AASCG for an ENA so that they can get to work with the real business of providing real benefits that affect real people's lives. Please act today.

I think a lot of times we're focusing on the negative of this continuing to get pushed back. But if we focus on the positives of finalizing this decision today and what this will do for our community.  The AASCG has set the plan of bringing jobs, revenue, affordable housing to this community. But not just that, they've also have plans to revitalize East Oakland while not gentrifying it. And that's just to name a few of the things that I've heard that they're planning to do. For those of us who live here in Oakland, we know it's a special place. It's a privilege to live here, but this project is gonna shoot Oakland into the stratosphere.  And then worldwide, everyone will know just how special Oakland is. So every day that is pushed back, that's another day that our community can't thrive, it can't benefit from this amazing project that's been set forth by the AASCG. I was at that meeting as well last night that's been mentioned for District 7. And I just have to say, and just to say lightly, AASCG is clearly the right choice.

I hear you say that it is innovative to bring trailer parks and heroin addicts to an established neighborhood. Oppression and oppressors bring trailer parks and heroin addicts to established neighborhoods. These policies are the reason that for the first time in my 15 years at this address, I did not see one trick-or-treater on my street this Halloween.  Because of this oppression, neither kids nor adults have a safe place to play or stroll on a sunny day. Innovation is something that brings a new idea and solution to a problem. Trailer parks have been around for nearly 100 years. They have been proven time and again to bring problems, not solutions. You are proposing to eliminate many of the safety regulations that have been put into place. These regulations have been put into place for safety of the community.  The safety nets should only be taken away when a better solution is found. Elimination of laws without a solution is oppression, not progress. A community cannot run on virtue alone.

She will be one of the voting owners of  of this project going forward if the WNBA chooses to put a franchise in Oakland.

The WNBA is already in conversation with Ray and his group  There's a conversation going on right now about bringing this amazing franchise into our local community. We have never had a women's basketball team here in Oakland, professional team. And I know there are thousands of other WNBA fans like myself who will be joyfully buying season tickets, bringing a lot of revenue to Oakland through the WNBA franchise.

So that is why I'm voicing my support. No disrespect to anyone else. But I know that they have the monies right now to acquire the site. I don't know what the other group has. No disrespect again, I'll say.  So do we want to go with someone who I don't know? I'm just saying, I don't know if they can finish, but I do know the Stuart Murray group can finish.

Second, I'm calling to support the MACRO Community Advisory Board as is without any changes or further delays. A strong Community Advisory Board is one of the most important components of MACRO.  As detailed in the council resolution that created MACRO, this advisory board will consist of community experts like APTP's Mental Health First, as well as people directly impacted by state systems. This will ensure that the program is not just recycling old and harmful policies, but actually developing a new system that meets the needs of Oakland residents. The community advisory board will ensure that MACRO is effective, transparent, transformational, and centers the expertise of the community.  We need the Community Advisory Board to be reflective of the entire city as intended, because the calls for service that MACRO will cover occur throughout the city. And we see this in the data that the Reimagining Public Task Force has of like calls for service data. So we know that we need it to be citywide.

We have been in good faith conversations with AASCG over the last several months, and we've identified many areas of alignment.  in the ways in which we all want to see investments that uplift East Oakland residents and neighborhoods. We're cautiously optimistic that this organization will ultimately make some significant commitments toward the following goals. Any developer seeking to build out the Coliseum and other public land must deliver on quality jobs with living wages and benefits, workforce development, local hiring, and fair chance hiring programs to remove barriers to employment for formerly incarcerated people.  Such requirements must apply across the board to all project partners and tenants. Developers must commit to a minimum of 35% deeply affordable housing and significant funding to support anti-displacement services for East Oakland and other flatland tenants. Developers must also commit to supporting a healthy environment. To contribute to healthy Oakland, the project must ensure clean air, clean up toxic sources, utilize clean energy infrastructure, and support clean businesses.  We also want to see investments in affordable transit, community facilities, access to nature and open space, and youth programs.

Do the right thing. Sorry to say here on 11-16-2021 that I was invited across the street. I see Mr. Obala. We're up here at the Lakeview Tiny Homes. I walked across the street. And by the time I got to the street, she was engaged in conversation with one of the people there.  And he was asking her in a very impolite way to leave outside the gate. Long story short, we ended up protesting. The police were called on a 76-year-old Black woman and a 67-year-old Black man because we were protesting about a fence going down the middle of the encampment with white people on one side and Black people on the other side. I'd like to thank Gene Hadsworth for coming out and giving us some support too as well.  It is a sad day when you're protesting something on the property that I started the encampment. I was walked off by the police while the white folks from Alameda have homes there. This is Oakland in a nutshell.  It's a shame. And we know that a lot of that was due to the input of the hog. And we have the tiny home side able to fundraise and get money while the black people on the other side are under the housing consortium.  And that woman that called in that day from Union Plant Park saying you're not racist. Well, how come you guys said you didn't want to be around any other people? You mean black people? Because that's not many other choices. Thank you, Officer Alvarez, for not being a bad police officer and approaching us the right way. So we were willing to walk off the property, which the gate was open. And the person that called 911 said we broke in. I went to sit down on the lot. The woman stuck her foot on my butt and said I assaulted her.",5967,6093,"""""",Public Comment,Commenter,1,0

We would like to thank you for your support of item 2.17 on the consent calendar, authorizing the city administrator to apply to the CalHome program for funds to assist first-time homebuyers with mortgage assistance. And this is a great step in bolstering Oakland's first-time homebuyer programs.  Communities across the Bay Area from San Francisco, Emeryville, perhaps now Berkeley, are realizing that mortgage assistance is a necessary tool to help residents grow deeper roots in their communities through home ownership. We're also seeing down payment assistance programs being created across the nation, like in Evanston, Illinois, that will provide dedicated funding for housing reparations for the Black residents of that city.  In addition to that CalHome funded program before you at item 2.17, if you take a look at the correspondence at attachment A to that item, you can see that Oakland already has another highly effective mortgage assistance program led by a highly competent city staff, which has remained unfunded for some time. This is unfortunate because the majority of first-time homebuyers that benefit from mortgages assisted by that program in Oakland are people of color.  And there are still many affordable homeownership opportunities for Oaklanders, and the city's programs providing mortgage assistance have been very popular in the past. So the Cal Home Program, which is the subject of today's item, as well as the Oakland Mortgage Assistance Program, which remains unfunded, have routinely been able to directly provide funds to Oaklanders to purchase their first homes. And the cost benefit of that program is highlighted in Attachment A.  With that being said, thank you in advance for supporting item 2.17 today. We truly hope you will support the city's other mortgage assistance programs moving forward. Thank you.",6407,6518,"""""",Public Comment,Commenter,1,0

Just want to let you know, want to get this on record, that last week we came home from working. I've been living with my family in my vehicle in District 3 for the past three years in the same exact spot to find that four vehicles that were used as homes, businesses, livelihoods, and services, four unhoused people were stolen by the city of Oakland. Our vehicle for The Village and three other vehicles people live and work out of were stolen because they did not have current registration.  Several housed folks who live on the same block as us had their vehicles tabbed for not having current registration. So the unhoused folks were never tagged. The housed folks were. The unhoused folks were never given notice. The unhoused folks were never offered adequate shelter. There is a moratorium still in place for vehicles for people to live in to not be towed. But this could be further from the truth. Since Wednesday, I have been in advocacy with members of HOG, Just Cities, and Nikki Fortuna, boss's office, to get the administration to waive all fees. We got all fees waived.  This is the fourth time I have witnessed the city do this when they have towed people's homes. This morning I went to OPD at 8 a.m. to get all the paperwork we needed. Village folks went to the tow yard today to get our truck, which houses the village administrative offices and the cardboard and concrete studios. Because the city only waived all the fees until yesterday, they charged us $189 today. Much better than the several thousand they wanted in total. But they destroyed our truck.  They removed the steering wheel and the steering column, and all the property in the truck is destroyed. Our perfectly working box truck that served homeless folks no longer works. Our art is destroyed. And several unhoused folks are traumatized by this. But wait, there's more. Media came over to cover what was going on when they heard what happened. The tow company locked the gate and locked the media journalist inside the yard.  And then also, I wasn't doing the top part. Two other volunteers were. Me, my daughter, and one of our high school interns were doing Feed the People when we got the call from our volunteers of what was going on.

I just wanted to express my opinion as someone who's not affiliated with any of the groups that have made presentations as of yesterday. We received, as just a typical member of the community not affiliated with many of the organizations and churches and celebrities that seem to have been working on this plan in the background for some time,  We received an email from our council person Wednesday of last week for a fairly unorganized and not incredibly informational meeting that occurred last night where I did not feel that residents were given enough information to weigh in or engage properly to even attend. Of course, as a Zoom webinar, we're not actually able to know exactly how many people were actually in attendance, how many residents.  versus how many people were just developers, nonprofit affiliates, construction, union representatives, financial representatives, et cetera. The whole plan has not been very clear. I respect that we've heard from a number of folks who are affiliated closely, it sounds like, with these organizations, but in terms of actual outreach to rank and file members of the community,  with respect to the agency meeting and not being able to do stuff in person. I just don't feel like the community engagement has actually been there. And I think that's exemplified by the five-day notice for the one community meeting that happened before today's vote, which was yesterday. So less than 24 hours for the community to try to absorb what information they could. It just doesn't seem like adequate time",7856,7976,"""""",Public Comment,Commenter,1,0

My mother, who retired out of Oakland Unified, was a career educator in Oakland  instilled in me and my brothers a love of learning and as a product of Oakland Public Schools and also my father being a product of public schools as well, raising a son who's attending OUSD elementary school right now. I understand and appreciate the hard work and sacrifices of our teachers and also the impact they have on so many generations of Oaklanders.

OAK_11_16_21,SPEAKER_71,"Thank you, Council President Bass. I just wanted to acknowledge a few of these items. Item 2.18, which I am a co-sponsor of, Measure QQ, for our 16 and 17 year olds to have the ability to vote. I think that it's incredibly important, not just so that our students can actually pick and choose who they want to represent their voices, but more so than that, also to get involved early in civic engagement. We know what it means and how important it is  to ensure that our young people are part of the process and at the decision-making table. So this empowering of our 16 and 17-year-olds is amazing. I'm excited for that. Item 2.17 in regards to Cal Home 2021 grant. I'm a big believer in building intergenerational wealth. I fought for some funding in our budget cycle. Well, I tried to fight for some funding in the budget cycle for our MAP program. So I'm excited that we are applying for this grant  And I'm hopeful that city staff will, and it looks like inside the resolution does state that this will also help with low income folks to be able to purchase their first home. As one of two renters on the city council, that is incredibly important to me. And again, building that intergenerational wealth as well. So I'm excited for that.  and am open to working with city staff. If you need extra hands on deck, please do reach out to me. Also just wanted to say in regards to the innovation and expanded housing options that myself, council member Kolb and Mayor Schaaf is putting forward.  This is one avenue in how we create more affordable housing and creating that stock pretty immediately. And so obviously this is not the end all be all, but this is another avenue in how we address this housing crisis and more importantly, the affordable housing crisis.

I wanna also address, as we're lifting up how we take on this housing crisis and the options that are presented to us, East Oakland neighbors have still expressed concern, not necessarily with the ADU,  and other aspects of how we are advancing creative solutions to address the housing crisis, but wanting to ensure that as we do so that we not leave them out in the process of bringing forth this legislation and engaging the full city and those who are impacted, particularly by the RV impact in neighborhoods like East Oakland where they do not see  That part of the creative and innovative approach to the housing crisis benefiting them as we have not shown up fully to support them with a magnitude of RVs that are flooding our streets and our communities and greatly impacting the neighbors who are unhoused and those who are housed with how we balance these approaches and how we can really work together with the compassionate care and outreach  that's needed for those who are unhoused and those who are housed working to have peace as well with a number of impacts that have taken place more with public safety around their homes and around the RV areas.

OAK_11_16_21,SPEAKER_30,"Okay.  Thank you, Madam City Clerk. Good afternoon to Council President Bost and to members of the City Council. I'm Michael Rodgers from the Economic Workforce and Development Department. And I want to provide a quick summary of the major actions related to the Oak Knoll Community Facilities District, or CFD, that have gotten us to this point so far. The Oak Knoll project is a 183-acre mixed-use development project at the former Oak Knoll Naval Medical Center, which was acquired by the development entity SunCal in 2005.  In 2014, the developer, now known as Oak Knoll Ventures LLC, submitted a proposal for a development project which would include 900 residential units, 72,000 square feet of neighborhoods serving commercial uses, including relocation and rehabilitation of the historic Club Knoll building, 67.6 acres of open space and recreation areas, and new streets.  On November 7, 2017, the City Council approved Resolution 86963 CMS, which adopted California Environmental Quality Act findings, certified the Environmental Impact Report, and approved specific conditions of approval for the Oak Knoll Project. Condition 53 required that the City form a community facilities district to finance certain maintenance and infrastructure costs associated with the Oak Knoll Project.  On October 5th, 2021, the City Council approved two resolutions of intention. The resolution of intention to establish the CFD and the resolution of intention to incur debt. This initiated the legislative process to create the CFD. In order to be compliant with law established via the Melrose Act, the resolution of formation legislation must be heard by the City Council between 30 and 60 days after the resolution of intention was approved by Council. And therefore, we are here today.  City staff have worked with Russ Powell from the CFD Consulting Firm Economic and Planning Systems, or EPS, and with Chris Lynch from the Bond Council Firm Jones Hall throughout the CFD creation process. Chris Lynch will now discuss today's steps to authorize the formation of CFD. And I will turn this over to Chris Lynch.",10344,10474,"""""",Other,Other,0,0
OAK_11_16_21,SPEAKER_27,"Thank you very much. Good afternoon, Madam President, members of the Council. I'm Chris Lynch from the law firm of Jones Hall. Formation of a CFD requires three meetings of the City Council. As Mr. Rogers mentioned, the City Council adopted two resolutions of intention on October 5th. And tonight, the City Council is being asked to take a number of actions. First, to hold noticed public hearings about the CFD.  Then to adopt a resolution forming the CFD, the three improvement areas, and a future annexation area. After that, it will adopt or consider a resolution declaring the necessity to incur bonded and other indebtedness. And any of that debt would be payable only from special taxes levied in the CFD. After that, it would consider a resolution calling three mail ballot elections. Because there are no registered voters in the CFD, the voters are the landowner developer.  And asking the city clerk to open the ballots, which were previously returned by the developer to the city clerk. Then there'll be a pause in the action while the city clerk opens the ballots. And after the city clerk has opened and counted the ballots and declared the outcome of the elections, the city council will consider a resolution declaring the results of the election. Then the city council will introduce an ordinance levying special taxes in the CFD.  If all of those actions are adopted tonight, then the city council will be asked to adopt the special tax ordinance at a subsequent city council meeting. And that would be the third and final legislative act associated with the CFD.

So here we have a situation where the developer is going to be voting  to have people who eventually buy the property to be responsible for paying a tax to facilitate whatever is going to be needed in terms of the maintenance and infrastructure. The developer, this is what should happen. The developer right now is the only one that owns the property. He can vote to pay whatever taxes until the property reaches a certain number of residents.  then the vote will be given to them, whether they want to vote to continue to pay. But once he says, or she says, he agrees that this tax should be incurred on any future property resident owners, that is not fair, legal or not. Along with it, you are exempting the commercial residents who will be on the property. They exempt. So this is not a fair process.  for one individual to make a decision to put taxes on future residents with that one vote being the determining factor. It is not fair. Just like it's not fair what's going over at 12th Street. It might be legal in some ways, but it is not right. It's discrimination. This is discrimination.

The special tax that will be levied to pay for facilities sunsets in fiscal year 2069-2070. And the special tax that is levied to pay for services sunsets is perpetual and will not sunset. It will continue to be levied to pay for ongoing public services. The one other thing I wanted to mention, Mr. Hazard had asked the question in the  When asking about the boundaries about the possibility of annexation and what that meant. The City Council is being asked to establish a future annexation area for the CFD tonight. The purpose of that is that there is a there is one parcel that the developer intends to add to the CFD, but it has not yet purchased it.  Once it is purchased that property, it will annex the property into the CFD by voting in favor of annexation. The only way a property can come into the CFD in the future from the future annexation area or any other part of the city would be having a parcel owner vote in favor of that.

The I think it's important that council understand that California law requires that developers provide written statutory notice to purchasers of homes when they before they purchase the property, and it must disclose the maximum special tax.  Again, it's a statutory form that includes all sorts of information about the CFD. Secondly, at the time that the CFD is formed after the election has been held, the city council will direct the city clerk to record in the real property records a notice of special tax lien. As a result of that notice, a special tax lien being recorded.  Whenever a title search is performed, the notice of special tax lien will be discovered, and that will include the rate and method of apportionment of special tax, which is the formula that describes the special taxes that are levied in the CFD. So if a property owner comes in to purchase the property, not only is a developer giving it statutory notice, but the title search that goes with the purchase and  potentially a loan from a bank will disclose the notice of special tax lien.

I understand more that there was interest  And this CFD was envisioned for a larger area to generate revenue that will revitalize this part of our community all the way down through the MacArthur corridor.  I have met with staff on a number of the questions that I had, and many of them were around the number of taxes and fees associated with the project, where there was concern, wanting to understand the CFDs, including our commercial partners as we discuss the financial responsibility for the future residential.  So I got some feedback that was helpful. I understand that on my question regarding just the retail component and that potential offsetting of costs on the residential assessment, that it would reduce the residential services special tax by less than $50. Right.  On a significant tax bill that will be incurred. We discussed at the last council meeting that the residential properties located within the CFD our market rate. There are no affordable housing projects for this part of the plan development within the CFD area that we have yet to  have discussions around our Barcelona parcel, which is five plus acres, but that that area would not fall within the CFD. There is no subject to any CFD tax assessments for our affordable housing projects that will be developed on the Barcelona property.  I do certainly have more questions around the property that have come up since the flooding of the site and wanting to understand how the impact of the significant downpour of rain.

Melrose special taxes are a preferred financing method for developers because it allows them to pass the cost of certain public infrastructure through to the end users of the project. It allows them to have financing that does not involve them putting their own  financial net worth on the line. It's an obligation of the land. If they ever fail to pay the special taxes, the collection mechanism is that the city would have judicially foreclosed on the delinquent property. They would not sue the developer to collect  Amounts from them. The third thing is that Melrose special taxes are typically leveraged to pay debt service on tax exempt bonds and taxes and bonds offer an extremely low interest cost way of financing public infrastructure.

OAK_11_16_21,SPEAKER_21,"I'm Peter Sloat, Public Works Solid Waste and Recycling Program Supervisor. Before I turn the presentation over to recycling program staff, I wanted to provide you with some context about what's before you this evening.  These new state requirements consolidated under SB 1383. They mandate policies and programs that Bay Area municipalities have implemented over the last 20 years, notably San Francisco, Oakland, and all of Alameda County and many other East Bay and Bay Area municipalities. Cal Recycle leaned very heavily on  Recycling Program staff from all of the Alameda County cities in particular, as convened by Stop Waste. Wanda Reddick, Senior Recycling Specialist, has been on this beat for years. She has been the voice of Oakland leadership throughout a multi-year and rather arduous state rulemaking process. Rebecca Parnes, Senior Recycling Specialist,  joined us here in the city only a year ago filling the vacancy left by Mark Gagliardi, if some of you knew him. And she jumped in with both feet to co-lead with Wanda this effort to bring Oakland into the SB 1383 era. Wanda and Rebecca are among the most well-informed municipal staff in the state on this subject matter. And I just wanted to say that I'm very grateful to them both  for their work and for bringing forward these ordinances this evening. And now I will hand it off to Ms. Reddick.",13168,13278,"""""",Other,Other,0,0
OAK_11_16_21,SPEAKER_58,"Thank you, Peter, for that introduction. Given the shortness of time, I will just briefly tell you that the short-lived Climate Pollutants Act of 2016 was passed into law and signed by Governor Brown in order to reduce the impacts of climate change. And rather than go through the entire project, the entire presentation, I want to jump ahead to why we're here today.  SB 1383 requirements for local jurisdictions require us to adopt a number of ordinances or other enforceable mechanisms to comply with this legislation. The legislation goal is to reduce organic waste material to the landfill  75% from the 2014 levels and to also divert edible food that could be recovered and given to folks who are in need or to be resold in some fashion by 20%, not less than 20% as well. And so the programs and policies that we're here today to talk about will bring our existing programs into compliance with SB 1383 and we will adopt one  New ordinance, which is the Water Efficient Landscape Ordinance, and I will tell you about that. Most of these are required to be done by January 1st, 2022. Enforcement by the state, CalRecycle, against jurisdictions who are non-compliant will begin January 1, 2023.  And enforcement upon generators, businesses, and multifamily must begin January 1, 2024. So jumping ahead, our first ordinance is to adopt the Waste Management Authority Organics Reduction and Recycling Ordinance and amend Oakland Municipal Code 8.28.  This will allow us to participate with the Waste Management Authority's oversight of the environmental enforcement and noncompliance of businesses and multifamilies. This is a similar activity to what they already do for the mandatory recycling ordinance. They will be providing noncompliance letters for lack of recycling and organics collection services.  They will process waivers and keep documentation of alternative recycling, such as backhaul and self-haul or shared services. They will be helping with education and outreach tools, coordinating with the Alameda County Department of Environmental Health on compliance monitoring of commercial edible food generators. And this is mainly about keeping food safe and edible  if they aren't going to sell it so that it can be recovered by food recovery organizations for further distribution. They will maintain a technical assistance contract and provide those services to businesses and multifamily that request it. And they will be engaged along with staff on waste recycling, organic waste recycling and edible food recovery capacity planning.  Additionally, the changes to 8.28 will designate the Waste Management Authority and the Alameda County Department of Environmental Health to act on the city's behalf regarding these enforcement requirements.  Adopting the WMA Organics Reduction Recycling Ordinance and amending Oakland Municipal Code will update the definitions for consistency with SB 1383, will require edible food recovery by commercial generators, will add a minimum level of recyclable and compost service, and will authorize increased penalties for specified commercial violations. On to OMC 15.34, which is our C&D recycling.  Currently, certain projects are required under the CND recycling to recycle 65% of debris. The changes required by SB 1383 would require that all building projects would need to require with recycling requirements. That is pretty much the crux of what we're doing here. We are adding recycling and disposal facilities to have diversion performance verified by a third party. This is something that  The construction contractors and others in the industry have requested to streamline and improve their ability to meet the 65% recycling requirements. Ordinance 3, amending the Oakland Planning Code 17.118, continues the work that we're already doing, but adds a space requirement for organics containers along with trash and recycling. And this was approved by the Planning Commission on November 3rd, 2021.  This is a program already in place in the planning department, and they already have tools. Solid waste and recycling staff will be technical assistance providers to planning staff to assist them if they need it. The last ordinance is the model water efficient landscape ordinance, and it adds the state's water efficient landscaping requirement.  which became a requirement in 2015 and is also required by SB 1383. This promotes greater use of compost and mulch in new landscape projects. This is a project or this is a program that the planning department staff already comply with, but it was necessary for us to bring an ordinance to council to be fully compliant with SB 1383 requirements. I'm checking the time, I'm out.",13280,13630,"""""",Other,Other,0,0

Before you this evening is the first reading of an ordinance providing for the borrowing of funds and the issuance and sale of general obligation bonds in the amount of not to exceed $220 million. In November of 2016, an ordinance authorizing the issuance of infrastructure bonds  An amount of not to exceed 600 million was approved by more than two thirds of qualified voters of the city at the statewide general election. The proceeds of the bond authorized by this measure will be used to acquire and make improvements to real property, such as improvement and rehabilitation of streets, city maintained sidewalks and related infrastructure,  renovation and rehabilitation of city facilities, including libraries, public safety, recreation, and other buildings, and acquisition, improvement, rehabilitation, preservation, construction, and repair of affordable housing. Pursuant to Section 219 of the Charter of the City, an ordinance is required to authorize the borrowing of money.  Therefore, adoption of this proposed ordinance will authorize the borrowing of funds and issuance of the bonds, which will be the third tranche of the general obligation bond issue under this measure. The proceeds of the bonds will finance streets and roads projects and facility projects in an estimated amount of 212 million, which is included in the fiscal year 2021-23 adopted budget.  The debt service on the bonds is payable from taxes levy upon all taxable property in the city. Staff will be returning to city council for a second reading of this ordinance, along with a resolution on the terms and provisions of the bonds, the sale of the bonds, the forms of agreements relating to the bonds, including but not limited to the forms of an official notice of sale, a fiscal agent agreement,  and other related agreements and also a detail of the projects that will be included, that was included in the fiscal year 2021-23 adopted CIP at a later date because these bond agreements or these bond documents do require some time to prepare.

In addition to the funds from Alameda County, we would be using funds from the city of Emeryville and from the city of Oakland to support these interventions. The resolution also allows us to accept additional funds from Alameda County for the same purpose if they become available.

So let me do a brief kind of explanation to you about the process. We offer grant opportunities to the communities in the following categories, organizational assistance, neighborhood voice,  organizations to neighborhood voice individuals. Applications to these programs are solicited from a community on an annual basis. Cultural Affairs Stats provides informational seminars for potential applicants to attend as well as opportunities for individual  consultation on project ideas. Once received, applications go through a final review process. Cultural Affairs staff performs a due diligence review of applications. A culturally diverse panel of community peers from field expertise adjudicates the application in a public meeting where applicants are given the opportunity to address panel questions in person.  Based on the scores given by the panels, based on published review criteria, a ranked list is generated. The panel reviews the list to ensure it's confirmed with the best assessment of the strengths of each applicant.  And then these go to the recommendations go to the Funding Advisory Committee composed of leaders in the local arts community who review the panel recommendations and funding scenarios prepared by staff and is charged with recommending a slate which would go to Life Enrichment Committee which was suspended this month.  Uh, the Life Enrichment Committee reviews, uh, FAC recommend Jason's and who's charged with moving the slate forward to the city council, which is what you have today. Um, let me speak a little bit to a concern I heard from some of the applicants that fell below the line, um, regarding, uh, why, uh, we provide, uh, we don't do partial awards.  Currently, successful applications are funded at the level requested. In the earlier years, some funding adjustments were recommended by staff in order to bring a few more applicants into the funding pool. However, this practice had become difficult because  The cost of living and doing business in Oakland and my division staff has just sort of believed that let's just support people at their request. The national standard for program officers is to manage 50 awards at the time of, in 19, 20, excuse me, 18, when we made this decision, our funding coordinator operated, managed 96 applications.  The current decline rate is, or acceptance rate, the decline rate is that 42 of our artists that apply do not receive funding and 32 of our organizations also do not receive funding, which is better than the 2021 figures  which was 84% and 68% for organizations fell below the line. This is due in part from additional monies that we received this year. And finally, I wanted to say, I have a deep admiration and respect for our culture community and the division understands the disappointment of those that fell below the line and we listened to them. We hear their voices and we offer our empathy  I can answer any questions you may have.",14895,15157,"""""",Other,Other,0,0

And they expressed concern about a formula not being utilized in this grant session that had been utilized in previous years.  And I wanted to give them the space to speak to that, which they did at the top of the meeting. But what I wanted to also point out was that staffing is a huge issue around not being able to get the services out and even address the concerns that they had because Mr. Bedoya's  Staff is short, and it is very thin and he's operating on a very very small margin with the number of people that he's working with and that continues to be an issue in many departments so while I raised that.  as a concern is because it's impacting all of the service delivery that the city provides.

Our public finance division has participated in over $1.3 trillion in financing for issuers in 49 states, as well as DC and Puerto Rico since 1997.

OAK_11_16_21,SPEAKER_61,"Council President Nikki Bass and members of the Oakland City Council. My name is Lonnie Murray. As a baseball agent, I am the first and only Black woman certified by the Major League Baseball Players Association. And I serve as one of the many members of the Stuart and Rue team.  I want to first highlight the most important aspects of our proposal. We were the first to begin this journey on the Coliseum site in 2017. We had many conversations with former council president McElhinney and county officials. We then became the first team to submit a detailed proposal to the city that clearly highlights our vision.  From the beginning, we offered $115 million, which is the most offered to the city with payment in the shortest period of time. Our ability is strengthened by our Black-owned financial company, THK, who stands ready to go with a $3 billion in addition to personal commitments from members of our team, which means we are personally tied to the success, which is the track record of everyone on our team.  We are also proud to have the closest relationship with the A's, which makes us the more favorable and likely to have success in securing a joint venture and master plan agreement, which is critical to development. Without an agreement with the A's, the site sits empty. Michael Johnson, a local Black developer and the only developer we have ever partnered with, has built more affordable housing than any other Black developer in the Bay Area.  As our project manager, he will lead the charge for in developing the master plan to build out the 120 acres and adjacent properties also outlined in our proposal.  NBA All-Stars Damian Lillard, Gary Payton, Brian Shaw, Lester Connor, Pastor Bishop Bob, sports agent Aaron Goodwin, Don Lacy of Love Life Foundation, MLB All-Stars Dave Stewart, Ricky Henderson, Biff Roberts, CeCe Sabathia, and of course, former political insiders Elihu Harris, Ray Leon, Leo Brazil, all of whom have contributed their time and efforts to executing a plan of hope and new life  for Oakland by Oaklanders. We came together in this project because we've watched too long as the status quo erodes the foundation of our home. It is with love for Oakland and those within our community, both past and present, that we have joined together the efforts we've individually contributed throughout lifetimes to this community. Together through this project, we pay forward at great scale that which has been given to us from Oakland.  We have a long list of vetted community benefit initiatives with established partners. From 50% affordable housing to minority owned banking institutions with history of funding small businesses in our communities, turning home owners into home owners, as well as lender opportunities for teachers so we can retain and recruit the best for our youth.  while a great majority of our community benefits have been signed off on by the A's. Upon site control, we will begin official negotiations on all aspects, including revenue streams from the site into the community.  Our economic drivers provide opportunity through a host of open spaces we've created. Liberty Square, Ricky Henderson Field, and Coliseum Plaza will serve as nationally recognized youth and adult sports destination, allowing Oakland to be a leader in this multi-billion dollar industry.  Our vision reestablishes Oracle Arena as a premier concert and entertainment destination, focusing energies on areas ranging from sporting events to virtual events and other public engagements, including our work with local Bay Area artists to house incubator style production studios in the lower level of the arena.  Local businesses will benefit from the increased traffic, enhanced by our measures which upgrade pedestrian and biking routes, easing access to bayfront and bay trails, thus reducing auto traffic to and from the Coliseum site. Our data centers will also be significant economic and opportunity boosters. Data centers create jobs, improve local public infrastructure, and encourage skills training for workers and businesses, in addition to driving significant economic growth.  Construction on average employs 1,600 local workers, 77 million living and above living wage jobs, 243 million in output along the local economy supply chain, and 9.9 million in revenue for state and local governments.  Yearly operations supports another 157 local jobs and 7.8 million in wages while generating 32 million per year in economic activity within local communities. In addition, economic and environmental sustainability is at the forefront of our commitment. It is a core component of our collective futures. The work that went into our proposal outlined several of these important details.  Lastly, our group clearly supports sports, including the WNBA. As the first team to have met with the WNBA, it was clear the economic impact for the community was minimal and the pursuit of ownership would be a drain on resources if also pursuing ownership of the Coliseum site.  So we focused on economic revitalization of the East Oakland community. If granted site control, we welcome any incentivized structure for a WNBA or NFL ownership to lease the space as teams have always done in the past.

OAK_11_16_21,SPEAKER_57,"Yes, good afternoon, or good evening. Larry Guyagos with the Office of Economic and Workforce Development.  First off, by way of background, the city received a number of unsolicited proposals over the last year from different parties interested in developing the city's 50% undivided portion of the Coliseum complex parcel. And back in July of this year, council further directed the city administrator to negotiate non-exclusively with two of the parties that are before you tonight, AASEG and the Dave Stewart and Lonnie Murray group.  Council also directed staff to return in six months or in January of 2022 for further action on a potential developer of this undivided parcel. Per this direction, staff has been in discussions with both groups and has reached agreement on a number of key important ENA terms, including agreeing on a non-refundable ENA fee to the tune of 200,000 per year,  Also reaching an agreement on a project expense payment in which the selected developer will pay all of the actual city's costs associated with implementing the project. And also a requirement that the selected developer will be required to reach an agreement with the other 50% owner of the Coliseum.  on a plan for the property with the cooperation of the city as needed. However, staff is still in the process of completing its review and due diligence on each team's development experience and the commitments of each team's financial capital partners. In addition, the composition of each development team is still evolving with both teams adding new members, including new members that were shared last night at the community meeting hosted by council member Reed.  And finally, as a reminder, staff still has not received written confirmation from state HCD regarding concurrence with city's compliance with SLA procedures and processes with regards to the Coliseum property. Therefore, due to these reasons, staff still recommends that we should still be allowed to complete our due diligence on both teams and return to council in January 2022 per council's original direction.

OAK_11_16_21,SPEAKER_64,"Yes, Council President Bass, I probably need just a little bit more time because there's certainly been a lot of conversation and discussion, including since last night's town hall. I want to thank our economic workforce development team, Ms. Kahn and Mr. Gallegos for being available to share from the city and address questions.  Thank the Dave Stewart, Lonnie Murray group, the AASCG group. It was a helpful discussion. Both teams showed up with notable community leaders and expressions of their support. Last night's meeting was really about ensuring more transparency for  District 7 residents, our organizations and businesses who are in close proximity to the site in our district. It has been critical throughout this process as we have shared in every forum on this topic for our neighbors to hear directly from the city and in this opportunity last night from the proposers.  Residents appreciated how they were involved in providing some input on this multi-million dollar business deal. They expressed certainly concern, as we heard from  at least one East Oakland neighbor tonight that they regret that there has not been more time to evaluate such a critical business deal in this phase and have supported further due diligence on financial and other areas requested from staff. I have also had overwhelming feedback and support from those who have been engaged, including over 120 who joined with us last night, a number of them to move forward into an ENA.  I have believed from the beginning that this process should have been completed through a formal, transparent, clear RFP process just due to the magnitude of confusion from the moment we came in office around this project and it not being clear between the Coliseum and Howard Terminal. There's been a number of concerns that have been expressed from me and the community about it being rushed through.  And yet here we are, majority of the community members we've heard from even today and at every meeting are ready to move this project forward with the hopes and expectation that there will be deep investment, deeper support for resident services and a much needed economic revitalization and community vitality for East Oakland commercial corridors as well. This project is a part of our 800 acre Coliseum specific plan and this project should ignite  that plan and bring it to live off of the papers that have been there since 2014 2015. I want to speak to the East Oakland residents who have expressed their concern today and those who have weighed in into our office with calls and emails about the process and feeling that they've had limited engagement. We recognize that last night's meeting did not provide all the time.  that residents hope before moving this item forward into this discussion today. I have advocated through this process in open and closed session for more time to engage our D7 community to learn about the developer's proposals to weigh in on that information presented  And I too regret that they've not had that time prior to today's discussion. And so I just want to encourage those residents who certainly feel that way to stay connected with us as the next phase may very well progress today through the ENA.  I want to share that what is exciting about this moment is that this is a long waited project for development for East Oakland residents. There has been fear of a black hole being created in this space and so there is excitement around seeing this incredible economic engine fuel benefits that are significant to East Oakland neighbors and businesses, as it will our entire city.  I want to also share that I'm glad that as we work to address racial inequities and disparities in our city's contracting process and how we show up, that through this project we have shown that we are working intentionally to break barriers for Black and women-owned businesses. We have two Black developers and two Black developer women-led teams.  Both certainly have expressed their qualifications, and it's exciting to see us engaging with these teams with that level of representation.  There have been questions that came up last night that range from the proposer's commitment to local hire, plans to support returning citizens, their commitment to family-sustaining permanent jobs, deeply affordable housing goals, grant funding opportunities to restore and allow Oaklanders to remain in their homes with anti-displacement outreach services,  There has been strong concern around just environmental justice and stewardship youth and senior programs services sports entertainment open space and trails into the Community. Ensuring black prime and subs are leading on this project, as we should more for all of our city projects. And there have been concerns around and questions about the black financial partners are they.  Are the financial partners who will own a significant part of this deal black? And will there be programs to keep our community clean and healthy that come out of this developer's commitment? And the last question was actually brought up by one of our speakers. And it talked about what are the proposed terms that we want to hear more on how we will carve out community ownership in this development project.  We have received inquiries since it was shared today about the fractional ownership opportunities and what that means and how it will benefit to them.  I just want to further say we've talked about just the disproportionate impacts of COVID-19. We know what those data rates are for Black and Brown community members in East Oakland. We know that the Oakland Coliseum is a critical factor in ensuring how we show up for our community and revitalize in East Oakland. And yet I have to be honest about what I'm hearing from residents.  With that, there have been exciting ideas and visions shared by both developers. The residents have certainly seen that they have unique proposals, that they have some aligned qualifications. There were questions around how both of the developers could partner together if one received the ENA or if there was an opportunity for the city to do a dual ENA. Those are questions from the community.  Yet it has been made more clear from the community feedback, as we have heard again today, that there have been significantly more outreach efforts and engagement at our city meetings and with community meetings by one particular developer, and that's AASCG. The feedback has been that they provided more opportunities for access to its leadership team,  bringing community together in intergenerational and diverse community settings for support, allowing them to be at the table, seeing them share at NCPCs, meeting neighbors in the hills and the flatlands for national night out, community cleanups, school supply events, resource fairs, town halls, community meetings since the city publicly went into this process of negotiations.  And I regret to share that during those same months, the public has not seen that level of engagement from our other partner, the Stuart Murray Group, for their support. And so we weren't able, Council President Bass, to get to all the questions last night. And I won't pose all of those questions here today. But there are about five questions that I believe may be helpful for the community community.  that is awaiting a response as we have sent these questions to both developers. And I want to thank them both for just their immediate response and turnaround.  of answers. And so I'd like to just throw the questions out. Certainly there could be time given for the other council members to share their feedback as we await responses to all the questions. The first question was more environmental in nature and it really sought to understand what type of independent environmental study or biologist reports will be conducted to minimize any disturbance  runoff impacts to the estuary next to the Coliseum and into the community as they are concerned about environmental justice and stewardship. The second question is really related to hearing in both visions information on housing, affordable housing, commitment to jobs and other community benefits. However, they've not heard plans for how new schools  and higher education will be supported with the growth through this development. They have also had some wanting to understand the mix of affordable housing. They have heard from one group specific percentages around affordable homes, but there has been a question around what will that diversity of affordable housing look like? Will it include tiny homes in that mix and other creative, innovative housing solutions at this site?  There are concerns regarding traffic impacts and wanting to hear from the city and the developer on how we are addressing, what is the plan to address the high levels of traffic that will occur and how we plan to mitigate traffic impacts into the community.  And then the last two questions, how will members of the Black community access the construction jobs on this development project? What will that outreach and engagement look like and who will be leading that effort into the community as proposed by these developers? And the last question is where can residents find the published plans and links to the team partners,  Anything that they have shared publicly that is available for the public to engage deeper into the partners and who is making up their teams as they assess further their vision and their plan.

I would be happy to second that motion and to move this item forward using the revised version that came from the attorneys in the administration with their cleanup language.  in it as the attorney has ruled is before us properly noticed today to vote for. I did wanna make sure to note that what is before us today is a vote to enter into an ENA, that is to say a negotiating agreement, a direction to negotiate.  Today's vote is not on the final development agreement that would come back to council. And I would certainly expect that the council member of the district and other interested parties would be provided ample opportunity to be thoroughly involved  in those details long before the development agreement were to return to council, which would be after those items are negotiated during the ENA period. I also wanted to make sure everybody heard the comments with regard to the community benefits agreement. There is a extensive grassroots community benefits coalition in Oakland that has worked extensively over the years with community, including specifically in East Oakland.  to advocate for community benefits, specifically including things like deeply affordable housing and anti-displacement measures, worker protections and quality job protections. And AASCG has signed an agreement with them to undertake that. And of course, for this resolution, that will be a requirement prior to the item coming back to council.  with the development agreement. And so I support and second this motion because we have a unique opportunity to use this centrally located large piece of available public land in a way that will benefit the community that includes pursuing partnerships and other opportunities as well as the direct financial payment.  And so I'm happy for us to move forward doing that, knowing that we will require those community benefits and that agreement to be a part of the ultimate development agreement when it comes back to us.

OAK_11_16_21,SPEAKER_32,"Great. Thank you, Madam Chair and colleagues. Let's see.  I guess I'll say it's important that we do acknowledge what this decision is and what it isn't. It's not the final sales agreement or long-term lease. It is a commitment to work with one group to move forward. So we also know that by negotiating, we will clarify deal terms, but we don't have those today to decide on either. And so  As this represents a path forward or step forward into the next phase of this project or development coming into fruition. I also think it's important to acknowledge the difficult job that we have as decision makers striking the right balance between first having the full rigorous analysis needed. Because our job is to be good stewards of the public resources and  We would always and could always benefit from a little bit more information and a little bit more information as we seek to protect public dollars land and the, you know, uplift our people. But we also have to balance this with the desire to ensure the highest value project, the fastest time to value because  We have unfortunately had the travesty of an underutilized property for so long that has been not adding to, but taking away from the experience in East Oakland and the value of lives in East Oakland. District six residents are just as close to the Coliseum, you know, a stone's throw away from the Coliseum as district seven residents. And so the impact is just as direct  even though the Coliseum actually resides in District 7. And so it's absolutely important that we get this right in a way that does bring East Oakland up along with this. I'm excited to see two Black-led development teams that are, you know, here at the table bringing these inspirational, inspiring visions. I do think that...  When we talk about new information that we could get in the next six weeks, the remainder of the time that we had, I am curious to know from staff, what additional sort of information are you anticipating that we could get? The financial commitments from the financial backers, it sounds as though we've gotten that, at least from  One of the teams, I did have some questions regarding, I don't know who THK Investments is. That seems like a new player that was added on the Dave Stewart, from the Dave Stewart team. And so I was curious who they were, because I don't think we had the chance to get briefed and review that. As far as what I would like to see and think is important to see in the ENA phase, it's  that we really look at the evaluation criteria. And these are things that I've had a chance to talk to both of the groups, or at least bring up with representatives of the groups. The experience developing a major project, I think, is an important piece, one that we should know today before making an E&A decision. And I think we have a pretty clear understanding of those who have been part of the team.  Payment in full. This is one that I think is important. We do have to recognize that if we had passed a decision back in July when it was first teed up, we would be talking about a value that is $35 million less than what we're talking about now. So there's absolutely been value over the last four months in terms of  where we have gotten to just in terms of the sales or lease price that's sort of the marker that we're at. I think they're for just Oakland and community benefit. I think one thing to look at as we move forward is that value today versus if that same dollar amount gets spread over time, then  the present day value or net present value is going to be significantly less. And so I think we absolutely need to hold to a deal that makes it comparative to today in today's terms, what we've been talking about. I do appreciate the fractional ownership. I had talked to the ASEG group early on about that and gotten their commitment around allowing Oaklanders to invest in this project.  project so that they share some equity in this project and the upside of it. I also think that, you know, I'll echo the sentiments that we've heard from community stakeholders and also the some of my colleagues and the community engagement from one group versus the other has been imbalanced.  And I think that says a lot from when I first made comments back in July, I had emphasized how I have been impressed with how AASCG has shown up, how they have engaged, and that still remains a gap based on what I've seen and what I've heard. I also think that it's  important that we do maintain the lease option as well as a potential acquisition option for moving forward. And I believe that that's reflected in the resolution that's there as well. Bottom line is, and I guess the last thing that I'll say that is important to me is it's the speed of getting to value and the highest value for the  Oakland residents and for our city. And in looking at that, I think it is important. It seems as though we've got a group that's willing to lead and push the A's forward as opposed to simply, I will say, taking their lead. And we know that if the A's are focused on Howard Terminal, then it could very easily be that they are dragging their feet and not  leaving that sort of not pushing forward so that East Oakland gets the fastest possible benefit.

And I also want to appreciate the due diligence so far that the staff has  our economic development and city administration staff have done as they are, as is their job to do. And what I what I read and we heard today, what I read in the staff report and heard today was that they need a couple more months to get to get us what they believe would be enough information for us to be able to make a positive decision or a good decision based on the information we need in the  eight and a half years or however long I've been on the city council. I and the many closed sessions and many discussions we've had in closed session decisions we've had an open and closed session. I don't remember ever shortcutting a process where if the staff said they needed a few more months.  The council said, no, you can't have that. So this would be unprecedented, at least in my time in the council. And so I'm comfortable going along with staff's recommendation and coming back. So we have that more information in January, which is not that far away. You know, it's end of the year holiday time coming up here. And that's what I would like to do.

I think that it's incredibly, well, first of all, thank you both for both sides in regards to your interest in this plot of land, and not just that, but for your interest in developing it. I appreciate that you're both Black-owned, and we're trying to move forward in  engaging with the community and making sure that we had deep investments. At the end of the day, this is public land and I'm a big champion of ensuring that we are going to follow through with what we say in regards to building deeply affordable housing and affordable housing. And so with any contract that is written up or what have you, that's what I am looking for, especially. And obviously this will go through a deep community engagement  I do want to applaud AACG for doing great work in regards to connecting with community and really trying to understand and hear the different voices from the different stakeholders and the various groups as well do. And so, you know, I hear that and I understand where you're coming from, Council Member Kalb, in regards to, you know, if city staff is asking for more time. I think that, you know,  This is probably the second or third time that we have come and folks are asking for more time. I think every time the city staff has gone back, the groups have agreed to the set terms. And so at some point we have to get serious because this is land that has been underused and underutilized for decades. And so I think that if we were to make a decision today, then I'm happy to support  making a decision today. But if there is somebody else who would like to make a substitute, I don't know if I would be supportive of that. I think that we need to get moving on this item. So I'll keep it short and just say that. But I want to make sure that we are spelling it out in the language if we move forward with anyone who's trying to utilize the land, whether it's leasing or purchasing or what have you, that we are requiring the deeply affordable and affordable housing on this piece of land.

OAK_11_16_21,SPEAKER_78,"Thank you. So Council Member Fife and I have not yet spoken. Council Member Fife, would you like to speak? Or perhaps while you are considering that, I'll go ahead and share some of my thoughts.  First, I want to just really appreciate both of the project teams, AASCG and the Dave Stewart and Lonnie Murray group for your interests.  and commitment to Oakland and your vision for putting together teams that could just really transform East Oakland and the Coliseum site. It's so rare, and I think we sort of have a good dilemma here with two amazing groups, two Black-owned groups, two groups with a lot of vision and capacity.  The things that are really important to me as we consider developing the Coliseum include the ongoing community engagement leading to a legally enforceable, a binding, a deeply meaningful community benefits agreement. And I am really impressed that AASCG has had  a number of community conversations and has what I understand to be an MOU with a community coalition to move forward with that. I'm also really interested and have a preference of leasing that parcel versus selling it. And affordable housing as this project is developed is really important to me as well.  You know, I understand the staff's concerns. I also feel like this is a moment in time where you know the federal bill was just just move forward there's more opportunity to really push forward and seek funding for open from a range of sources government sources as well as potentially private capital.  And I'd like to see us move forward and move forward confidently as we take this initial step to negotiate. As was said earlier, this would come back to council as a formal development agreement, and there would be time to continue negotiating, continue to get input from the community and other stakeholders, and to get really clear on what the terms would be. So I am potentially ready to make a decision tonight as well.  Okay, Council Member Fife, if you would like to speak, please go ahead.",18836,18986,"""""",Other,Other,0,0
OAK_11_16_21,SPEAKER_85,"Thank you, Chair Bass. And I also agree that there are great opportunities with this particular development.  I guess one of the things that disheartens me the most is that this has come down to Black groups being pit against each other and the negativity that I've seen arise as a result. And I just think that speaks to the lack of development opportunities of this magnitude that exists for Black people who are trying to better their communities. And so I hope with whatever decision that is made this evening, we can figure out how to  utilize some of the stimulus money to support Black  entrepreneurship and Black development and other projects that are also coming up throughout Oakland and make sure that we give folks and honor those attempts to just be involved in this market. Oakland has experienced a great deal of displacement and is seeing a great deal of homelessness and all of the reverberative effects of disinvestment in Black communities. And I hope that this will be a model for how to correct that.  That said, I also have been on the other side of the dais with organizers who are deeply connected to community and the grassroots and have turned out in numbers time and time again in a similar fashion that AASCG has done. I counted at least 30 speakers that were in support of the project tonight, and I said,  If I got the opportunity to do this work, I would listen to the community. And I think it's been very, very apparent that the grassroots organizing has been on the side of AASCG. And I respect that a great deal.  So that said, Madam Chair, I am ready to vote. I have the information that I need to make a decision, and I appreciate everyone that's participated in the process to date.",18988,19115,"""""",Other,Other,0,0

OAK_11_16_21,SPEAKER_57,"So again, essentially, in order for the city to appropriately accept the funds and then be able to use those funds, additional language would be necessary in order to capture that. So the budget office is recommending that these two additional clauses be added to the resolutions.  So the first one essentially stating that the city council would authorize the city administrator to accept and deposit the inappropriate the ENA fee of two hundred thousand per year. And it goes into the actual accounts that it would be deposited into. And that would be for exclusive negotiating fee.  And then the second one is that the similar but it's that it addresses the project expense payment. And in this case, it would be no less than an initial amount of 2.5 million.  And that would be to cover actual staff costs and third party expenses. And again, that's just for the administration and management of the ENA.

So these are edits that would be made to either resolution, whichever resolution council selects tonight. If it does, the language is identical, but this is one item is struck and there's two new further resolved. So I will read those.  In the first further resolved, the phrase, and the city administrator is hereby authorized to accept on behalf of the city of Oakland is struck. And instead, there's a new further resolved that says that the city council authorizes the city administrator to accept, deposit, and appropriate, all of that, the ENA fee of $200,000 per year into entity one miscellaneous capital projects fund  5999 in a project to be determined later for the fee to negotiate exclusively with the city. And be it, and then there's a second new resolved, further resolved that the city council authorizes the city administrator to accept, deposit, and appropriate an initial project expense payment PEP of no less than 2.5 million to cover actual staff costs and third-party expenses into entity one  miscellaneous capital projects fund 5999 in a project to be determined later for the administration and management of the ENA and related project and be it.

OAK_11_16_21,SPEAKER_57,"Okay, so regarding the first question through the chair, what environmental reports will be conducted? And then also with regards to minimizing runoff and those type of associated impacts. So typically throughout the due diligence period that the developer will have,  They will be conducting a number of environmental tests on the property one which is called typically a phase one report where it's mostly work that is done as far as researching.  looking for any potential contaminants on the site. And then there's what they call a phase two environmental report, which involves invasive testing and basically looks at soil conditions. They bore a series of different test holes throughout the property and also look at any concerns regarding any type of contaminants in the groundwater as well.  So attempts will be made to minimize those potential impacts during that process. With regards to the second question for what sort of assistance will be given to schools in the area, those types of conditions will be negotiated as part of the community benefits package. So the developer will be required to submit their plan for assistance  any potential impacts to the surrounding schools and neighborhoods as a result of the future development. And similarly, with regards to traffic impacts, those impacts have been studied in the past through the Coliseum Area Specific Plan. When that specific plan was adopted,  They looked at those potential impacts. And again, any proposed development on the site will need to adhere to those principles of the original specific plan. And it's all predicated on what they consider trip count generation. So as long as it's within the original trip count generation numbers, then it should be within the...  The boundaries of the original specific plan and then with regards to the affordable housing question. There have been different numbers thrown around in terms of what percentage of affordable housing again those numbers will be further negotiated throughout the the ENA process.  And with the hopes of coming back to council at the stage where we can hopefully either recommend an LDDA or DDA since the term sheet would be negotiated throughout the ENA process.  With regards to community access to jobs, that will also be an important component of the community benefits agreement that will be negotiated upon. So there should be some reference to that throughout this process. And then the final question with regards to where the public can find these plans, we would be happy to go ahead and with the approval of the  the developers to be able to post this on the city's website to make this information available to the public.

Thank you for sharing, Council President Bass, that we both worked on an army-based community benefits agreement. And at that time, clearly I was not an elected official, but was responsible for putting town halls together and doing outreach and talking to the community, working with organizations. And it was probably my first major effort that I worked on in the city of Oakland that contained that element of grassroots organizing  And I think if you can win an election, you can do outreach, there are things to do, but also coming to this from being an organizer, there are a myriad of things that can happen to outreach to the community. And over the years that I have been an organizer in Oakland, I've never seen a group  do the level of outreach that AASCG has done. It's something that I've wanted to see, but in terms of a developer, I've never seen this type of outreach to community organizations and agreements with community organizations work in agreements before the projects with organized labor and with different community organizations. So I just...  can't underscore enough how important getting everyday people on board is. And that's something that I hope to see with more projects that come forward from us. And I know with me, when the AASCG group reached out earlier in the year,  They said, now, who should we be talking to? They talked about going door to door and talking to individuals in different communities and going to NCPC meetings and doing all these things. And once again, I have to state that I've never seen this and I'm fairly young-ish and I'm sure that maybe it's happened in the past. I just, it hasn't happened  in my tenure of organizing in the last 25 years. So I just wanted to share that.

So there were many, many things that our honorees shared in terms of how to do that. From my honoree, the Intertribal Friendship House, sharing that with their 66th anniversary, they're doing an auction, which went live today. You can find it on their website. To the Segorité Land Trusts, I don't believe they shared this, but we can also participate in paying the Shumai land tax and contributing to...  the ability for them to reclaim their ancestors.

I wish we did hear more support, but it's great to hear it from an ally. So thank you. I just want to say, you know, it's not a question of which developer was better. The question is, who knows?  Any developer can put a lot of effort into outreach, and that's wonderful. That's great. But those promises don't mean anything. We know that from watching Dave Cavall talk to the CBA committee after two years of making promises the A's don't want to live up to. We know that AASCG is a company. Their bottom line is money. They want to make money. We know that they battled with the Coliseum  for the licensing negotiations. They fought to get all the money from parking, for example. I remember that presentation from the director of the JPA. So I just think council is sort of, you know, issuing its responsibility to be a good arbiter the way public land is disposed of just for,  And I think it's unfortunate because people, thousands of people came to council years ago to make sure that there was some responsibility, some kind of due diligence around the disposition of public land. And those people's efforts meant something. And people really wanted council to stand up for the public's right to have public land be used for public good, not for the benefit of billionaires and rich people. And it's sad to see the most progressive council not do that.  and instead hide behind platitudes and politics. I hope that doesn't become the way things are from now on. It does look like no one's opposing it.",22447,22570,"""""",Public Comment,Commenter,1,0

OAK_11_16_21,SPEAKER_78,"Thank you. And thank you again to everybody who joined us today.  We appreciate everyone's engagement with our city. So we are now going to adjourn the meeting and Madam Clerk, I will take the liberty of leading us in the adjournment. We will be adjourning in memory of the indigenous tribes who were murdered as this country was quote unquote discovered.  In memory of assistant fire chief Sean laughing and also in memory of supervisor loma Chan and i'll share a few words about supervisor Chan and please raise your hand, if you would like to. Also do so before we adjourn I think all of us come are coming together to extend our deepest condolences to the children grandchildren.  friends and colleagues of Supervisor Chan. Still, it's such a great loss and so tragic. Her legacy, her work is an inspiration to everyone in elected office and many everyday people and anyone doing hard work advancing racial and economic justice. And I hope that we can all carry that work forward. She was instrumental and led the efforts in advancing healthcare, childcare, food security,  deportation defense in Alameda County. And as we were starting our meeting, the Board of Supervisors was taking some time to honor her and her son said very beautifully that Supervisor Chan was one of the most virtuous and effective politicians. She had a balanced approach, listened to everyone and was usually the smartest person in the room. She did her work with so much integrity.  And so Wilma Chan, may she rest in peace and in power. Okay, council member called. Please go ahead.",22581,22699,"""""",Other,Other,0,0
OAK_11_16_21,SPEAKER_40,"Thank you, Madam President. And obviously, I concur with all your words. I think so many people, all of us included, are still in shock that this happened so suddenly and tragically. A huge loss for so many people. Of course, most importantly, her family and very dear friends.  More broadly, our entire East Bay community has a tremendous loss. She's irreplaceable, and I wish good luck to the person who ends up replacing her on the Board of Supervisors. In addition to some of the things that you mentioned that she was so engaged in, both during her time as a state legislator in the state assembly,  and as a county supervisor for many, many years. You mentioned health care. Early childhood education was a passion of hers, deep passion of hers. And I also want to add in mental health care. She really was ahead of her time in many regards.  in terms of really pushing to have equity in terms of mental health services be on par with other traditional healthcare services. And she pushed that for so long and she really understood the need for that. So we could all go on and on for an hour to talk about  her amazing accomplishments and her commitment and her passion. But let's just suffice it to say that she'll be deeply missed and our collective hearts go out and to her family, her friends and the entire East Bay will miss her. Thank you, Madam Chair.",22700,22792,"""""",Other,Other,0,0

OAK_11_16_21,SPEAKER_60,"Thank you so much, Madam President, and thank you for leading us in this important acknowledgement of the incredible life and legacy and dedication of Supervisor Wilma Chan. In addition to what has already been said, I think she was one of the most thoughtful, dedicated, and kind elected officials.  in our region. And I also think it's important to acknowledge the way that she held a variety of different positions and so looked at this role in public service as someone who served on the Oakland School Board, who served on the County Board of Supervisors, who went to Sacramento, was Majority Leader in the State Assembly, and then  came back and was supervisor again. And so has had this vantage point on public service from smaller seats to larger seats and then continuing that dedication yet again. And one of the things that she particularly uplifted that I think is so important is really believing in public service and believing in government services for the public.  And in an era that has taken over since Reagan of this push for privatization and to decimate government services in the name of making it small enough to drown in a bathtub, Supervisor Wilma Chan always stood up for protecting, enhancing, insourcing, and supporting vital public services, including in the vital field of health care.  And may we all continue that work and continue to uplift the vital needs of the most vulnerable that she fought for. Thank you. Thank you, Madam President.",22798,22905,"""""",Other,Other,0,0

OAK_11_16_21,SPEAKER_32,"Thank you. Yes, I wanted to similarly express my sort of just deep condolences to her family and those who have been impacted by her loss. Supervisor Chan was someone who I definitely was in awe of.  in her leadership, how she showed up, how she stayed sort of true to center in her various interactions. I know she was very no nonsense. The boards that I was able to serve on with her, she definitely set a, I will say, a standard of getting things done above all else and sort of putting away with  the other things that we can get distracted by in service. And so her record speaks for itself, her as a champion, as not just a pioneer, but a champion for those who did not have representation and were not at the table to fight for themselves. So just sort of reflecting on her life, her legacy, and wishing that I had more time to learn from her.  given all that we've heard around how she has been in so many different parts of the government, been involved in so many different things that have been foundational for the lives of those here in Alameda County.

OAK_11_16_21,SPEAKER_71,"Thank you, Council President. I just want to say that, you know, even as a staffer, I've gotten to know  Wilma and, you know, as folks have said, she was no nonsense. You know, her ultimate goal in life and was to serve the public and serve the people make sure that she was being the voice of those who are most marginalized and  underheard and underserved. And that's what she lived by. She was a person who when she saw a problem, she addressed it and she acknowledged it, facing it head on. And that was something that I really admired about her. And in our last conversation that we had, we were planning a coffee meeting, just to talk about that kind of leadership, you know, and she was a friend of mine, a mentor and has broken so many of this glass ceiling and in the API community, we  call it these bamboo ceilings that we have within our API communities. And she really acknowledged the fact that within the API community, we are different. Southeast Asians are a lot different in regards to where they're at in society and socioeconomic status and what have you. And not just that, but she cared so much about our seniors as well, ensuring that folks had the healthcare that they needed and the resources that they needed. And so  You know, she's leaving a legacy behind, and it's really sad to see that or to know that she's gone. But, you know, like Councilmember Kolb said, you know, her shoes are huge, and whoever is going to fill them next will have a huge job to tackle. But, you know, just grateful for the time that we did have for her leadership, and we've had her leadership for many, many years, and we are better because of it.

We have certainly been praying for them personally, as family friends, for the family, for loved ones, and so many of us in the community who have been impacted by just the tragic loss of Supervisor Chan. I've shared that she's been just an amazing trailblazer.  She has just been dedicated to what I value as public service over politics and the politics of politics. I've always valued her feedback, her wise counsel, her guidance. I worked alongside her son as a peer in similar roles, but two different companies over the last five years and have gone from knowing the family more through her growing up  and having the opportunity to get to know the family through her son in a different way. So just want to continue to hopefully have my life reflect just the fierce fight that I saw her in advancing solutions that strengthen our community, that really prioritize community and the voice of community and just doing the right thing.",23122,23199,"""""",Other,Other,0,0
