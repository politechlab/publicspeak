Colleagues, at this time, we will open the remote public comment period for items on the city council agenda, introduction and referral calendar, and the council's work program. I want to thank everyone for their ongoing patience as we continue to operate this remote public comment system. It remains our strong intent.  to continue to have public comment at all of our council meetings. And as a reminder, the city council does reserve the right to end or eliminate these public comment periods at any point if we deem that the system is being abused or is no longer suitable for allowing our meetings to be conducted efficiently.  And effectively, I'll moderate the public comment period in the following manner. Public comment period for today is 20 minutes. Each speaker will be given two minutes to speak. Speakers are called upon in the order in which they registered to provide public comment on the council's website. Each speaker must call in from the phone number used for this registration and using the meeting phone number, ID and passcode that was emailed to them upon confirmation. This is different.  This is different than the general meeting, listen line, call in information. Again, I'll call in each speaker by name and in the order in which they registered on the council's website. If you've not yet registered to speak, but would like to, you can sign up before the end of public comment by going to council's website at seattle.gov forward slash council.  Public comment link is also listed on today's agenda. Once I call your name, staff will unmute you. You are gonna hear the prompt of you have been unmuted, and that'll be your cue to press star six before you can begin speaking. Please begin by stating your name, the item you are addressing, and as a reminder, your comment should relate to an item on today's agenda, the introduction and referral calendar, or the council's work program.  You're going to hear a chime at about 10 seconds. That means you've got 10 seconds left of your allotted time. I'd ask that you begin wrapping up your public comment. If you don't end your comments at that allotted time, then your microphone is going to be muted so we can call on the next speaker. Once you've completed your public comment, we ask that you please disconnect from the line. And if you plan to continue following this meeting, you can do so on Seattle Channel or one of the listening options listed on the agenda.  Public comment period is now open. Again, we're going to start with the first speaker. After you hear the prompt, if you have been unmuted, please remember to press star six in order to unmute yourself. Okay.

SEA_10_11_21,SPEAKER_05,"Good afternoon. Howard Gale, District 7, speaking on failed police accountability.  Around one-third of SPD officers remain unvaccinated. According to the Officer Down Memorial page, in 2020, 65% of police line of duty deaths were from COVID. That is over five times as many as were killed by gunfire, knife, and assault combined. So police can kill a person because of an imaginary fear, but they refuse to protect themselves or the public from a very real and a very deadly fear.  This makes clear that police culture is so imbued with irrational fears and bias that policy and training will have little effect on it. There is only accountability, something the council has abandoned. For the first time in decades, council members will have to face the consequences of the bullying, antisocial, and transience that imbues police culture. That bullying, antisocial, and transience killed Charlena Lyles, Terry Kaver, Derek Hayden, and many of the dozens killed by the SPD since the start of federal oversight nearly a decade ago.  That bullying, antisocial, and transients severely injured and curtailed the rights of hundreds of protesters last year. That bullying, antisocial, and transients allowed SBB officers to escape accountability, guaranteeing a repeat. These are consequences of failed accountability. Now council members, having escaped all these consequences as they relax comfortably in their homes or offices, must face this bullying, antisocial, and transients head on,  The Seattle officers dare you to fire them as they maintain an anti-vaccination stance as a clear expression of underlying extreme right-wing beliefs and bias. But SBD officers warned you of this in February 2020 when they, many of whom were younger officers, voted in a landslide election for the right-wing nationalist provocateur Mike Solon to head their union, the only union of city workers refusing to come to terms with a vaccine mandate.

I'm a renter in First Hill, and I'm an organizer with Socialist Alternative, and I'm calling to support Councilmember Shana Sawant's legislation to make construction contractor boxes  fully pay 100% of all parking costs for all construction workers on Seattle job sites. And I'm calling on you to stand with construction workers in Seattle, not with the contractor bosses, by voting in support of this basic need for the thousands of workers who build our city. Carpenters and other construction workers are required to drive to job sites with vehicles loaded with tools, harnesses,  other equipment required for the job, but often have to pay $100 or more a week for parking. And that works out to thousands of dollars a year that construction workers have to pay just to go to work. I've been working in food service for most of my life. And one time that I did work downtown, I got paid parking at somebody who worked at a small bakery. And if that small bakery can afford it, these big construction corporations who  are making millions of dollars every year can absolutely afford it, especially when it's not an option to take public transit for these construction workers, right? And most construction workers are forced to drive in and park from outside of Seattle because they can't afford to live in the buildings that they themselves build. And this is because the cost of living is so high, especially with the lack of affordable housing and sky-high rents. So, you know,  This is something that the workers are demanding. The community is with them, and I really urge council members to support Councilmember Sawant's legislation. I don't want to hear any excuses about how this isn't something that the council can do. The council can act today without delays, without watering down, and the council must stand with construction workers and not with the millionaire bosses.",366,480,"""""",Public Comment,Commenter,1,0

I'm calling to support Chama Sawant's bill to make the contractor bosses pay for 100% of parking costs for construction workers on all Seattle job sites. It was a requirement actually when I joined my union's apprenticeship that I provide proof of car ownership because public transit is frequently not an option for building trades workers. So even when it is an option to commute into the city from the more affordable communities that construction workers are often from,  you know, far outside of the city, taking public transit doubles or triples the amount of time to and from work. And that's if it's even an option. So one day I might work in South Lake Union, the next day in Pioneer Square, sometimes both in one day. And, you know, when I've got a tool belt and bucket, hard hat, welding hood, lunchbox, rain gear, safety harness and so on, loading that onto a city bus, you know, just isn't  isn't a realistic expectation. And this is certainly not pleasant for anyone, not for me, not for, you know, the other workers taking public transit. And, you know, some of you have said that you support my sisters and brothers in the Carpenters Union while they're on strike against greedy contractors who don't want to pay for benefits and family wages. And, you know, this is a primary demand from the rank and file, you know, to have the bosses pay for parking. So, you know, and carpenter leadership has said that the issue of parking should be handled through legislation  Well, here's your chance to walk the walk. The choice is clear. Right now, workers shell out 20 to 30 bucks a day. We're demanding that the employers that profit off of our labor cover that cost rather than being taxed an hour of our wages every day. So I urge the other eight city council members to pass council members who want legislation to require the bosses pay this cost of doing business rather than my sisters and brothers have to pay just to go to work. So no loopholes, no watering down, contractor paid parking 100%.",504,619,"""""",Public Comment,Commenter,1,0

I'm a working mom in District 3 and a landlord, and I'm calling in support of the bill put forward by Councilmember Seamus Sawant to make construction contractor bosses pay 100% of all parking costs for all construction workers on Seattle job sites. As Dan mentioned earlier, if a small bakery can pay for it, so can they.  And as we've also heard from others, the carpenters, the builders can't even and workers can't even live in Seattle because an average home price is now over $800,000 and $2,300 a month for rent. And obviously they cannot ride the bus because they're hauling in all kinds of equipment and the buses don't even operate that early.  And I have to say, I never knew that construction workers had to pay for parking since they're the ones building our city. I thought they could park wherever they wanted and needed to for their jobs. I guess that's naive. But this strike by the brave carpenters and workers is really highlighting this issue for me and more people need to know about this. So please, I'm asking you to pass this legislation as soon as possible without loopholes. As the COVID pandemic continues wreaking havoc on our economy,  The U.S. billionaires have gotten $1.8 trillion richer, and globally billionaires are $10.2 billion richer than they were at the start of the pandemic.

And also to cut Mayor Durkan's proposed $13 million increase to the already bloated police budget so we can instead fund housing and affordable services for working class people, as well as cutting the $650,000 expansion to the do-nothing officer of the Inspector General.  I'm also calling to urge council members to stand with construction workers in Seattle by voting in support of council member Salwan's legislation that would make construction contractors fully pay for 100% of all parking costs for construction workers on Seattle job sites. I signed a petition along with over a thousand union and non-union workers supporting this common sense legislation because no one should have to pay to work. This would also allow unions to focus on bargaining for higher wages and benefits other than having to fight just to cover parking costs for their members.  But paying for your employees' parking should be a basic cost of doing business in Seattle. If you're a contractor who's making millions hiring workers to build luxury towers or to build a convention center or arenas, other massive buildings in the city, then you can absolutely afford to pay for the parking that thousands of workers who are actually doing the work every day but can't afford to live here.

Carpenters and other construction workers are required to drive to job sites with vehicles loaded with tools, harnesses, other equipment, but often have to pay $100 or more a week for parking. I heard from a construction worker this morning, he said that sometimes they're paying over $500 a month just to park to go to work. That works out to obviously thousands of dollars a year that construction workers have to pay just for working. Due to demands of their jobs, construction workers have to drive there.  They have a lot of equipment, as I already mentioned, and as you've already heard, to bring to the job sites and must show up before the crack of dawn, before public transit is even available to them. Most construction workers are forced to drive in from outside of the city of Seattle because they can't afford to live in the buildings that they themselves are building. This is because the cost of living is so high, especially with the lack of affordable housing and sky-high rents. Average home prices are over $800,000 in Seattle and over $2,300 a month for a single-bedroom apartment.  Rents have risen over more than 25% just since the start of this year.

And they spend even less time with their families because they spend so much time on the road as it is because they're forced to drive in our horrific traffic. So the least you Democrats who say that you're pro-labor can do is make sure that they don't have to pay an extra $500 a month out of their own pocket just to have to go to work.  This will help the carpenters who are in the middle of a strike. This will help non-union workers who are stuck paying these costs with their lower wages. They make even less than we do. So we need to help non-union people if we're pro-labor, which I heard from Democrats that they say they're pro-labor, but I'd really like to see it with my own eyes.  This will help all of the people who can't afford to live in the city that they build. This will take it off of our bargaining committee's plate.

I am the sponsor of this bill, so I'll address it first and then open the floor to comments. But before we actually debate the underlying bill, I did want to move  the adoption of the amendment. I did have an opportunity to speak about the amendment this morning, and it was published on the agenda. It is Amendment A. Pardon.

Is there a second? Second. Second.  Thank you. It's been moved and seconded to amend the bill as presented on Amendment A.

As it relates to the items addressed in this legislation, the city last week reached a new tentative agreement with Protect 17, representing the Central Staff Analyst Bargaining Unit,  Amendment A, which is currently before us, would attach this new tentative agreement to the council bill so that it would be ratified along with the other agreements already included in the legislation that was transmitted to us by the executive branch. This tentative agreement includes the same terms and benefits as the other agreements that were attached to this bill as it was transmitted, and the late addition of this agreement is simply the result of sequencing  Since the executive-led negotiations in city unions did not initially include the central staff analyst bargaining unit, this agreement is ready now to be attached to this legislation now that those negotiations have occurred and have been completed. So I'm happy to answer any questions about Amendment A, but of course I do recommend that my colleagues support the adoption of Amendment A. Any questions or comments on Amendment A?

And I'm gonna go ahead and make comments on the amended bill before opening it up to any further debate.  Again, Council Bill 120186, as amended, includes terms for frontline worker pay that are authorized by this Council bill, that would be authorized by this Council bill if approved. So the terms in this bill were negotiated with various unions.  Representing city employees and the benefits provided therein will apply to both represented and nonrepresented frontline workers employed by all three branches of city government, including the legislative branch. Following the adoption of Amendment A, which we just did, this legislation would ratify four tentative agreements with all the bargaining units who have agreed to these terms. This frontline worker pay will go to eligible employees in the form of a lump sum payment  of up to a maximum of $1,750. This is comparable to the total value of the telework stipends that have been paid to city employees who have been working virtually throughout the pandemic. So generally speaking, city workers are eligible for either the telework stipend or the frontline worker pay and cannot earn both benefits.  The estimated cost for additional paid to represented and nonrepresented frontline workers is approximately $6.5 million. And there are sufficient reserves in the general fund needed to support this additional expense.  I do want to make sure that members of the viewing public and colleagues know that future legislation will have to come before the council later this year or early next year to make appropriations to various city departments in order for them to execute the lump sum payments to eligible employees once we have a better sense of the full universe of those who will claim it.  Finally, as I noted during this morning's council briefing, the city has now reached tentative agreements regarding frontline worker pay with all unions representing city employees, with the exception of the Seattle Police Officers Guild. The Seattle Police Officers Guild was offered the same terms and benefits agreed to by all other unions, but has so far rejected the city's proposed terms. Of course, we are disappointed in that rejection, but  but we'll continue to move through our processes here to make sure that the frontline workers who are complying with vaccine requirements and who are also frontline workers and agreeing to accept these terms are compensated accordingly.  Okay, folks, I don't have anything else to say on this particular issue, so I'm going to go ahead and wrap up my comments and open up the floor to any additional comments on Council Bill 120186.

And I wish more folks could have been here from our coalition, could have been here today, but like everybody else, they're busy juggling multiple things. So I'm here to say on behalf of our over 30 member organizations that serve survivors of domestic and sexual violence,  in King County that we want to sincerely thank you and  express our appreciation for you taking the time with everything else that's going on to declare October 21st, 2021 to be Gender-Based Violence Provider Recognition Day. Right now, right in the middle of Domestic Violence Awareness Month. And I also wanna say thank you for all of your long-term continued efforts to inspire awareness and action on this critical issue.  none of you are strangers to this issue. So thank you all to council members and other folks behind making this happen. And I know that you're all far too familiar with how significant the problem of domestic and sexual violence are in our community, how they're connected to housing, homelessness, physical and mental illness, the other crises that are  taking up so much of your time. And I know you know that services were never adequately, you know, had adequate capacity and that's all changed. But there'll be time to talk about all of those problems and needs at future meetings, I promise you. But today we're focusing on  Celebrating, you know, they're really talented and committed providers of gender-based violence services working both inside and outside of formal systems to meet the needs of survivors.  And I just feel so, I've been so impressed by seeing the tenacity, resilience, creativity, and dedication of the folks on the front lines, supporting survivors through this issue and also working with their communities to respond.  You know, advocates and preventionists kept showing up over the past now almost two years, despite the ongoing pandemic and all of its effects, having to pivot services, adapt them again, readapt them again.  try to figure out how to keep themselves and their families safe while also trying to provide safety and support to folks, you know, survivors facing really, really difficult situations.  They've been working hard to stay engaged with communities, to stay engaged with some, you know, all of the really, really critical and needed conversations we're having in our communities around racial justice, around the need to really re-  re-envision and transform our community, our systems of accountability and support, particularly with an attention to racial and gender justice. And holding the complexity of all of the, sometimes it seems like just paradoxical situations that we've said before, that like we know that  Criminal legal systems are not gonna end gender-based violence. And we also know that until we have the supportive and just communities that we want, some survivors will end up having to turn it to that system or engaged in it in some kind of way. So at least for some temporary safety.  and harm reduction. So one thing that this past year and a half has taught me is just the importance of  taking time to focus on gratitude, and it's almost like a platitude, but really just to remember to recognize and celebrate the resilience of our communities and of the folks working to support people having a hard time. And I just also have such gratitude for living somewhere where there are so many engaged and committed community leaders and public officials such as yourselves.  who really support and are working to transform our communities to places where safe and just relationships can thrive. You all have significant influence in your offices, and we really thank you for using that opportunity  power to recognize gender-based violence providers and inspire action today and every day of the year.

SEA_10_18_21,SPEAKER_00,"These three appointments are the confirmations of three appointments to the Seattle Renters Commission, or more accurately, the City of Seattle Renters Commission. Typically, those appointments would first be considered by the Sustainability and Renters Rights Committee, which my office chairs. However, because committee meetings are on a hold because of the budget deliberations, we are referring the appointments directly to the City Council.  as I earlier hoped the council would do with the bill for construction worker parking costs so that the new members of the Seattle City of Seattle Renters Commission can be in place in time to attend the November 1st meeting of the Renters Commission we heard from  Mack McGregor from the Renters Commission. Thank you, Mack, for testifying as to how you're having trouble filling in the meetings. And this is important work. And my office as chair of the Sustainability and Renters Rights Committee and also the mayor's office were contacted by the Renters Commission because they have accumulated several vacancies.  and are currently having difficulty reaching quorum. Council members may remember that the committee filled all the council-appointed positions on the commission over the summer, but there have been five positions that the mayor is responsible for appointing that have been vacant for an unusually long time. In addition, there is a council-appointed position that was newly vacated over the summer, in addition to two recently vacated commission-appointed positions.  The Renters' Commission took proactive steps to help fill the vacant positions. They advertised the openings, received many applications, conducted interviews, and made recommendations for filling all eight vacant positions. As chair of the Sustainability and Renters' Rights Committee, I've moved the appointment of Haley Friedland, the Commission's recommendation of the council-appointed position,  and the appointments of Ariana Laureano and Rachel Sanchez, the two commission-appointed positions, and those are the three that are on today's city council meeting agenda for a vote. Hayley Friedland is an artist, a trombonist, who, like many artists, finds it more and more difficult to have an affordable apartment every time they move inside our city. Ariana Laureano is a disability rights activist  who fights for renters' rights, and Rachel Sanchez works for a nonprofit supporting low-income families. Unfortunately, even though the commission also recommended candidates for the mayor-appointed positions, we continue to wait for Mayor Durkan to make those appointments, which actually literally just requires signing her name to the appointment packets that the commission has already prepared for her. As I mentioned during the council briefing, I urged the mayor to fill those five positions of the renters' commission.  We have seen the Renters Commission play a tremendous role fighting for renters' rights over the last several years. They brought the recommendation to the city council, which then passed the bill sponsored from my office, increasing the notice landlords must give renters for rent increases to six months. This is absolutely landmark legislation, and it would not have been possible without the work  of the renters commission and similarly their work is uh has been indispensable in winning many other renters rights bills that we have won this year with five mayor controlled vacancies it leaves very small margins for quorum on a 15 commission it is a volunteer board and if only three people are absent for a meeting suddenly they do not have quorum because there are so many vacant positions mayoral positions the mayor makes an appointment the next two weeks i will do what it can  What can be done to support placing those appointments on the city council agenda for November 1st so that the commission can be fully staffed for their November renters commission meeting? And I appreciate the staff in the mayor's office coordinating with our office, but we need action from Mayor Durkan, and we are looking forward to that. But today we have the three positions up for a vote appointed by council and by the commission, and I hope council members will support these appointments.

SEA_10_18_21,SPEAKER_08,"Aye. All in favor, none opposed. Thank you so much. The motion carries and the appointments are confirmed. Is there any further business to come before the council? Looking for hands raised.  Okay, I don't see any hands raised. So colleagues, this does conclude the items of business on today's agenda. As a reminder, the city council is deliberating. The mayor's proposed 2022 budget and committee meetings are suspended until the adoption of the budget, unless the budget chair and council president agree otherwise, which is done only in very narrow circumstances. As I mentioned during this morning's council briefing, with committee meetings suspended, it appears that our next regular meeting, which is scheduled for October 25th, will not have any committee reports for our consideration as a full council.  And there doesn't seem to be any other pressing legislative matters coming our way for consideration on that Monday, October 25.  So as a result, it may be the case that I decide to cancel that October 25th meeting to allow the council and our legislative department staff to remain focused on the preparations related to the select budget committee meetings scheduled throughout that week. Again, please let my office know by emailing me and my deputy chief of staff, Cody Ryder, by no later than 5 p.m. today.  If there are any pending items that do require attention at the city council meeting currently scheduled for Monday, October 25th. If we do not receive an objection by 5 p.m. today, then I will cancel the city council meeting on October 25th. And our next city council meeting would then occur on November 1st, 2021 at 2 o'clock p.m. Please keep in mind that the cancellation would only apply to the city council meeting at 2 p.m.  We would still convene at 9.30 a.m. as a full council on October 25th for a regularly scheduled council briefing meeting. So with that being said, I hope that you all have a wonderful afternoon. Thank you so much for your work. We are adjourned.",3393,3509,"""""",Other,Other,0,0
