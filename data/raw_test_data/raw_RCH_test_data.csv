We've had many conversations and meetings on this topic, so I won't belabor, but I will simply state that the amendment before you outlines our proposed allocation of roughly $77.5 million from the federal government at the first half of the total ARPA funding of $155 million allotted to the city.  This plan was developed in close collaboration with City Council, leveraging the input provided by over 3,200 citizens over two phases of engagement about the spending plan. We believe this funding is an opportunity for transformational change and that this amendment delivers on that promise with investments in people, programs, and places that will help our city recover and continue to thrive. The spending proposal includes $32 million to build back affordable and healthy homes, including $20 million for the Affordable Housing Trust Fund.  Beating the goal established in the equity agenda and supported by city council four years ahead of schedule. Includes 5 million for a health equity fund, health equity trust fund managed by the Richmond City Health District through an MOU that will be developed with the city. The fund will support ongoing COVID-19 response, maternal and infant health, food access, mental behavioral health, and more. And finally, as well as $81 million invested in children and families. Residents top priority in the first round of public engagement.  with $2 million directed for childcare and 78 million for funding community centers, including T.B. Smith, Southside Community Center, Calhoun Center, and a new center at the current site of Luxfield. The plan also includes $19 million to plan for and address climate and environmental changes in the city and $8.5 million investment in public safety and 5.9 million in economic supports.

I stand here tonight, not only as the interim CEO for the Richmond Redevelopment Housing Authority, but also as a member of the community that is concerned about the health and wellbeing of our public housing families and communities. For this reason, I'm advocating for funding for the Calhoun Family Investment Center, the Creighton Court Transformation and the Highland Grove Development Project. For the Calhoun Center,  As a part of the fabric of Gilpin Court and the greater Richmond community for some 50 years, funding the Calhoun Family Investment Center will have both an immediate and long-term positive and empowering impacts on the community.  Critical programs are needed for Calhoun for our youth, particularly our youth that ranges in, for our males that ranges in the ages of 14 to 18, as well as our seniors, and particularly every age group in between the males, as well as our seniors. This is not just an investment of money, but an investment of life, the restoration of life, the recitation of a community that has been overlooked and neglected.  The Calhoun Family Investment Center can be the beacon of light it once was. We can see to that. Creighton Court. Creighton Court is one of the Richmond's oldest public housing developments. Plans for its transformation began more than 10, excuse me, more than a decade ago. Through a series of fits and starts, the realization of this transformation is finally happening, is truly finally happening.  Funding will ensure that new beginning for Creighton families becomes a reality. And that hundreds more are able to take advantage of affordable housing opportunities right here in the city of Richmond in the East End. And lastly, but not least Highland Grove. This vibrant mixed income community has served as a catalyst for revitalization in North Highland Park.  The current 128 apartment homes that are here today will soon be joined by 122 single family homes built for first-time homeowners. More affordable housing for the families of Richmond. It may be easy to look at each of these projects as just another development, but they are not, they are opportunities. Opportunities that represent renewal, community growth and development and investment in safe, walkable neighborhoods  children's playgrounds, libraries, community gardens, parks, as well as senior aerobic classes. All the things that make a community thrive. It is central to RHA's mission, but we can't do it alone. As they say, it takes a village, but it takes a village to build a community.

RCH_10_25_21,SPEAKER_02,"Hello, everyone. My name is Mike Kometic. I'm the president of a local organization called New Era Richmond. I just wanted to come and say I appreciate the initiative that's being taken to address a lot of the gun violence in the city through creating community centers, a variety of other different things. I work with a lot of youth in the city, work with Ms. Cummings also, who is speaking up here. I also work with RIT as well. So I work on both ends to try and  get some, make some sense of what's going on in the city and try and get some things for these youth to do. One thing I do want to say that is a bit of a criticism is that a lot of the items that are on that sheet seem like they should be able to be done during the normal budgeting process. The ARPA funds were supposed to be able to establish a new economic base for the city in some kind of way so that we can recover from what is going on. A lot of the things that are in there, you guys should be able to do that without spending the ARPA funds on.  And what the ARPA funds should be done for is to be able to do things that establish an economic base where businesses can come in, companies can come in and be able to establish themselves and be able to provide jobs for the people in a non-predatory way. When the city council doesn't take the initiative to do those things, you leave the city open to predators. They come in offering things to the city, but not in the city's best interest.  One of the main things that probably could have been done in this situation was clear out the Coliseum, make that space ready for building upon. So that's inviting to any type of corporation that wants to come in. They have the ground foundation for them to be able to come in, be able to bring jobs that don't rely on a casino. They don't rely on taking money from people and being able to pay people. So I will say that most of the things in there are good. It's just that you guys should be able to do half that stuff without having to offer funds.  I do appreciate the things that you did put them towards.

My name is Bryce Robertson, and I'm an unpaid volunteer with the organization Richmond Together, and we appreciate the opportunity to comment on the city's American Rescue Plan proposal.  Richmond Together is a group of concerned citizens deeply committed to supporting bold policy change over the next decade within a racial equity and community wealth building framework. We have been closely following and participating in the development of the plan, and we want to commend city council and the mayor's office for the leadership they've shown in addressing these complex challenges. We also want to thank the public and the many Richmonders who participated in the citizen engagement process.  OUR OVERALL VIEW OF THE PLAN IS FAVORABLE AND WE SUPPORT ITS ADOPTION. WE ARE GRATIFIED THAT SEVERAL OF OUR OWN RECOMMENDATIONS ARE INCLUDED, MOST NOTABLY THE CREATION OF A $5 MILLION HEALTH EQUITY FUND THAT WOULD ALLOW THE RICHMOND CITY HEALTH DISTRICT TO TACKLE INEQUITIES OVER THE LONG TERM.

SO HOW WILL THESE FUNDS BE USED? IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THESE QUESTIONS BE ANSWERED AND DEVELOPED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE WITHOUT THAT, IT'S HARD TO ASSESS WHAT THEIR TRUE PURPOSE AND POTENTIAL ARE.  While the $1.5 million allocated to workforce development and community ambassador programs is helpful, it's not nearly enough to take advantage of this incredible opportunity that we do have with this funding coming our way. New policies like the child tax credit are going to offer thousands of Richmond families the opportunity to escape poverty. What's missing is an adequate funding proposal for  FOR WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT, AND WE MUST QUICKLY FIND SOME ANSWERS TO THAT. I ALSO WANT TO LIFT UP THAT IT MIGHT BE NOW THE TIME TO REALLY IMPROVE THE SYSTEMS THAT THE CITY IS USING IN TERMS OF TECHNOLOGY, BECAUSE IN SOME WAYS IT'S STILL HURTING OUR COMMUNITY IN TRYING TO ACCESS WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THE CITY AND IT'S HARMING PEOPLE.

Joining me virtually are about 100 risk members representing our 23 congregations watching online together.  There are 25,000 families in this city that cannot find a safe, decent and affordable place to call home. And because they cannot afford the rent, thousands in our community get evicted each year. And if you have an eviction on your record, your ability to get housing has just been made horribly worse. These people are suffering.  Our 23 congregations have just concluded six weeks of house meetings where hundreds gathered in small groups and shared stories about how their lives have been impacted by the severe lack of affordable housing. Some of these stories we heard were awful.  We have a member at Fourth Baptist who is working with the lady who came to the church needing help, trying to find a place to live. She can't find a place. Our member is trying to help her, but when she called places, the prices were outrageous. Others talked about being locked out of communities because of the extremely high cost of housing.  We need help now.

I'm a risk team leader at St. Elizabeth, and I represent about 100 risk members who are gathered on Zoom and watching right now. As a risk team leader, I hosted a house meeting a couple weeks ago, and at our house meetings, we gather together to share stories about community problems and later organize around these issues  To find winnable solutions to them, I was given permission by a gentleman who attended my house meeting to share his family story with you all tonight. So this gentleman shared that he's been struggling tremendously and trying to find affordable housing for him and his family. He has a wife and five children. His oldest is 18, his youngest is two. They are a refugee family and found an apartment about two years ago. They paid their rent on time every month for about a year. During this time,  There was an accident at the apartment in which they were charged $4,000 in repairs. They were already struggling to do their best to pay rent, but still managed to get on a payment plan, pay the entire $4,000, and all the while never missing a payment or being late. At the end of their lease, the landlord decided not to renew their lease despite their incredible payment history. They fought it knowing how difficult it would be to find another affordable place to stay.  So they went to court and the courts ruled against them. They were evicted with an eviction now on their record. It was impossible for them to find a place. They ended up homeless, sleeping at Walmart sometimes or any place that they could find safe enough for the family. A two year old slept outside. Having a 20 month old and three year old of my own. This is heartbreaking. It's scary. It's unfathomable.  They were finally able to find shelter in a motel room. For about a year, seven people stayed in one room. It was close to a bar, so this gentleman feared for the safety of his wife and children. Sometimes drunken strangers would come in the middle of the night, urinate in front of their door. During the year in the motel, their 18-year-old daughter went from being an A student to failing all of her classes. For these conditions, this family spent over $40,000 in a year.  So we've come today to urge you to allocate 20 million from the American Rescue Plan dollars to the Affordable Housing Trust Fund.

RCH_10_25_21,SPEAKER_00,"Okay. Good evening. I'm Martin Wegbright, risk member and city council's appointee to the Affordable Housing Trust Fund Oversight Board. I represent 100 risk members watching online together. Richmond has an eviction crisis. 95% of evictions are caused by nonpayment of rent, which is caused by rent burden. 51% of Richmond tenants are rent burdened and spend over 30% of their income on housing.  with 21% spending over 50%. Rent burden is caused by the lack of affordable housing, with a shortage of 25,000 affordable rental units for tenants at or below 30% of area median income. Lack of affordable housing causes evictions, a third to a half of which are suffered by those who are at or below 30% of area median income.  No problem in Richmond affects more people more seriously in more areas of their lives than evictions. Every eviction judgment leaves a scar on a tenant's record that lasts for 10 years. After an eviction judgment, the tenant family almost certainly will live in a worse house, in worse conditions, in a worse neighborhood, going to a worse school. Eviction is the social problem hiding in plain sight.  Richmond must change from a leader in evictions to a leader in eviction reduction. Housing is the vaccine for poverty. It is long past time to administer that vaccine. To begin to solve this problem, a minimum of $10 million a year is needed for the Affordable Housing Trust Fund, according to national experts consulted by RISC 11 years ago. Yet over the last four fiscal years,  Richmond spent slightly less than that. A quarter solution is no solution at all. Richmond now has a once-in-a-generation opportunity to transform this city. Due to the American Rescue Plan, Richmond has $77 million in two budget years to allocate without great restrictions.  To pass up this opportunity to transform housing in Richmond and launch the city on a path to seriously tackle the most pervasive problem the city faces would be tragic. The Affordable Housing Trust Fund is doing its part. RISC asks the City Council to do your part by approving an additional $10 million a year for the next two years for affordable housing, with half of the funds devoted to developing housing for those at or below  30% of area median income.

I represent 100 RISC members watching virtually tonight here to show our support for the allocation of $20 million to the Affordable Housing Trust Fund over the next two years. As you all follow through on your word to support this housing money tonight, I want to remind us all that the ultimate goal is to make a substantial difference in the lives of our neighbors most in need.  This money will change the lives of so many Richmonders struggling to keep a roof over their heads and provide a safe place to learn and grow for their children. By designating these funds to leverage for important housing investments in Richmond, this is only the first step. Our next step must be to ensure that the investments we make are targeted where they are most needed. Half of the funds in the Affordable Housing Trust Fund should be allocated towards the creation  of units for those making 30% of the average median income and below. It is poor stewardship of the funds that have been entrusted to the city council if you do not prioritize projects that could make the biggest positive difference for the people of our city. Some have said that it simply cannot be done, but that is false. Yes, building housing for the lowest income levels presents unique challenges.  But true leaders do not let challenges get in the way of doing what is right and what is necessary. RISC hosted an affordable housing roundtable last February where we convened experts, developers, and experienced staff from other cities to share the tools and strategies that they have used to achieve these same goals. I know all of you have received the full recording of that event and the important resources that were shared.  we can and must rise to this challenge. If we allocate these $20 million and don't use them to solve the problem of truly affordable housing, then we have squandered a once in a generation opportunity. So we have come today not only to urge you to approve the allocation of 20 million from the American Rescue Plan dollars to the Affordable Housing Trust Fund, but also to urge you to use this 20 million where it's needed most by far.  not on 80% AMI, not on 60% AMI, but on those households earning the least amount of money.

I'm the president and CEO of Caritas. First, I want to thank Ms. Trammell and the rest of City Council for supporting the development of the Caritas Center, which is now our new home in the 8th District, a $28 million investment. But even with our new home, we struggle to find new homes for those in our emergency shelter.  There was a time, and I've been there 21 years, so it has been a while, that our average length of stay in our emergency shelter was 10 to 15 days, and those days are long gone. Our average length of stay now in a 30-day shelter is a minimum of six months. We have added two housing navigators and a housing resource coordinator to help with the enormous challenges of finding solutions for those in our shelter.  An example is Miss Annabel, a woman with a traumatic brain injury, a fixed income, and found herself unfortunately in an emergency shelter. It took nine months to get out of the Caritas shelter and find a place to be in permanent supportive housing with Virginia Supportive Housing.  so i am just urging you tonight because of the work that i do and the the fact that i see this i see the problems caused by the the lack of affordable housing every day in our new home i'm just urging you to put the 20 million dollars from the arpa funds into the affordable housing trust  and target those for creating units for the people most in need, the people in the Caritas shelter, those that are homeless, those that are facing homelessness, and those that are the most vulnerable in our community.

Smith Community Center last Friday, and some of the citizens were able to be out there, and their community members, leaders, and also some of the business owners came out there to praise the mayor for doing something for that area that has been neglected for so many years. The T.V. Smith Community Center is gonna be like a brand new community center that's gonna provide a lot of city services to,  And the mayor even spoke about, and also Chris was there with us. And we talked about like a little miniature mini hall for that to be there. So that's something that the citizens were definitely grateful for. Also a drive-through window, because we know that things have changed since COVID. And a lot of people are not able to, or do not want to be in the banks where there's a large amount of people. So if we had like a drive-through window, they could do like their,  city services through the window. And also the mayor talked about all kinds of new activity. And also I want to say that the mayor included the children and the citizens over there. I know that a few people wanted to call in today. And I know that Rodney Gaines is working the Hickory Hill Community Center and his mom wanted to call in, but she's had some death in a family. So I told them I would speak on their behalf to let  Let my colleagues know that, and the mayor know, and administration, that we're so grateful for what he is providing over there, not only in the Davie Gardens area, because like the mayor said, all these community centers are open to all the children. No matter where you live, no matter what your zip code is, these community centers are open for everyone to come there. And also the parks that we have, everyone can enjoy them. So I just wanted to bring that up. Also, I wanted to say that  I have been trying to reduce the real estate tax because assessments have been gone up so high. And since I've been over there at the Hickory Hill Community Center and other places, so many citizens have come up to me and said, what are we going to do? Why did our assessments go up so high? Even landlords have been calling me saying, what are we supposed to do? How are we supposed to provide affordable housing?  How are the people supposed to be able to stay in their homes when some people have been hit with over 50% in assessment? That's why I introduced a paper to reduce the real estate tax by six and a half cents. This would not have affected the budget. This would have helped every homeowner, every senior, because I know that a lot of the seniors lost their tax relief because they didn't get the papers  They didn't get the paperwork signed or sent it in time. So they have now been removed, which I think that is horrible. I think it's awful. And we've got to do better. We've got to do better with that. And I'm hoping that my colleagues will help me pass this, the six and a half cents, because to me, it's unbelievable. And especially when you're out there at the polls and you're listening to the people and you have them coming up to you  asking you how they're going to keep their homes. But anyway, again, I want to thank the mayor for helping us. And also the mayor gave us money for drainage too, for the, I believe it's the Chapel Drive on McGuire, the Chapel Drive. They have been waiting for years and years and years. They keep getting flooded out of their homes and streets and all of that. And the mayor went over there and he talked to them. And we also did a sidewalk over there and the citizens were coming up to him, asking him to please help with the drainage. And he  has kept his word and did that.

And I just feel like, even though this is a once in a lifetime, a once in a career opportunity that  we could have done some things differently. I think we have some good items in ARPA, and I think we missed out on a couple opportunities. I think we could have done more economic development.

I think we have before us a really important change in the trajectory of investments, especially in neighborhoods that have needed it for a long time. I do agree with some comments made by some of the speakers around  This is something that we should be doing every year, and it's unfortunate it took an opportunity such as this with this kind of funding to really get to work at finding the fundings for this, because I believe that it is a priority all across the city. And I know that there are needs we all have in our districts, some bigger than others, some that require $20 million, others that might require maybe just $1 million. But I do believe that going into our upcoming budget, I do want to make sure we carry those forward.  I do share in some concerns because I do believe that there are some ideas mentioned in the budget process last time that were not funded because of this funding that are still not funded. And so I do see that there are needs that we have to address, and I'm not sure exactly how we're going to encompass that in the upcoming budget process. But these are still needs that we've all brought up from our last budget process in FY 2022, which we are currently in that are going to  Remain unfunded until we get to a place of addressing those, and so I will. Be working with the rest of you, the eight of you to see how we can work together on finding a plan. It doesn't need to be done necessarily in next year's budget, but I do believe our residents need to see where this money does fit in the budget. If it's not next year, it's gotta be in 2024 and it's gotta be in 2025 and the things we have to start working on together because it's not just going to stop at this project. These are one time expenses.  We have works to do. I really think we need to focus on youth sports and activities. I want people active in these parks every day. I do not want these to be beautiful parks that sit there empty because there's no events or activities going on in there. So we have work to do to create this effort citywide. And I know that even in the first district, I had a resident's child mow the lawn, mow the grass of one of the fields because they wanted to play soccer on it.  And just knowing that these are some of the challenges we deal with today, and I want to make sure we don't have that after we have these beautiful parks and community centers invested in. And so we need to make sure we do our aspect preparing for what this looks like in the future. I'll say one last comment. This is great. I do want to make sure we keep a really good dialogue between the administration and council in regards to any changes in funding and changes in costs to make sure that we understand if something goes over or we're going to address it and if things are under.  what we're going to do next, because I think that there are opportunities where we can work together on that. So because this is the day, the vote, the last time I get to speak about it directly, I wanted to make those comments one last time. I feel like we all agree on those together and I look forward to working on that with you. I too will support this plan and look forward to seeing more children unfortunately left.

RCH_10_25_21,SPEAKER_04,"Thank you, Madam President. Again, echo the same sentiment, thanking everyone for  sharing their thoughts and their dreams for how these dollars should be spent. I'm excited about the investment in Southside. And, you know, as much as we're investing in Southside, it's still an investment in the city. We can't invest in any part of the city and not have it impact the overall city. And so I'm excited about what these centers will do.  I'm especially excited about the infusion of dollars in the Affordable Housing Trust Fund, that we're going to put money towards affordable housing right now and be able to step up and to assist our most vulnerable. Because we know those who have been impacted by COVID. We know that black and brown communities have been disproportionately impacted by COVID and that's what  Majority of these dollars should go to. That is the necessity of this hour. That lives have been dramatically changed and. As much as I want sidewalk sidewalks. Are not going to help people get through Kobe. That's just the reality of it, and so I'm excited to see.  processes we will put in place to ensure that our community centers are beacons of hope and light within our communities where you can have health centers, health clinics, where you can have job readiness programs and just all these creative ideas that our parks and rec folk have, but they just haven't had the facilities to exercise so much of the training and  expertise that they have. And so I'm excited about that. To my colleagues on council, we've said a lot about how we prepare and how we set priorities. And we have to find a way to continue to do it in real time. As we deal with the budget annually, we should know what our priorities are. There's no reason as much as we are here  the number of meetings that we have currently and the number of meetings that we could potentially have that as soon as we enter a process, we just have a list. The same way, Madam Chief of Staff, the same way we have our priorities for the legislative agenda. We already know what they are. We got them listed out and they're ready to be handed over at,  at a moment's notice. And I believe we need to do the same thing as it relates to our priorities as a city, to have a shared understanding, a commitment. So it's not a rehashing, but it's just something that we continue to work from. So we're not debating whether or not this is important or not. We've already said it's important,  So now when the funds are available, we just check it off the list and we just keep moving on. And it's a living document. And that's something I would like to see us get to where it's not in the ninth hour, because I agree with my colleague from the fourth. We spent a lot of time. And I'm not going to say there's no fruit to show, because again, the mayor put forth a piece that we're going to follow.  But as we as a council move at these things proactively and develop a process by which we communicate with the administration and communication works both ways that we listen and they listen and it's give and take and we move forward and we make things happen. But in the end, I'll remind us of this, like I always do during the budget season.  It goes through our five votes, our six votes. If we develop a plan that's thought out, that's vetted, where we have long conversations with the administration and vice versa, there's nothing we cannot do. And I just want to challenge us in doing that, to be proactive, to make decisions,  to support our decisions and move forward. Because again, we expended an inordinate amount of time over the summer. And what fruit did we get out of some of those processes? Because I will be very critical. Outside, I mean, the stuff that I spoke with the mayor on and things of that nature, did all of them get in this paper? No. And it wasn't possible because I had a lot of ask and just one ask took,  a decent portion of the first 77 million. But, you know, so I feel heard. I won't sit here and say that the administration, that the mayor didn't hear me. I feel heard because we're getting some things done. But I think the engagement from our side could have been different if we met, got through the process, had an understanding and then presented  These are the things that we want to see done and stuck to it. The mayor is still coming to us for six votes tonight. And I support y'all. I will stand with y'all. If we have a plan that's thought out that is gonna meet the need and not just something we want in the first or something that we want in the ninth, but what are we doing as a city?  I'm promising you all right now, I will stand with you. I will. As we work together and move together. And so I want to challenge us as we move forward in the budget, as we move forward throughout the rest of our term, Madam Chief of Staff, Madam President, let's make sure that we're having meetings proactively and engaging, and maybe we don't need to take August off.

I know I was out there all weekend and then out there last week talking to people, talking to the citizens.

I would have fought because so many people thought it was in my district. It's not in my district. It's in your district. And I would have fought tooth and nail for you to get the Southside Community Center because you had the parking.  And that's the first thing I brought up to Chris and to the mayor. Look at this. Look at Hickory Hill that I had a meeting and the people got turned away because there was no place for them to park. They were calling me after 10 o'clock, fussing at me because they couldn't get in there. Then once they got in there, I mean, it was not like when you had your meeting and I got some citizens to come to your meeting.

So I don't I don't know if I if it's because the mayor gave gave the people over there. He heard them when he was campaigning. They said, look at this. We have not a damn place to play for our children over here. And they didn't.  And it's right off a rough road. And he said, I hear you.

Didn't get the sidewalks. And you're right. I know, you know, there's a lot of areas in your place. You do not have sidewalks. I don't have it on Walmsley.

And clearly, probably none of us feel like we got, because we didn't have as much money, but we have opportunity  because one of the things that happened in this discussion was the overlay of the equity lens. And so we got some things included here that were really based upon us drilling down and looking at equity across the city, which I really appreciate. So the opportunity, again, these are, and many folks have stated, these are one-time dollars, but we also can be strategic in leveraging these dollars to,  get additional support philanthropically and otherwise, corporations, foundations, etc. And so look forward to that effort because many of the challenges that we are looking to address are generational. They're not going to be all addressed in two years. And so, and we know that. And so how we then work to get additional funds will be critical. So, and I was trying to  So I'll say ditto on many of the other items that were raised. We still have more work to do. Prioritization will be critical. Collaboration will be critical. The application of an equity lens will be critical.

RCH_10_25_21,SPEAKER_05,"OK. First of all, I want to thank Lincoln for having a conversation with me earlier. We finally were able to have our monthly meetings. We haven't been able to have it, so we did have one today and I appreciate all your comments.  What you said, and I'm not going to speak for you because I know that you want to have an opportunity to speak, but I want to say that. And it passed this past weekend and really the past week of being over there to Hickory Hill Community Center and also at other places I've heard so much about, you know, our police officers leaving and our police officers not. The morale is down in the Police Department and.  You know, the surrounding counties are taking the best of the best that we have. And it's not right. You know, we have back 20 years ago, might've been 198,000 people in the city. Now there's over 232,000. I don't believe that everybody got counted. I agree with the mayor. I do not think that everybody got counted. I think it's more than 232,000 people in the city. I think that we don't have enough police officers. And when I hear the people, not only in my district, but they,  This weekend and all last week at Hickory Hill Community Center, people were coming from everywhere to vote, and they were saying, where's our police? We don't see no police officers. You go to Chesterfield County down, and it's Jefferson Davis Highway still in Chesterfield. I was over there Friday, and I put on Facebook, be careful because the police are everywhere. This was like 5 o'clock in the afternoon, 6 o'clock in the afternoon. Every time I turned, I saw a police car. You go on the  Richmond Highway, there's not any. And it's not their fault. They are not here. We don't have community policing anymore. Community policing is gone. And I'm not just saying it. I'm saying it from the citizens. I'm hearing from them tell me, we don't see our officer that we used to have. What happened to her? What happened to him? Where are they? They don't come to our meetings anymore like they used to.  They don't check on us no more. They used to come and knock on the door if they didn't see us. There's not any. You can't. These police officers are running, and I know Stephen Willoughby's here. He can probably tell you. I'm quite sure there are more, more, more calls for 911 than ever before. These police officers are being run to death.  trying to answer these 911 calls. So how in the world are they going to have an opportunity to come back here and check on us, check on our seniors or whatever and say, are you okay? Do you need anything? They can't because they're just going call to call. It's not only about the pay. I feel it in my heart when I have a police officer's family member come up to me and say, where in the hell were you all at in 2020 when there was riots?  Where were you all at when my person that I loved with all my heart was having bags of urine thrown at him, poop thrown at him, battery acid thrown at him, screaming at him, spitting at him? Where were you all at? You all weren't there. You all weren't out there taking up for them. Where was the citizens that my husband reached in his pocket and took them shopping and bought stuff  And Ms. Trammell, you know what I'm talking about. Yes, I do. Where were they all at? And you want to know something? And the two new council members, whatever, three, I'm talking about us that was here in 2020. I'm talking about the mayor. But you all want to know something? Don't blame us council members and probably not so much as the mayor. Go after the person, that governor of Virginia.  Go after Mr. Ralph Northern, the governor, who could have called in the whatever, the state police, the National Guard, all of that to help our police officers. He was being protected 24-7. He didn't have to worry about his life. But I'm going to tell you right now, I know that us council members didn't know what to do. Did we have the authority? I don't think we did.  They were rioting in our city, something I have never, ever seen. And I will say this, I've never in my life seen the stuff that I saw on television. Can you imagine what those police officers, their family members, and those children had to see? They knew that that was their father or their mother up there. They knew that. They saw the mayor trying to, I guess, trying to keep peace in a way. They saw Chief Will Smith trying to keep peace.  They saw the officers where they had to restrain themselves. Can you imagine? Can you imagine one of us? We have went off on council. We've been sitting up here where people screamed and hollered at us and thank God for a president of council that has had to say, no, we do not do that. And I know not only myself, but other council members  have gotten frustrated when somebody comes in an audience and screams. They're not in our face. They're not spitting at us. They're not throwing bags of urine at us, bags of poop at us, battery acid on us, sitting our police cars on fire, sitting the public works vehicles on fire, a pulse bus.  Where were you at, Mr. Governor? You didn't do a damn thing to help us. Not a damn thing, but you sit back and let us catch the hell. Us council members, and I know other council members heard it too, and I know the mayor heard it. That was wrong. That was wrong what he did. He went in hiding. He let Richmond, Virginia down. He let us all down. Not only public safety, not only the police and the fire, he put their lives in jeopardy.  I want to say that I want to see, I want to hear from the chief about our staffing. I want to hear what are we going to do to keep our officers here with us and not for Chesterfield, for the police chief in Chesterfield, police chief in Henrico, Hanover, take our good officers. They get trained. And where do they get trained? They get trained right here in Richmond, Virginia. They probably go through more stuff where they have to think  Where they have to see from children being murdered, overdoses. Nobody's talking about the overdoses. I think there's more overdoses right now in our city than probably people being shot to death. Where's the outcry with that?  So I want to say our police officers are the first one. That's the first form of government. Our police officers, they go there when they get that 911 call. We don't. And we might hear it on the radio or our citizens call and say, hey, Reva, you know what? You got somebody just got shot and killed again. You know, somebody's laying in the street. And, you know, where's the police? So that's what I want to hear. And Lincoln, I want to just say to you, I appreciate you talking to me and I appreciate  You will get an opportunity to come up here. You can say what you and I talked about, but I want to see our police officers get that money. I want to see them get more money. And Councilman Michael Jones, you're right. I think that a lot of times they have been neglected. They've not probably with the budget and all that. Andreas, you have said it before, we need to do more to keep our officers here.

Our team Chief Carter and Chief Smith have been working on a memo for Council that will distribute in the morning about staffing levels and just to give you guys a high level, but also very detailed overview on the data of where things are, where they're going, and the recommendations we have for moving forward. In light of that, I would say that I do believe. It's important to know.  That this Friday will be the pay period of the paycheck where our police and firefighters will see the two steps that council approved, the mayor proposed and the council approved in this past budget. Tonight, you voted on a $3,000 bonus for every public safety official, including police, fire, 911 communications, justice services, as well as our partners at the Richmond Ambulance Authority.  Those bonuses are, I believe, important and significant, but to echo a conversation we had at the Finance Committee last week with Chairman Jones and Councilwoman Larson regarding the issue of the pay plan study and implementation, I will say for anyone who may have concern that those bonuses are meant to be a replacement for the compensation and the pay study adjustment, I would say wholeheartedly that is not the case. Bonuses are important. They're an important way to reflect the sacrifices and  service of our frontline responders during particularly the COVID pandemic, but it is not a replacement for a comprehensive and an effective pay plan and its implementation. So while we look forward tomorrow to having a more detailed conversation about staffing levels, et cetera, I would just remind council that some of the efforts that we have worked on collaboratively are coming home at the moment  steps being implemented for this pay period with the bonuses that were approved this evening.

RCH_10_25_21,SPEAKER_21,"Thank you everyone for the comments and for the support that you've shown RPD over the last few months and also the last two years. Currently, our vacancies are 102. All right, that is not unusual for across the nation. Right now, 86% of law enforcement agencies across the country are experiencing shortages. What we are experiencing here in Richmond is no different than anywhere else in the country.  We are just seeing young people and even some of the veterans just leaving the professions. Yes, we have had individuals to leave to go to surrounding counties, but we also have had a lot of individuals to do other things. One young lady left to just go drive with Amazon, truck driver. We also have several who have been pulled in by the federal government, the FBI. We have a very good training program here, as I've said before, and I think that is a badge of honor.  We have also had some pulled to the state attorney's office. We have very good people that we have hired over the years. And they are just leaving the profession for several reasons, several personal reasons. However, one of the stats that I think you'd find it most concerning to me is that our recruiting efforts or our number of applications coming in are down by 52%. That is also not unusual when you start to look at what's going on across the country.  We will not stop attrition. I think we can do things and put measures into place, but people will retire. People will leave. We need to have good people coming in and we need to convince people once again, that this is an honorable profession because it has been, and it always has been, and will continue to be. Looking at some of the numbers, we looked at numbers since 2017, we had 40 separations in 2017, in 2018, 56, 2019, 48,  In 2020, we had 72, and this year we've had 83 resignations moving forward. Our attrition rate is about 15%. We are looking at ways in order to change the perception of policing. I think that is very important, the rebranding of this profession, of our organization, to let people know that they can come here and thrive and be part of something and be part of change that is great.  We are looking at recruiting challenges as well too, different ways to recruit. I am now looking to bring in four additional background investigators, which will free up the recruiters to actually go out and do a very important job, and that is recruit. Go to college campuses, military bases to actually convince people that, hey, Richmond is as great as you think it is, and you should come here and work. We are looking at competitions once again from other agencies because we're all pulling from the same pool of people.  Everyone in this region, everyone around the country, we're hitting the same places, but we need to do that better. We're looking at retention challenges, and I thank the administration for actually restoring or giving back the two-step increases for our officers. That is a very good sign, as well as tonight, you, City Council, just approved a $3,000 bonus for our officers as well, too. You are showing your support for our officers as well. We are also looking to overcome some challenges  Challenges we have with hiring laterals. Laterals is a good way to bring in officers and increase your staffing pretty quickly. And we have a different retirement system. We just have to convince people that once they leave another organization, they can bring their certification here and continue to work and have another salary coming in on top of a retirement from where they came from. Also, as I spoke about before, the federal level has a very, very, the federal agencies has a very aggressive policy and recruiting right now. They are out looking for good people and they're getting them.  SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE CAN DO IS ACTUALLY THE REBRANDING. WE NEED TO CHANGE THE PERCEPTION OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THE STEREOTYPES. WE ALSO NEED TO LOOK AT FUNDING 100% OF THE DEPARTMENT'S AUTHORIZED STRENGTH, INCREASING PUBLIC SAFETY PERSONNEL AND OVERHIRE IF WE CAN. A LOT OF AGENCIES ARE DOING THAT FROM THE SMALLER AGENCIES TOO. AND WE ARE ALSO IN THE WORKS OF CREATING AUXILIARY POLICE FORCE THAT WILL ALLOW POLICE OFFICERS TO ALLOW RETIREES TO COME BACK AND WORK IN A PART-TIME STATUS, WHICH COULD HELP OUT IN NUMEROUS WAYS.  We are looking at this whole problem that we have right now holistically, but I think that we continue to need number one things that we need to just show our officers the love. They are not feeling the love right now and they need to feel it from everybody. I think that would be the number one thing that we can do to everyone who has shown the support and coming out to our  Congratulations. Thank you to our memorial service. Thank you all for showing your support there. They did not go unrecognized. They did see you there. Thank you for being there. But I think the one thing, the other thing that's been brought up here is about the raise and about the different pay scale. Yes, we need a pay scale. I believe the surrounding counties beat us to it. That's it. They just beat us to it. Not that we didn't care. Not that we're not going to get it corrected. They just beat us to it. That's it. And we can correct that and we will correct that.  And I believe that we went about it the right way of doing it in a professional and business manner of hiring someone to come in and make sure that we get it right, that we show that value correctly.

RCH_10_25_21,SPEAKER_03,"Good evening, council president and members of council.  I have a prepared statement, my memo. And following my memo will open or at least allow you to ask questions if you like. And I will also provide a summary from the memo. Richmond Fire Department is experiencing a high number of uniform vacancies. The combined effect of carrying vacancies, daily scheduled and unscheduled leave and the impact of COVID-19 pandemic  has had an escalating challenge to ensure minimum staffing requirements are met. As a result, in 2021, we implemented a mandatory overtime model to address the staffing shortages. Currently, we are averaging about 14.8 overtime shifts per day, equating to about 15% of the staff's employee count. Now, our mandatory overtime is not unique to Richmond. As a matter of fact, Richmond Fire Department is one of the last fire departments to institute  A mandatory overtime policy. Most metro park departments in the country and definitely here in the Commonwealth has predated us by years by having a mandatory overtime policy. Since 2017, Richmond Fire Department has been trying to recruit and hire annually. In October of 2017. The fire department had 35 vacancies. Today we have 41 sworn vacancies. On November 8th of this year,  FIREFIGHTER ONE RECRUIT CLASS OF 21 WILL START THEIR FIRE ACADEMY, GRADUATING THE FIRST WEEK OF DECEMBER. THE STAFFING CHALLENGES EXPERIENCED BY OUR RICHMOND FIRE DEPARTMENT IS NOT UNIQUE. A QUICK INTERNET SEARCH YIELDS A PLETHOR OF LOCAL, REGIONAL, STATE, AND NATIONAL FIRE DEPARTMENTS ARE EXPERIENCING A SIMILAR DILEMMA. LAST YEAR'S CIVIL UNREST AND THE 2019-2020 PANDEMIC, WHICH CONTINUES TODAY, HAS INVERSELY AFFECTED OUR ABILITY TO HIRE  During the 2020 calendar year. So exactly what I'm saying on specifically what I'm saying is as a fire department as an organization, we sought to hire or had planned to hire recruit class in 2020. But because we could not burst CDC recommendations, we could not see the class. We could not train the class because of the pandemic at that time, although we had planned to do so. The fire department attrition range is is from 3 to 5% annually. The most.  Significant impact affecting daily staffing, again, is the vacancies. This includes known retirements that we refer to as drop, unknown or early retirements, and unplanned separations. Again, my tenure began in 2017 with 35 vacancies. The data that I will share with you now is a snapshot of the attrition from 2017 through 2022 and the related cause for those separations. In 2017, we had three separations from Richmond Fire Department.  One included the drop, one person resigned, and one person was terminated. In 2018, we had 33 people separate from the fire department. 13 were in the drop program, three terminations, and 17 resignations. And those resignations weren't because people wanted to go and work for other fire departments. Their spouse got jobs in other communities. They chose other careers. And of that 17, three of those members sought to try to get their job back.  In 2019, we had 23 separations, including 13 drops, seven terminations, one disability retirement, and two deaths of employees. The seven terminations included four persons in our recruit academy who failed to meet the minimum requirements for our recruits to complete the academy. In 2020, we had 12 separations. Those 12 included three drops, two early retirements, and seven resignations.  So as it relates to people leaving the Richmond Fire Department and going to other organizations, in 2020, we had one member that leave that took a promotion in Henrico County. And in 2021, we had a member to leave to go to Loudoun County, who also took a promotion, not because they didn't like Arpen or what we were going through, but they received opportunities for promotion that they wouldn't have gotten in our department because we didn't have the vacancies to promote them into.  This year in 2021, we have 31 separations. Of those 31 separations, 23 are attributed to the drop program retirement, one termination, one disability retirement, one death, and five resignations, and also a delayed hiring process, which pushed our hiring back for 2021. And as it relates to 2022, the upcoming calendar year, we are anticipating 13 known other drop separations or retirements. As I mentioned before,  Since 2018, only four Richmond firefighters have resigned to gain employment without the fire departments. Just four. And one of those employees, former employees, went to Virginia Department of Fire Programs, which is not a fire department, but it's a fire agency that trains firefighters. That person went to a position that I created when I was the director of Virginia Department of Fire Programs.  OTHER DEPARTMENTS STRUGGLING WITH STAFFING ISSUES, FIRST WITH VIRGINIA DEPARTMENTS INCLUDE THE CITY OF ALEXANDRIA, VIRGINIA, THE CITY OF PETERSBURG, THE CITY OF PORTSMOUTH, OUTSIDE OF THE STATE OF VIRGINIA, THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO WHERE THEY ARE BRANDING OUT FIRE COMPANIES DAILY BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE STAFFING TO MEET DEMANDS, THE CITY OF SACRAMENTO, CALIFORNIA, HILLSBORO COUNTY, FLORIDA, THE CITY OF TAMPA, THE CITY OF ATLANTA, DOUGLAS COUNTY, GEORGIA, THE CITY OF CHICAGO, ILLINOIS, LEXICON, KENTUCKY,  the city of Baltimore, the city of Minneapolis, Minnesota, Columbus, Ohio, the city of Austin, Texas, the city of Fort Worth, Texas, the city of Houston, Texas, the city of Seattle, Washington, most Virginia and national volunteer firefighters, as well as the U.S. Forest Service federal firefighters. Some of the actions that we've taken thus far to address our vacancies is that we've revised our recruitment process, which has been very successful.  We've balanced our shifts to maintain an even shift across the board. We've onboarded part-time, recently part-time or retired firefighters. We reassigned some of our 40-hour personnel to temporarily back to our field. And again, speaking about our successful hiring process, we've hired from 2018 till today, a firefighter from Bristol, Virginia, nine Chesterfield County firefighters,  A firefighter from Fredericksburg City, five Hampton firefighters, five Hanover firefighters, up to, well, including the class that will start on the 8th, will be five Henrico firefighters, considering the tight labor market that we have. One Hopewell City firefighter, one Prince William County firefighter, one Spotsylvania firefighter, one Virginia Beach firefighter, two Newport News firefighters, and four City of Petersburg firefighters.  So like Chief Smith, I would say that this labor market is very tight. This is not a Richmond phenomenon, although that's not an excuse. It is a national phenomenon. I know that we are doing everything that we can do proactively, rationally, and creatively to address this staffing shortage. And I yield my time to.",5241,5696,"""""",Other,Other,0,0

And he said, yes, that a few years back,  maybe six or seven years, they were asking how did Richmond, Virginia do it? We did it with community policing. And we need to realize that Governor L. Douglas Wilder, when he was the first African-American governor of Virginia, also the first African-American mayor, that's what he brought to us. He formed that community policing. He brought the citizens out to be with the police. Even Albertina Carter back in the day, she would take  the officers to the churches, to the community, and let them meet their officers. That's how we got, and that was under the Chief Jerry Oliver back then, and the city manager style of government.

That's the perfect lead in for a paper that went before finance last week that, um,  is asking the mayor to fund whatever the recommendations come from that study in the upcoming budget. And after meeting with our first responders, fire and police, and as well as talking to a lot of the officers I've known for years, I mean, everything,  You all are sharing. I don't think it is a secret chief. I'm happy to hear that you're looking at this from a holistic point of view because I do think pay is one piece of it.

So I would love the support of my Council members on that paper as it comes forward at our next meeting. But it is.  I mean, what I'm hearing from officers is really, it's really sad. I mean, morale is so low. And, you know, I'm trying to reach out as I can and talk to folks and talk to our officers and express my support. But I'm really scared for our city. You know, we live in a lawful  Society and we need folks to enforce the law and we've always had a really boots on the ground police force like Councilwoman Trammell said community policing and right now we just barely have enough folks to answer the calls. So. Whatever I can do to be supportive, I want to thank Councilwoman Trammell for putting this on the agenda.  and for bringing up this topic in a public setting because we've all been talking about it with each other, but we do need to put some sunlight on it and make sure that our first responders know we're here to support them and we need them here in the City of Richmond.

RCH_10_25_21,SPEAKER_04,"Yes, ma'am, Madam President.  After the summer that really the entire country went through, I'm glad that the chief brought up kind of national trends so we don't feel as if we are an anomaly. People that serve, whether it's police, whether it's military, ebbs and flows in community support. Again, my father was a Navy SEAL.  did two tours in Vietnam, and he wasn't accepted that well. One, because of the color of his skin and the time in which he served. And then two, just the public sentiment on the Vietnam War. And he still showed up to work every day because he had to. That's what he was called to do. And the men and women that serve, I challenge them to have the same  type of resolve because it will not always be a good day. Everyone will not always support what you do. And let me say this, I support the men and women in blue. I support the men and women that serve in police department. I do. If you want to know, come on the community walk. Any officer that's having questions about whether or not they're supported, come on the community walk in the 9th district. Come to a district meeting. We just had  Officer Chavis and Davis come out. I think Davis was a newbie and they let him know that. And there was a great level of acceptance. Are there things we want from police? Yes, there is. Are there things we want to see done? Yeah, there are. I mean, we want to see speeding stopped. We want to see that enforced. We want to see the drunk drivers that are leaving  Bars and restaurants at 12 and one o'clock. We want to see that stop because they're running into houses, they're running into cars, they're doing all these things to ravage neighborhoods. And we want to see that. My feel on pay scale, I believe the administration has got to step up. We've said this in years past, what Ms. Jordan said. They've got to step up.  And I appreciate everyone that comes before council and lobbies us, but the buck stops and begins with the mayor's administration. And we want to see that priority there as it comes forward and not just put it on us as a group of nine to take the heat in that. Public safety is important. Clean and safe neighborhoods, number one indicator for schools.  For success in schools. That's it. Bar none. Clean and safe neighborhoods. And my neighborhood's not that clean and it's not that safe. Now, am I afraid? No. I'm not afraid. Because when you look at the numbers, at least in the 9th District, because I have looked at the numbers, it's not up. Relatively flat. So our city isn't necessarily in some crisis where we're walking around afraid and in terror.  My colleague in the eighth is kind of on point when we talk about the impact of opioids, overdoses, things of that nature. That's our take. One in five, if we want to talk what I'm afraid of, one in five in the month of August, one in five overdoses in the city of Richmond happened in one block of the ninth district. One block, not the entire ninth district,  Madam President, we're talking between Chippenham and Midlothian and Carnation and Midlothian. That one stretch, one in five, let that sink in. That's my issue right now. We have some men and women that are ODing and what are we doing to assist that? Because basically what the numbers show is that the ninth isn't any more or less than what it's been, right? Outside of random gunfire,  Things of that nature. So I'll still say this. They're still doing their job. And guess what? People will always critique the job you do. Right? You do it right, they're going to talk. You do it wrong, they're going to talk. So do your job. Put your head down. Keep, you know, like my granddad would say, keep your hand to that plow. And just keep working. Because in the end, if you do it for public sentiment, good luck.  Because we're in that same position. If you try to please the Paulists, good luck with that. They'll be with you one day and they'll be against you the next. I think that's in the Bible somewhere. Hosanna, Hosanna. By Friday, they said, give us Barabbas. Crucify the other guy. And so I support the police. I support what they do. I believe this. Anyone that runs into stuff that normal people run away from, they ought to be compensated for. Period.  That's where I am on the record. Anyone that runs two. And we did, we had a 9-11 commemoration last week. And it breaks my heart to see men and women that gave their lives in 9-11. Breaks my heart. And so anyone that runs two while we have the luxury of running away, I think they should be compensated for.  And so I support individuals going on and Madam President going to the FBI, going to the Secret Service, going to these other places as a way of career mobility because they should have the opportunity to do that. And I'm glad and I hope that we continue to share those numbers because I don't think that's being shared as well. There will be attrition. There will be individuals that wish to move. There will be individuals that choose to leave for a myriad of reasons. And right now it's all being dumped on the protests.  And I don't think that's a fair picture of everything. So with that, Mr. CAO, I really want to challenge, and we do have a paper coming out. I want to challenge you that Mr. Pannelly does not have to come before us and say, what are we going to do to compensate the men and women? That is the day I'm looking forward to when Mr. Pannelly just sits in the back and says, hey, you guys are doing the right thing. I love you, sir.",6122,6538,"""""",Other,Other,0,0

And I want to be clear that this body and to our public safety professionals support you. It's along with the administration as evidenced this evening by proving the premium pay for $3,000 for the bonus  as evidenced by the presentation of the administration and approval by council to begin to provide the two-step salary, which will hit paychecks next pay period. And hopefully folks here and from the comments thus far that we are committed to ensuring that the compensation is appropriate, both salary and benefits. And we're looking at that relative to  implementation with the 21-22 budget, if not sooner, but certainly the upcoming budget, I think is what we're talking about.

It is a good plan for a locality that has a large police department that is totally out of control and an outside entity is needed to take over and establish order. That locality is certainly not Richmond, Virginia.  The police did not do everything right during the unrest, but definitely should not be completely taken over by an outside dictatorship. And that is exactly what the task force is recommending. With the destruction of our city, the thefts and harassment of officials at their homes, there should have been many more arrests and convictions.  The type of model presented to us is not being used because it is a power grab on steroids and will cause more problems than it could ever solve. I suggest that two compliance officers, not members of the police department, be hired to investigate all complaints and be given any authority needed to do so.  They would also make sure that the police department follows all through on all of the rules and regulations and dispense all discipline in a timely manner. A secretary would also need to be hired to maintain the official paperwork and answer the telephone for the compliance officers. It is not necessary to spend $1.2 million to get the job done.  We need the police, but they can find a job somewhere else. Let us not put up roadblocks that become a detriment to our city.

I'm a resident of the First District, president of the Richmond Building and Construction Trades Council, and the business manager for the Electrician's Union, IBEW 666. Here today to discuss opportunities for city residents that are presented in upcoming projects and the planning process that will utilize property currently owned by the city. Misclassification and wage theft is rampant in the construction industry, disproportionately affecting women and people of color.  Imagine you have all seen the high-profile projects in the news recently with allegations of misclassified workers and wage theft. Misclassification of workers takes tax dollars out of city and state coffers, cheats workers of protections like workers' compensation and unemployment insurance, and leads to reduced opportunity for city residents to participate in apprenticeship training.  Development by the city or on land the city sells to a developer should create jobs that pay a family-sustaining wage with benefits. Instead of a race to the bottom encouraging unscrupulous and illegal business practices, Richmond development should be providing training and apprenticeship opportunities to residents. As many of you know, there are tools available to Council passed in the 2019 General Assembly session.  I urge the council to consider the use of project labor agreements or community benefits agreements and prevailing wage requirements on upcoming development projects the city has a part in. Additionally, there are AFL-CIO funds that invest union capital in the development of affordable housing. There may be opportunities for those funds to partner with the city and or developers as the Coliseum Area Framework Plan is rolled out, as well as a redevelopment associated with the Diamond.

RCH_11_08_21,SPEAKER_02,"This is about ordinance 2021-278. This is the right time, right?  Thank you. My name is Anna Lee Bergstrom. I wanted to thank you first for giving me the opportunity to speak here this evening. I'm actually a resident of Henrico County, and I'm representing 54 of my neighbors speaking in opposition to the Ordinance 2021-278. We've submitted a letter of opposition outlining several reasons, one of which being traffic and safety that I'd love to highlight here this evening.  This went before the Planning Commission last week. We highlighted several of these traffic and safety concerns, and while it ultimately passed planning to be before you here tonight, Commissioner Poole spoke, and we agree that this is an intersection at Charles and Patterson Avenue, which is fully in the city of Richmond, but which is immediately bordering Henrico County, the neighborhood behind it.  And it is getting ready to have a traffic accident. And we think that approving this as currently proposed will exacerbate that. Specifically, this is a permit that is being sought to build seven units up to three bedrooms each. There is not sufficient parking. This will cause parking in the neighborhood and on Patterson Avenue where sight lines are already terrible, where there are frequent accidents, and where there are children crossing without any...  Crosswalks across Patterson, which is a very busy street, specifically between Three Chop Road and Maple Avenue.  On Patterson Avenue, an area spanning 1.4 miles, there is not a single crosswalk to help the residents, children, anyone to cross the streets there. We are not resistant to change. We are not resistant to development. We simply ask for the city's help in partnering with the county to look at some of the traffic issues that this will cause in our area. The street this is being planned on is mostly in the county, but the parcel is obviously fully in the city, which is why we're here before you tonight.  We only ask for your guidance and help in establishing things like crosswalks, potentially a light, speed bumps on the street, anything to make it a safer area. The Planning Commission felt it was sufficient to put five parking spots on the side of the street to help. We feel that is insufficient and will make it worse.  Additionally, the Planning Commission seemed unable to answer their own questions about whether the master plan had fully accounted for what would happen if a property seeking a soup or an ordinance was located immediately next to the county with residential single-family zoning in opposition to what was being approved. No one in the meeting was able to answer the question of whether that was okay or not, yet it was approved. We ask for your help, please, in addressing the traffic issue in our neighborhood.",1197,1362,"""""",Public Hearing,Commenter,0,1

RCH_11_08_21,SPEAKER_10,"GOOD EVENING, COUNCIL. I'M SPEAKING IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE PREVIOUS INDIVIDUAL ON THE ISSUE ORDINANCE OF 2021-278.  My name is Kathleen Thompson. My husband Tom and I are the owners of 6903 Edmonstone Avenue in Henrico County. Our home was built in 1902 and is situated to the north of the proposed development named Patterson Row Houses. We have resided in this home for almost 18 years. To state my opposition to this proposed development is an understatement.  Let me be clear. My property is the only property fully impacted if this development is approved.  First, my husband and I wish to thank Commissioner Poole for acknowledging our opposition to this development. He acknowledged our concerns for the existing traffic flow issues along Charles Street and Patterson Avenue, the proposed scale and density of the planned dwellings, and the lack of architectural congruence with the surrounding neighborhood known as Duntreeth. And I will pick up on that shortly.  To the points of height, density, and architectural congruence. Although the staff found the proposed height of the planned high-density dwellings to be consistent with the height permitted, underlying R4 district and the architectural and building materials to be consistent with the surrounding neighborhood. This, in fact, is not true. Number one.  A person need only stand on the corner of Charles Street and Patterson Avenue, looking in all directions, north, south, east, and west. There is not a single family dwelling with three stories of living space in that corridor. You have to go at least a mile and a half till you get to the corner of Maple Avenue and Patterson Avenue to find a small three-story apartment community called The Chalet.  Secondly, if the Master Plan 300 is based for approving the Patterson Road development, the approval of such would be in clear conflict. Master Plan 300's height of buildings is related to business-type structures only, not dwellings.",1374,1524,"""""",Public Hearing,Commenter,0,1

I think I understand as having lived in the two blocks away from that area myself, I understand that this is a T intersection and that Charles Street is used by a lot of people trying to get around the traffic on Three Chopped. And it is highly trafficked. I do think there are impacts in what they're referring to.  I would like to recommend that you pursue requesting a speed table in Henrico County between Monument and Patterson. I think that is not on the city's purview. I cannot request that on their behalf. But I think your concerns are because the flow of traffic is unimpeded, literally from Horsepen all the way through to Monument. There are people going down that road. I've seen it. I've also probably done it myself. And so with that, one of the things, if you're trying to address safety, that is one key aspect or move.  people trying to navigate around traffic lights and speed calming efforts. And I always wanna make sure that you understand that your safety and concern was not ignored. But in regards to that intersection being the only place that matters, I feel like there needs to be a look at the entire stretch of that street  to support both aspects of what you're referring to, as well as the project at hand.

And there were a couple of residents that were strongly opposed to a restaurant.  But overwhelmingly, the community supported this SUP. The Fan District Association submitted a letter of non-opposition. And the Fan Business Area Association, I believe, supported the measure along with a petition that had, I think, 100 signatures.  So the reason that I do not accept the amendments is that it actually makes it harder to address the concerns that the neighbors who did have concerns had because you're baking and that this would then have to be a restaurant in subsequent uses.

There's a variety of small retail service office uses within B1. Part of the recommendation was made given the fact that this particular property  The use on the first floor is only 700 square feet in size. And so the restaurant use as being proposed currently would probably be the most intensive use of that. Given that, it's only 700 square feet in size. So there's only going to be a handful of tables and a handful of patrons at once. And so we felt in terms of providing the property owner with the most flexibility, as we know, business changes quite frequently.  and wanted to be able to provide that business owner the opportunity to perhaps shift as business needs changed without having to go through a legislative process to amend the special use permit, and therefore recommended that all uses within the B1 be proposed.",2171,2240,"""""",Other,Other,0,0

RCH_11_08_21,SPEAKER_07,"Perfect. Thank you.  Clearly, this paper is essentially reaffirming the tax rate that was approved and included in the council's adopted budget this past May and would support the ongoing operations of the city. I understand the intent and the goals of the councilwoman with the second paper regarding the rollback of the rate in order to  to essentially keep actual revenues level. I would just caution that with inflation at 5% costs, health care costs going up at 9% and the desire to continue to enhance services for the citizens, it's not something that I believe the administration can recommend or support that we would pull the rug out from under ourselves, so to speak, in regards to  Our property tax rate, which, as you know, funds the lion's share of our budget. I do understand the intent, I believe, behind the councilman's push for relief and understanding of our residents. It's something that I've had many conversations with councilmembers, Vice President Robertson, Councilmember Jones,  I could go down the line. I think I've spoken with many of you about pursuing any and all opportunities available to us under state law to provide relief for citizens, particularly those who are income limited or restricted and looking for ways to bring those opportunities forward. I also know that there are priorities in front of us that we are not funding today. We have a significant unfunded liability in our OPEB benefits, in our  capital maintenance and facilities, as well as our city fleet. So there are continued investments we need to make and would respectfully ask that council support maintaining the real estate rate at the $1.20 and not pulling it back. As I've said in several forums,  The budget department under Director Jason May has been working with our financial advisors at Davenport to develop a budget modeling system where we can look at how changes to either tax rates, growth, and revenues can show us our ability to meet not just our revenue goals, but our service and service enhancement goals. And so look forward to that being a large conversation that we have going forward, but would recommend given...  Everything, including the unfortunate loss of an opportunity last week in the 8th district, that we continue to look for how we prioritize and invest in the city and in city services. So with that, Madam President, I know the administration would be glad to answer any questions, but we do respectfully request that council affirm the paper maintaining the rate at $1.20 in 2020.  as opposed to moving forward with the paper to pull it back.

I just knew that there were discussions at the committee level and wanted to offer that opportunity because I understood the administration made some presentations there. For me, the paper and bringing it forth at the current rate was in follow up to discussions with the administration with the  the need for funding, the looking at prospectively the opportunity to address compensation,  for our public safety professionals, as well as ongoing infrastructure needs and upgrades and other salary adjustments, et cetera, for the organization. And so for me, not really having absolute clarity that this uptick that we saw would still be the case in terms of assessments,  In addition to the ongoing and escalating expenses for the city as a whole, I agree and support bringing forth the real estate rate at the 120. Ideally, I would love to be able to look at rolling back. I think we all would, without a doubt.  At this moment, given all that we're looking at in terms of organizational needs and what we're anticipating as additional funding needs, the 120 is what I brought forth. So with that, I would ask.

And so, I mean, and I know we talked about informal, about trying to look at how we move forward and  what we look at and things of that nature as it relates to the rising assessments in the South Side and how it impacts our vulnerable communities, because it's a real issue. I understand the need for revenue, but my question is, do we understand the basic budget assumption? What percent of growth in assessments  brought on a particular rate or a particular number in which we should tax the citizens. Secondly, what is that overage? What is that amount? Because, again, I just reached out to staff and they said basically that with the rollback, it leaves it pretty much net neutral, that it would still meet  the needs of the budget, whereas the 120, you would have a $20 to $25 million overage.

RCH_11_08_21,SPEAKER_28,"Basically, all I'm saying is, is that hopefully we would understand some of the numbers behind our decision, rather than simply saying we want to provide more services. That is the goal, right? We all want to provide more services and do other things. But my concern is, and the  the south side, we saw a 23% increase in assessments. And there's no way I can safeguard those residents individually without looking at the tax rate citywide. And so the only thing I'm trying to have now is the beginning of a conversation of what do we do, right? Outside of a study, and I know part of the studies may not allow us to section off the way we do  the tax abatement program or tax relief program for seniors. We may not be able to do that for vulnerable communities without just having it be a citywide effort. And so all I'm saying is I'm just laying out all the information that staff was very diligent in gaining. What was the impact? Why $1.13 versus $1.20? Why $1.20 versus $1.13? And again, the basic piece is this.  $1.13, and this is just from staff. This is just from our staff. $1.13 meets the budget need. $1.20 will generate $20 to $25 million above that. And so I'm just putting that into the public record, letting my colleagues on council know that this is what our staff brought back. And I'm just putting it out there so we can have a conversation now and ongoing  about which way to go. And let me say this. Let me say this. I don't want to hear from staff that we need more money to provide services to Southside. That's intent. It's intent. Because after last week's vote, we see that we're not getting more money. And so we still have other infrastructure issues in our vulnerable communities. And what are we going to do? And again, I don't want to hear, well, as soon as we get more money, we can do more. No.  I want to see a serious reallocation and reimagination of how we fund services in areas that we do not have. I have kids that are waiting an hour to get to school. They can't walk a quarter of a mile because it is unsafe. And if we would just put sidewalks in, but we don't have money for sidewalks because those dollars are going elsewhere in the city.  And so I know when I sit down and meet with our new CAO, it's gonna be, well, hey, if we could have got more money, we're not getting any more money. And so to my colleagues and everyone else, whether we go at 113, 115, 120, 125, how do we put emphasis in our black and brown communities that have been divested from? Because that's real. So we may not have another economic opportunity, another economic development deal that's gonna bring a windfall of cash, and that's fine. But what I don't wanna hear  from budget, administration, anyone else, and the mayor. Well, if we got more money, we could do more in your district. No. Start reallocating funds. We want to talk about defunding. Let's start defunding some other areas in this city, right, where there is a robust investment, where streets are fine, right, where grass is cut, and come back to Southside where we don't see those things.  And that's my challenge. I have kids that can't walk a half a mile because it's not safe. Major corridor, Hall Street, that we cannot walk simply because we don't have the funds, and the funds have been put somewhere else. And so to the budget, and we're going to have a very fun budget season, man, because I'm going to ask that staff would cut this thing up, slice and dice it, and things need to look different. Because, again, I can't wait on Navy Hill.  I can't wait on a casino, and we already have a casino in this city. It's less than a mile from my house. While everyone up in this place is discussing whether or not we want a casino in the city, hell, we already got one. And it backs up to my neighborhood. And we didn't have a say in it. We didn't have a say. It was by right.  And so all I'm saying is this. That's not true. No, I ain't done now. I'm not done.",2765,3038,"""""",Other,Other,0,0

We have gentrified and funded the gentrification of this city. And the unintended consequence is black and brown seniors cannot afford to live in this city. That is the unintended consequence that I am facing right now.  And so we're going to get very serious, Madam President, about investing in these communities that we have divested from. And I'm not saying anyone has a certain level of culpability. It's the system. Well, hell, I've been elected to help change the system. And we're going to do that. And how are we going to do that? That's the question. But it cannot be we need more money. We need to reallocate funds from going to certain well-to-do neighborhoods and  affluent neighborhoods that are riddled with tax-abated houses, $19.3 million a year is being abated in affluent communities that they can afford to pay their taxes, but they don't have to until it sunsets. And so until that happens...  Until that happens, we have to get serious about, because I'm tired of all these folk that have Black Lives Matter signs outside their homes, and they have something to say about how black folk live. But yet and still, when it comes time to putting the rubber to the road, BLM is set aside.

RCH_11_08_21,SPEAKER_27,"Good afternoon. Good evening, I guess. My name is Mike Kometic. I've spoken here before. I'm from New Era, Richmond. I just wanted to kind of reiterate  what Councilman Jones said, and that there's this constant need for money in these areas. So my son, we live on the South side. I used to live in Jackson Ward, but basically I priced out of the neighborhood a few years ago, which, you know, that's my situation to deal with. But I constantly see bike lanes, all these things being put into these neighborhoods to attract a certain group of people to it. But as Mr. Jones said,  There are no sidewalks for kids to walk down to be able to go to school in Southside on Hall Street. You know, and my son went there for the summer and it's crazy around there, you know, at  I can't think of which school he went to right off the top of my head, but the one on Hall Street, the newest school, he was there for summer school. And it's just crazy that I see kids walking down the street and some of them do end up walking, but it's very dangerous because there are no sidewalks. So to constantly be raising the taxes that affects the people that are most vulnerable in this community and they're constantly being put pressure onto them.  to be able to keep up with standards that are not being controlled by the city in the way that they need to be done. So then we need some other kind of situation to come in and give us more money in some kind of way, regardless of how it affects our citizens. And I think people voted that down last week and that's kind of what that vote was about, but the funds are there. They just need to be redirected into the proper places. And I would like to be able to see that done instead of raising the tax rate and having people have more of a burden on them. So.  That's it.

RCH_11_08_21,SPEAKER_06,"So, I feel like, thank you, Madam President, before I say anything further. Thank you for the chance to speak to this.  It's such a very complicated matter because the burden of this is on all residents. Whether fairly or unfairly, all residents are paying the burden of our increased assessments, which is an unfair burden because it's because people are investing and buying in our city. The market's creating changes in our home values, which is burdening people adjacent to have to deal with paying for that increase.  So we have complaints all across the city. All nine of us have complaints and issues around the same issue. It affects people differently, but in the same way. Their home, where they live, where they've created a place for their family to live. The issue we have is much more complicated than is the tax rate. We need to look at the actual, I think, the mix of how we have our revenues for real estate coming into the city.  An undue and unfair balance of residential payments for real estate taxes is way higher than our commercial burden. We need to focus on not just understanding the burden we see on investment on the residents, but we have in our control assets, land we own to move on,  to attract investment on a commercial area, to attract investment on a private side, to create land that's generating zero or next to zero tax revenue, to create jobs and housing and new commercial real estate spaces for offices and businesses in neighborhoods that need it. All over the city, we have assets like that sitting there doing nothing for us. Economic development is how we're going to have to change our viewpoint of what we do.  We need to start looking at our master plan, working on the aspects of the rezoning of our city, meeting the goals that we want to see forward in terms of equity, inclusivity, diversity.  We need to focus on transit-oriented development. Every city I go to that focuses on transit as their key focus of development sees incredible benefits to those communities. And more importantly, it takes away the need and necessity of needing a car, insurance, maintenance, gasoline on families that don't need to have to pay for that. I'm concerned that we're looking at this problem as one aspect of this entire pie of what our revenue and opportunity withholds for us.  We have at our opportunity, we talked about it earlier, we've moved it to the consent agenda. If we get a north-south pulse corridor bus route planned and we get maybe multiple routes looking to south side, we can start really looking at trying to find ways to really drive an investment in areas that needs it. I'm doing no car November right now. Even in my district, the bus comes every 40 minutes. I missed it coming back from school today because it worked at my teaching at U of R. I had to wait for 35 minutes for the next bus to come.  We have to do better than that for all of our residents because at the whims of what we're talking about with real estate taxes is not but a tip of the iceberg. We're talking about investment in our city. Where does that come from? We've said no to almost $2 billion of private investment in our city in the past couple years. That's not going to help us generate the money we need to sustainably fund schools, infrastructure, sidewalks, roads, etc.,  For me, the problem has to be looking at the bigger picture of where do we make a dollar? Because right now we're fighting about making sure those who are already paying our dollars keep paying more. And that's right now our residents. And for me, I'm torn because I understand the impact. I see it myself. I understand the struggles. I hear about it in emails we get from residents all over our city. But we need to take a step forward and look at how we generate revenues  And to Dr. Jones's point, more importantly, where are we putting them? The transfer center for GRTC needs to know where we're putting the BRT north-south. It's going to need to know where they intersect because then we can start planning in and around what's next. In those areas where you put that investment is where you're going to see new neighborhoods in Southside grow up or be revitalized again on Midlothian, Hull Street, Richmond Highway. That's the whole focus of us right now is we need to not look at just where we are today  But where do we go tomorrow? Because right now we are sitting looking at opportunities across our city on assets that we own, control, and if we move on tomorrow, can generate all the things we're talking about, complaining about not having today. And until we start putting together that plan, looking forward, and not putting the burden on our budget, putting the burden and the goals and expectations on the private sector to meet us where we're trying to go,  working collectively and collaboratively. That's the goal for the future of us. I've seen cities like in D.C., for example, the mix between residential housing burden and commercial. It's 30% residential, 70% commercial. The whole burden is on the burgeoning growth of commercial mixed-use developments. It's not on the residents. So you start realizing we need to look at those types of conversations. Where are we as a city? Whose burden are we putting this plate on right now?  And furthermore, as I lobbied for with council support a couple of years ago, Richmond's one of the few cities allowed by state ordinance or law to explore land value tax. Land value tax explores changing this tax burden based upon how land is zoned. The more dense the land is zoned, the more valuable it is, the more it's taxed. Guess what's not a high value asset of land? Single family homes.  It can only have one house on it. That same plot of land, if zoned for TOD or another mixed use development site, is worth 12 stories of multiple houses. If done correctly, worth way more. These are the types of things this council needs to explore because the tax rate isn't the problem. It's what we look to as all the complaints we have. I hear it. I get it. I see the problem. I see two options before me right now.  You know what, honestly, I don't like either one because I know on the other side of this conversation are residents that are struggling right now as we go into the holidays of knowing that in January, there's a tax bill due based upon what we're agreeing upon right now. So I just wanted to make these comments clear because to me before us, while we were talking about our real estate tax rate, we have to understand how we got here for sure. I agree, Southside needs investment.  It needs more than just what we had voted on last Tuesday. But to me, to get to that place, we need to put forward and before us as a council decisions that get us moving to attract investment, to create jobs, to build affordable housing all over the city. And that's what I'm committed to doing. And I will continue to with all of your help to get that done.",3492,3923,"""""",Other,Other,0,0

I also think the big takeaway for me, just hearing the comments of some of my colleagues, is we really need to have...

Well, they can cut them off now, but still they will try to work with you. I have somebody, my neighbor, he has not gotten a phone call back yet. He needs food. He needs help. My neighbor that I feed.  And Lincoln, you are so right. You and your administration and mayor worked hard for the one casino. And they worked hard. My colleagues, seven of us, we worked hard. To listen to...  to listen to the mayor and listen to Lincoln and his administration and to Alfred. Back and forth, we brought him here. Navy Hill was no comparison. Stop bringing up Navy Hill. I'm sick of it. Navy Hill has nothing to do with what this was going to be. This was not going to cost us one penny. Not one penny for the one casino. Nothing. No tax dollars. No incentive.  But that Navy Hill, every time you turn around, there was change, change, change. Something was changing in it, and it wasn't a good deal. And I took it to my people, and they said, no, don't vote for it. When they came to the meeting, my people said, no, don't vote for that. But the one casino, I took it to the people after I talked to the mayor, and the mayor told me not to say nothing. He would give me the opportunity to speak, and when he did, that's when I took it to the people, and they said, yes, they wanted it. They wanted it.  Y'all have let us down. You have let the black and the brown down. You hear me? And, Madam President, you said I'm going to listen. No, I just wanted you to bring it back to the papers that are on the table.

RCH_11_08_21,SPEAKER_21,"Thank you, Madam President. It's a hard conversation to follow. Reva, thank you so much. Thank you so much for your love and your compassion for the citizens in the city and for those that need us more, that need us to be the voice for them more.  And Councilman Jones, you're absolutely right. We can go back and look at it. It strikes me extremely strange that when we try to do something to help people that are at a lower income level in the city, we can't do one darn thing unless we get permission from the General Assembly to do so. Not one thing can we do.  The things that we talk about every day and have been talking about for years to help people that need us. They don't have the financial means to be able to do the things, to live a comfortable, reasonable life. But if we want to give a tax break for investors to build private sector housing with no affordable housing required,  No problem. Just do it. So I think that this whole system of equity, which really bothers me almost every time someone else come forward with a paper that has equity written in it, with a title that has equity written in it,  Because I'm not comfortable that we have defined what equity and equality mean in the city of Richmond and what has been done or is being done decisively to give us the privilege to talk about equity and inclusion in the city of Richmond. Our policies...  that we are governed by has provided tax dollars, tax incentive to grow the city of Richmond, and it does not, and it has not, and it still does not address opportunities for all people fairly. Not at all. Not at all. And  We struggle as a legislative body when we have to go to the General Assembly to ask for opportunities to just treat all our citizens fair. And we've been asking. It's not because we haven't been asking. We've not gotten any results.  You know, we can tell you, and I want you to know, because, you know, ever since I have been on this council and before I came on this council, I fought for affordable housing, and I still fight for affordable housing. It's only been within the last, I'm going to say, two years, just out of grace, that it appears to me that more folk are all of a sudden very interested in affordable housing.  But for the years that I have fought for affordable housing on this council, established affordable housing trust funds, spent two years going through all of the studies, all of the documentations, everything that was needed. At best, we could only find $700,000, maybe $1 million for affordable housing.  57% of our population was in poverty. We're not much better off than that today. People that live in public housing in the city of Richmond, just this weekend, my liaison was on the phone Friday, Saturday, Sunday. He said, I didn't have any heat. You know how cold it was this weekend? You know. You know what your heat was set on.  Now, is that everybody in the public housing community? No, I'm sure not everyone, but I can tell you for the public housing communities in the 6th District, they were on the phone all weekend trying to make sure that people had heat. Go visit the public housing communities. They don't have any grass in their front yards.  They don't have hookups in their housing units that they can put in washers and dryers. They don't have, you know, they're expected to wash their clothes and hang them out on a line, and they get about this much space for a line. We don't treat people as if they are human beings of equal worth and equal value  as our creator created all of us to be. So yes, it's not just Southside. It's not just Southside. It's a lot of areas in the city of Richmond, but you can look at map after map after map. When we look at where housing foreclosures have taken place, they are always in the same low-income or communities that are black and brown.  Always. When you look at which houses we've taken through tax sales because people weren't able to pay their real estate tax, same communities, black and brown. When you look at gentrification in the city of Richmond, okay, the pattern is the same. You know, Mr. Jones, you may be, we may be talking about, you know, and Reva, we may be talking about the increase in assessment values in the eighth and ninth this year.  But trust me, two years ago, it was Highland Park, okay? Highland Park is gentrified today. It's a systematic process of how you go through deflating  value of homes in African-American communities so that people can buy them cheap, and then how we go through a process of tax sales, code enforcement, and all the other industries working against you for the purpose of creating value for who's going to move in next.  And, you know, I know, Madam Chair, I know you want to move on, but this, you know, I will tell you, I have been where Ms. Trammell is tonight because the first year or two years that I was on city council, Mr. Pantley, he knows of that too, I voted and we successfully on council made a decision to decrease the real estate rate. And  Governor Wilder, Mayor Wilder was the mayor at the time, and he said, Ellen, I know what you're doing, but what's going to happen as a result of it is going to take us 10 years to get back to the revenue level that we are currently at when you reduce that real estate rate. So you all all got a report.  Just the other day, some legislation that I'm proposing, and as a part of that legislation, our staff included the last audit that was done on tax sales. Go back and look at it. You'll see where that tax rate was dropped. You will see how long it has taken us to get back to the same revenue level as it relates to dropping that real estate rate.  So there are long-term consequences that most of us, you know, I have difficult, I'll speak for myself, I have difficult to be able to look into that future window and honestly respect. I'm speaking to the paper, Madam Chair. Thank you. And I would love to do $1.13, but I would want to do it  For the majority of the citizens that live in the city of Richmond. Because the majority of the citizens in the city of Richmond can pay $1.20. Yeah, yeah. The same majority that decided that we didn't need a casino because they didn't want those people to have it.  They can afford $1.20. The same developers that we give a tax break to for developing housing where they are paying the real estate taxes because it's abated now seven years, was 15 years that Mr. Jones speak of, they can afford to pay too. Okay? Vice President. So...  I hear you, Madam Chair. I hear you, Madam Chair. I think that the citizens who hear us tonight need to know that it's not a lack of understanding on behalf of council members as to who can afford to pay and who not. So, Madam Chair, I would ask that the administration work with council immediately  And set a program in place where we reach out to those families that are living in areas where their property, a lady that does my hair sometimes. She's forced out of the community. She lives right near Oak Grove at the elementary school that's closed there. Three bedroom rancher.  She's renting and she's being forced out. This is not just homeowners. These are renters as well. They're being forced out because the owner is selling it for $150,000 to $200,000 because of assessment values. So I'm asking...  We're not going to get this legislation passed anytime soon about giving a break to low-income homeowners until the General Assembly. Someone has already told us today that's going to take two years. For the General Assembly, if they just follow their procedure, okay? So I'm asking that we announce a program that we invite people that are having a hard time paying their real estate taxes.  to come to the city of Richmond and fill out this application, and we will set them on a budget plan that makes it affordable for them to pay their real estate taxes. And we do this. We set up a budget plan. Is that right? Yeah, we set a budget. So let's just set up a budget plan because we're not going to be able to give these folks no relief in two years, okay?  And Ms. Trammell, that reaches the people that needs the help where we can reduce their payments to a payment scale that works for them. Because housing should not cost more than 30% of your income. And so that's what we'll work with. I'm going to support the $1.20 because I know that from my perspective that we cannot afford to not have the revenue that we have at the city level.  And I am going to stand by and fight for the fact that we set up a budget for everyone to make sure that they stay within that 30% of their income for those families that can't afford. And those people that can't afford, I want their $1.20. Thank you.",4441,5204,"""""",Other,Other,0,0

Until we can get to where Vice President Robertson is saying that we can help those that are in need. I still have to deal with the fact that the only way to help those that are in need is to assist everybody. And so I'm going to support  the 113, just on that basic principle right there. Let me say this. Although a stuck dog will holler, this ain't got nothing to do with the administration. It really doesn't. It has everything to do with us. We set the budget. We set the budget up. And they just carry it out. I'm not going to lie. The mayor has done a good job in ensuring that the dollars we've had, that we have had allocated,  That we've done a lot of work in the night. Is it enough? No. Because there's only so many dollars that can go around. And we can't, I can't wait on the next economic development deal. I just can't. Because I don't know if it's going to go through. I don't. I don't know if the Diamond District is going to go through. That the next group will say, if it's, if it's,  I mean, dude, we, you know, if it comes down and council has to vote on it, then the same thing that we saw outside, all the outside pressures that went into every other neighborhood, vote no on this, vote no on this, it's going to descend on us. It's going to descend on us. Don't do it. And we're out of fear of our own positions on council and whether or not we can get a vote again.  We'll sway one way or the other, and I've seen it happen. And so my thing is this. Counsel what we're going to do. What are we going to do? Because, again, we've all heard the same thing, that there are certain communities that have been divested from. We have the receipts for that. And so no one over there adopts the budget. We do. We do.  And the only thing, I'm coming with an amended budget this year that is going to focus on neighborhoods that have been summarily dismissed and or looked over for whatever reason. Whether it's because of not having enough money, whether it's because we wanted to focus somewhere else, it doesn't matter. That's our responsibility, and we have shirked that responsibility my time on council, where we have not been able to come together as  the correct number, whether it's five, six, or whatever we need to amend the budget, to really look at this, and we just have to go with the defaulted budget. And so I'm challenging us. I'm challenging us. And again, I'm not going to lie. I remember the meetings that we had and where I sat, but it changed after Tuesday. It just did. It did. When I saw this city summarily dismiss something  Based on race, I mean, I've never seen anything like that before. Never seen anything like that before. Summarily dismissed on race. Cool. I now know what I'm dealing with. You know, fool me once, shame on me. Fool me twice, shame on you. Not going to happen again. I'm not going to wait to see if the Diamond District goes through before we say this is what we're going to do with dollars and things of that nature. And so, trust me, I'm going to burn the midnight oil, Madam President.  To ensure that the areas of the city that have been summarily dismissed, and again, not because of the intent of our current mayor, because again, he can only do with what he has to do with. You can't. I mean, he's trying to make a dollar out of 15 cents. And he's done a good job. We're going to get some things done with ARPA money, but it shouldn't come to that.  And so, again, before my time off of council, I want folk walking down Hall Street. I want us to bike down Hall. I want to be able to catch at the end of Richmond Highway all the way up a nice, wonderful transit system that it does. 30 minutes is good. If that's all you had to wait was 35 minutes, you're doing well, sir. Because over here, over on our side, oh, you're waiting an hour and a half. And then you got to take an hour and a half just to get. So we need to work on a whole lot of things.  Because if it's bad in one part of this city, hey, it's worse somewhere else. America gets the cold. Black folk get the flu. And so, again, the nine of us have something to say about that. And so the South has got something to say.

He had permit to gut and redo, not demolish and rebuild because you heard in the last meeting, he said, oh, we found bad wood. This is not the first time I've been around building.

You cannot decide to do one thing and then do something else. That's not the way it works. And a variance, and I read in the paper something about he wants to put a kitchen in.  So long, people have been denied in Washington Park to put a second kitchen in their homes. And all of a sudden, we're going to allow a second kitchen? I don't think so. This is just dead wrong.

RCH_11_08_21,SPEAKER_20,"Good afternoon.  Madam President, city council members, the last meeting that you had, I spoke on the same property, 805 Lincoln Avenue, with the situation with the permits. There were permits utilized. The wrong permits were used in the beginning. The house was being built. And later on, things became, you know, one permit was allowed for something. They were inappropriate permits.  But the house was being built all at the same time. And I asked city council to, I would like to see city council to do a depth, in-depth investigation on the permits when I was here. So I want to know the response behind that to see what has happened. The house is up. But still, it was improperly done with the permits. What's supposed to have been in place, demolition or tear down or whatever it is,  It wasn't set like that. It didn't happen like that. And my question to you all, has a proper investigation been done? You know, situations like that with the type of housing coming in that neighborhood, I mentioned also that this is an original African-American community. And it's always been like that. The first Caucasian family moved in in 50 and we became family.  This one married that one, that one married, and we're a community. And really and truly, the neighborhood is probably half of my relatives. Everybody there is some kin to me, but that's the way it is in the African-American community. So with this gentrification coming in, it's making a big difference as to what people are expecting in the community. Things are happening that we're not in agreement.  Got signatures from people that we've walked around, and I understand the owner of the property has gotten signatures too. A lot of things have come out of these signatures from different people. They didn't know what they were signing, some of the elderly in the community, and I think there's a playback on people when you're old and you don't know what you're looking at.  Other situations came about that was stated. Whatever he stated, I wasn't there and I wasn't holding a flashlight, but I went and got signatures myself. And other people have too. As a matter of fact, we have folders with signatures all in there and I'm quite sure he does too. But it's just a situation. If it's allowed with that community and trying to keep it into a certain level,  FOR THE COMMUNITY. THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE WANT. THEY'VE BEEN THERE ALL OF THEIR LIVES. AND THEN BRINGING SOMETHING ELSE IS GOING TO CAUSE OTHER THINGS TO COME IN. NEXT THING YOU KNOW, YOU GOT OLDER PEOPLE THAT'S BEEN THERE FOREVER GOING TO BE MOVED OUT, GENTIFICATION. COUNCILPERSON JONES, TRAMBLE, YOU SAID THAT I'VE HEARD A LOT OF THAT TONIGHT, AND IT'S HAPPENING ALL OVER. BUT THE POINT IS, THE PEOPLE THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE INVOLVED IN HURTING PEOPLE BEHIND THAT, I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH SENIORS.  I love older people.

I feel that approving this permit would detract from the character of the neighborhood, specifically Lincoln Avenue where I live. Washington Park is a neighborhood comprised largely of single family residences. Currently, there is only one other two family dwelling in the neighborhood.  This existing two-family dwelling should be treated as the exception and not the rule. Approving an additional two-family residence will lead to others springing up in the area as Washington Park is currently a targeted area for investors. I strongly oppose the special use permit because it will be a catalyst for an unwelcome change in appearance, makeup of the neighborhood, and will lead to the end of the single-family nature of Washington Park. Excuse me.  Every home on Lincoln Avenue is currently a single family dwelling. Me and two other neighbors canvassed the neighborhood and found 100% opposition to the special use permit. We would like to maintain the current structure of the neighborhood and respectfully ask that council members consider the wishes of residents who have resided in Washington Park for decades and deny the special use permit.

RCH_11_08_21,SPEAKER_16,"Thank you so much. Good evening to the esteemed President, Council, Mrs. Cynthia Newbill. Thank you for the opportunity to speak. I am the President, Washington Park Civic Association.  And I'm representing those residents of the community in a proposition to 801 Lincoln Avenue. As I mentioned, the owner has requested more than one SUP. One has built on another one. I think that there have been several discrepancies made in where one ended and another started.  The last one is this SUP for an accessory dwelling unit within a single-family dwelling upon certain terms and conditions. As my dear friend and resident, proud member of Washington Park said, we are a historical Washington Park African-American community founded in the 1870s at the end of enslavement. We continue to live and to exist  I am a second-generation owner of the same home in this community. If we accept or allow to have this SUP accepted, the residents may drastically have our property taxes altered that may impact us in a very negative manner. I fear that many older residents who are homeowners  may have difficulty dealing with such an increase. Furthermore, our association feels that developers are eagerly waiting for this kind of decision. It can alter the very design of our neighborhood. The architecture structure does not fit the existing homes it could have because there are several different templates that the owner could have chosen.  His design decided to divorce all of the other homes in this neighborhood. So the Washington Park community and our association wishes to keep this a single family dwelling for this community. And we have an active membership of from 32 to 38 persons. We're taxpayers. Some of us are homeowners.  Others of us are residents in the community and may be renters. And as Ms. Janet Copeland and her brother, Mr. Cooper, have spoken, many other neighbors also have spoken with expressing the same opinion. We all except one person in our association are opposed to this additional SUP being allowed. It could change  the complete character of this neighborhood, of this community.

RCH_11_08_21,SPEAKER_00,"Good evening, members of council, Madam President, Madam Vice President. Thank you for the opportunity to speak here tonight. The Washington Park Civic Association's objections to the special use permit stem from one core complaint. The president and several strongly opinionated members are upset that I demolished the existing structure and built another home in its place. To quote the objection letter that the president of the association sent to this council, members comment they like our community the way it is, go and build somewhere else.  He thought we would not object. Would he have done this in another neighborhood? If this is permitted to happen, then others can purchase property, move in, and do the same thing. The original structure had extensive wood rot, termite damage, and a crumbling foundation and proved to be beyond economic repair. It was neglected for over 10 years and rented out unscrupulously.  I maintained the original floor plan of the original structure as well as the classic hip roof and front porch as an homage to the original home. The home has been built by right and conforms to all city size setback and zoning requirements.  However, as the home stands today is not the topic at hand, and I would like to reset the conversation to what this special use permit is actually about. The special use being discussed would allow an existing already built area of the home to be utilized as a small accessory dwelling unit with its own kitchen and a private side entrance that would be nearly invisible from the street. Nothing will change with the size and exterior appearance of the home.  In an effort to gauge how my neighbors feel about accessory dwelling units in the neighborhood, I canvassed door to door and spoke candidly with nearly 80 neighbors about the proposed use. An overwhelming 77% of the persons I spoke with signed a petition with their support, many of whom stating they believe property owners should be able to utilize their properties how they wish and to their fullest potential.  Resetting the conversation to the facts. The facts are Richmond City Code states that special uses may be permitted whenever council finds the use will not be detrimental to the health and safety of the community, create overcrowding, or cause undue strain on city services. The facts are accessory dwelling units are expressly supported and encouraged in the Richmond 300 Master Plan. Accessory dwelling units allow parents to age in place, provide affordable housing in the community,  And allow adult children to live independently in a society where more and more adult children are still living with their parents. The facts are planning and development gave a favorable recommendation to the planning commission for the support of this special use permit. The planning commission agreed with PDR's analysis and voted to recommend approval to council. The director of PDR, Kevin Vonk, is here tonight. I would encourage Madam President to call on Mr. Vonk to provide PDR's perspectives.  I would humbly ask council to look past the not in my backyard arguments and distractions such as the permitting, which are not pertinent to this issue and to make an informed decision based on the facts and the recommendations of the professionals whose roles it is to ensure the health and wellbeing of our city.  To shun change solely on the basis that we don't like change is truly a disservice to all members of our community. We must embrace it to address the challenges we face both today and tomorrow. I hope that council sees the truly benign nature of my request today, and I hope for your vote towards a proposed use that will create affordable housing and many other positives in our community today and years to come.",7084,7275,"""""",Public Hearing,Commenter,0,1

RCH_11_08_21,SPEAKER_30,"Madam President, I come to you as a resident of Washington Park, owner of 816 Akron Street for the concerns of the special use permit for 801 Lincoln.  It's my understanding the neighborhood association has been consulted for input on the approval of the special use. I wanted to bring to you my experience of living in the Washington Park concerning this neighborhood association. Buying this neighborhood was a dream come true for me. My first home on my own, a huge accomplishment coming from a family who never owned a home. And in a great neighborhood that it felt welcoming and safe, but also fell within my budget.  As a new owner of the neighborhood of just over two and a half years prior to this issue, I've heard nothing of the existence of a neighborhood association. No mailings, no invites, no flyers or even street signs, advertising meetings or attendance. As a resident, I've gotten to know my neighbors. I've witnessed family changes for many of them and grown to enjoy the safe feeling of this neighborhood of a welcoming, friendly people.  In my brief research, I found roughly 50 of the approximate 250 homes of our neighborhood have sold in the last three years. To tie this all together, I'm surprised to learn of the secret association which fails to notify the new homeowners of its existence, and I feel it fails to accurately represent the neighborhood which I've grown to love and its newer residents. More so, I'm disappointed to learn of this now and get involved in a negative light with the association.  I ask that you consider those not present, those which have shown in a signed petition that they are not concerned with an additional unit in an existing home, a building type which is shown to benefit families, create responsible residency, and growth for our neighborhood, which has been supported by the staff of Richmond Planning Departments.  I personally have loved the diversity of the structural types within this neighborhood. It is why I decided to purchase this neighborhood. 801 Lincoln Avenue adds to the flavor of this neighborhood. In my opinion, and I believe many of my neighbors likely are not aware of this association, such as myself would agree. Thank you for your time.",7299,7424,"""""",Public Hearing,Commenter,0,1

Accessory dwelling units further create many positives for the community, such as affordable housing in a space where close family members can be near the care of loved ones.

I want to thank all of you who came out to speak on this special use permit tonight and those virtually. To be frank, this SGP has been the most contentious one since I took office. Before I let everyone know my vote on this paper, I want to lay out the facts as it relates to the specific SGP and Mr. Robertson's property in general.  The ordinance would authorize the special use of the property known as 801 Lincoln Avenue for the purpose of an accessory dwelling unit within a single family detached dwelling. Secondly, Mr. Robinson wants to build a second kitchen in the bonus area above his garage. Thirdly, it would add a side door leading to the stairs at the rear of the garage, allowing the space to be used as an in-law suite apartment.  Fourthly, the property is located in the R5 single-family residential zoning district. Accessory dwelling units are not permitted uses in this zoning district. Therefore, a special use permit is required. And finally, through my conversations, it was revealed that contractors were working on Mr. Robertson's home without the proper permits.  Now, while he currently has his paperwork in order, this unauthorized work on his property was a source of tension between him and the Civic Association, and therefore it is a factor in my decision. The city process. With regards to the city's internal SUP process, city planning staff found that this SUP is consistent with the Richmond 300 plan's recommendations  This SUP will not place an undue burden on available parking. This SUP won't be harmful to the general welfare of the community, and it would not create congestion in the streets in the area involved. Based on the staff's recommendation, the planning department recommended that this body adopt this paper. Now I want to move on to what's been done to this point on my end.  First and foremost, at all times and in all instances, I want civic associations to weigh in on SUPs that are in their jurisdiction. So when I heard that the Washington Park Civic Association opposed this SUP, I called a meeting with Mr. Robertson and the Civic Association.  When no compromise could be reached at that meeting, I met with the Civic Association and Mr. Robertson separately. Mr. Robertson subsequently got 60 petitions from his fellow neighbors in support of the SUP and was willing to have another meeting with the Civic Association to try one more time to reach a compromise. The Civic Association opted not to take this meeting.  I also asked supporters and opponents to call or email my office to let me know if they supported this SUP or opposed it. The final tally that is 53 calls or emails against this SUP and six in support of it. Finally, through my liaison, Kaia, I checked in with the planning department director, Kevin Vonk, who is here tonight to see what it would mean for Mr. Robertson if this SUP got denied.  I was informed that he wouldn't be able to rent out the unit. He couldn't do the kitchen unit or the electrical connections to that unit, but he could build a single family house that looks exactly the same. So this brings us to where we are today. I was hopeful that a compromise could have been reached, but that isn't the case.  So this is what I will say. To the Washington Civic Association, I hear your concerns about the changing the character of the neighborhood, the impacts of gentrification, and your fear that the approval of this SUP will lead to other SUPs of this nature. I want you to hear me as well, because this hasn't come up in our meetings. I think an underlying cause of concern is renters moving into the neighborhood.  To that, I say that we have an affordable housing crisis in this city. We need 25,000 units of housing throughout the city if we're going to address that crisis in a substantive way. The master plan is our constitution for land use through 2037. And one of the solutions it recommends is accessory dwelling units.  What that means is that every neighborhood in Richmond has to be welcoming to renters. The average rate of home ownership in this country has been around 65% for decades. So 35% of the people in this country are going to be renters. Some may have vouchers. So if we're going to solve the affordable housing crisis, homeowners are going to have to live together with renters.  Washington Park is a historic African American neighborhood, and we know that African Americans have been discriminated against through unjust practices such as redlining. The question is, are we going to perpetuate discrimination in a new form? Are we going to replace African American victims with victims who are renters of all races?  I say this because this is what's happening in our city. Just last month, Attorney General Mark Herring filed 13 lawsuits against 29 real estate companies in Richmond. The lawsuit alleges that they categorically refuse potential renters who plan to pay using government vouchers.  I want you to know that all of Richmond neighborhoods are going to have to change and be inclusive of renters. There may be an ADU on my block one day, and if we follow the master plan's recommendations, there may come a day when what Mr. Robinson is trying to do to his home through his SUP will be able to be done by right by any property owner in the city.  To Mr. Robinson, thank you for being so patient in this process. You've done everything I've asked you to do.  I know that your SUP is aligned with the master plan, and the planning commission recommended this SUP for approval. But it's city council that decides whether individual SUPs are approved. So given that fact, there is significant opposition from the civic association. There was work on the home previously without the proper permits. And there was more opposition to this SUP than support as measured by the calls and emails to my office.  I'm going to have to vote against this SUP tonight. And I apologize for the time that this has taken, but I just want you to know this is how we have to come together. I was very disappointed to hear that the Civic Association did not want to do another meeting. We're going to have to meet. We're going to have to talk. We're going to have to agree to disagree. And unfortunately tonight, because of overwhelming opposition, I'm going to have to vote against this SUP.  Thank you, Madam President.

RCH_11_08_21,SPEAKER_17,"Thank you, Dr. Newbell. So this paper is pretty straightforward. During the budget process, the council agreed to pay to allocate money for a  pay plan study for fire and police salaries. It was a huge part of our discussion during the budget process. And we know that fire and police want, they have some decompression in their salaries and that they want it to be addressed.  So at the time, we felt like we needed a little more analysis. We funded the study. This paper is to say when that study comes out, Mr. Mayor, please put this in your proposed budget. I think we all know we are losing our frontline workers daily. One officer who worked in my precinct at one point is just fabulous.  I got a notice that he left to go drive Uber. So we know that they're not all leaving because of pay. And all the reasons that folks are leaving, some of them are problems that this body cannot solve. But this is one thing we can do to show that we're supportive, to follow through on the pay plan that we talked about, that we decided to fund.  and to get it in the pipeline for the budget. So I ask you to strongly consider supporting this tonight. I think it would mean a lot to our first responders.

I'm here on behalf of the Richmond Coalition of Police, RCOP. It is the employee association of your Richmond patrol officers with over 350 members. These are the folks who are working the streets for you, okay? Over 200,000 calls for service, second highest in the state of Virginia.  They work hard to keep us safe, citizens and businesses alike. And we're here to support this resolution. And when I say we, I want all of y'all to understand that there are a great many police officers who are watching this and listening to it because, I mean, they're really hanging by a thread on this, okay? Ten, or we just heard just today, another ten are leaving, okay? Eight leaving, two retirements, okay?  We think this paper is significant because it clearly expresses that public safety has got to visibly rise to the top of your budget priorities for next spring. It has to, until we get it right. The citizens need to know, some of y'all know this, but we're supposed to have 756 police officers sworn, okay? 37 positions were frozen. Since June of 2020, about 120 officers  have left or are leaving. You've heard that in here. Another 70 are out on some kind of administrative leave. This does not count the 10 I told you about today. It does not count members who are in drop who could retire at any time, and there's another handful of folks on the chief's desk. That's where we are. You know how broken the pay plan is.  Since 2009, it's been frozen several times, and today the career development program is still not operating, so police officers are frozen, cannot rise in rank, and are frozen at the lowest pay band. Meanwhile, in Chesterfield and in RICO and other agencies, they're filling their ranks for Mars, causing a major manpower and experience drain from the city's police. There is a different...  There's a difference between $44,000, a starting salary here, and $58,000 rookie cop VCU. That's where we are, okay? It's not a good thing from the officer's point of view, and it's a really bad thing from the citizen's point of view. So this is a starting point. We're really grateful for the concern the city council is showing. We're counting on the administration.  to do as the resolution says, and we'll see you in spring. Last point, I know I'm over. We have asked to participate in this study, and we've repeated that request, Madam President, over and again. And I'm not sure whether we will or not, but I think it would be a great idea.

RCH_11_08_21,SPEAKER_04,"Good evening, council members. My name is Brendan Levy, and I am the president of the Richmond Coalition of Police, known as RCOP. I represent the majority of city Richmond police officers, sergeants, and lieutenants. So when I speak, I'm speaking for hundreds of police officers. I'm here today to publicly support Councilwoman Larson's and Trammell's resolution that would recommend appropriation of funds to the human resource pay study when it concludes. The Richmond Police Department is currently in a pay and staffing crisis and having the backing of all city council adopting this resolution,  would be encouraging for the future of public safety. And that is a step in the right direction. We currently have over 110 vacancies. And if you count the officers on administrative leave, we have close to 200 openings throughout the police department. Our officers are overworked and underpaid. There's mandatory overtime all over the city and not enough police officers. And the city administration refuses to even acknowledge there's a serious problem.  We have reached out to the city to be involved with the pay study. They've only responded saying that groups of employees will be involved. They haven't said our cop will be involved. This is concerning that we hope will be resolved quickly. Tonight, I will not go into how angry our members are with the health care increase that is supposed to take effect in January, which basically negates the two steps we received last month.  There's a significant portion of officers that didn't even get the two steps, so they're actually getting a pay decrease with a health insurance spike. More officers are continuing to quit and go to neighboring jurisdictions. Officers who have left haven't lost their passion for policing. They've lost their passion for policing in the city. The two biggest reasons for officers quitting are pay and lack of support.  I know this because I put out multiple surveys in the past year to my members, and that's what the data shows. This resolution will show that city council realizes the seriousness of the problem at hand. This resolution will give officers hope. This resolution might slow the hemorrhaging that is currently going on. And I encourage all council to vote yes this evening to show that they're not turning their backs on public safety.

I am here in my capacity as the President of the Fraternal Order of Police, John Marshall Lodge No. 2, which represents active and retired members of the Richmond Police Department and the Richmond Sheriff's Office.  I wish to express my support for this resolution 2021 R075, which requests in part for Mayor Stoney to ask for the appropriate salary and compensation increases for sworn employees of the police and fire services that may be recommended by a study which was already funded by this body. The substantial loss of police officers and firefighters in the past 18 months due to retirements, resignations, and most notably lateral employment transfers to our neighboring agencies  has left this city in dire need of ways not only to retain our current employees, but also to attract qualified and motivated applicants to join our ranks. I sincerely believe that pay raises, which not only bring us up to the salaries offered by our neighboring jurisdictions, but surpass them and put us in the position of a regional standard bearer, are also necessary to achieve these goals.  Without correcting the significant disparity between us and our neighbors, we slip ever closer to a decline from which it may take a generation to recover. I thank the Council for your support in this matter. I believe that cooperation between the Mayor, the Council, and organizations such as mine and President Levy's from RCOP are necessary for the continued success of this city, its employees, and our residents who rely daily on our emergency services.

President Newbill, Vice President Robinson, honorable members of council, Keith Andes, President Richmond Professional Firefighters Association, IFF Local 995. Our membership supports resolutions 2021-R075 on council's regular agenda this evening.  I would like to take a moment to thank and acknowledge the continuing dedication, passion and professionalism by public safety members on display each and every day to Richmond citizens and visitors. These last couple of years have taken a toll on my brothers and sisters. Continued vacancy rates, safe staffing levels, volunteer and mandatory overtime now being blindsided by substantial increases to health care, freezes to pay steps and career developments have all led to this day.  As of October 28th, 42,154 hours of overtime have been worked by RFD members, adding more stress to our firefighters and their families. RFD has had to cut staffing from four to three members per company on an increasing number of occasions, reassigned 40-hour essential staff to 56-hour workweek to try to make up for the shortfalls.  This resolution if passed will offer hope to a public safety workforce that feels its voices aren't being heard. They are tired and deflated by disappointment of continuing flaws and inequities that reside in this current pay plan.  Tonight, you can start to reinflate the public safety balloon by passing this resolution. Our members are deserving of your support. We wish to thank Councilmember Larson for submitting this resolution, Finance Committee members Robertson, Larson, and Chairman Jones for their vote to send to full council, and we'd also like to thank Councilmember Trammell for signing on as co-patron.

RCH_11_08_21,SPEAKER_07,"Madam President, Lincoln Saunders, Chief Administrative Officer for the city. I would emphatically say yes. When we spoke about the bonuses for  Public safety, as well as our current employees, we spoke to the fact this was in recognition of their service, particularly over the past 18 months, probably beyond that now that we're talking about it again, but in response to COVID-19, civil unrest, et cetera, this was in recognition of past service. The pay study is to make sure that we get the pay plan that works for our public safety departments, particularly our police and fire sworn officers and firefighters,  right for the next year and into the future. This issue is too important to not study and not have the right plan. I respectfully disagree with my friends Bill Pannelly and Keith Andes and some of the framing of the administration's response to the concern. I have Chief Smith here. You all received presentations and conversations from them last week about the issues perhaps two weeks ago now.  both with staffing, recruitment, retention, et cetera. These are issues we are taking very seriously, and we understand the need to show support, but I'm afraid I can't, I could not have supported implementing a pay plan that had not been reviewed for more than a few weeks, even by Mr. Pannelly. We must make sure we do the due diligence on the study, and then therefore,  incorporate those items into the coming budget. That was the commitment the administration made when we requested the study prior to. Just as we advocated for the implementation of the Gallagher study having been conducted, we advocated for the study to ensure that we had the right implementation  For the police and fire plan. For my years as the Mayor's Chief of Staff, the advocacy was to fund the pay plan, to fund the steps that were in the plan that for years hadn't been funded. We had several years in a row of meeting those pay plan and then COVID hit. So when the budget was introduced this year, it included the two steps to make up for the misstep last year as well as the current one.  It was a later addition to the conversation about the study, and it's why Council supported us about the pay plan challenges. That's why the administration requested and Council supported the study. So I guess it's my way of saying I understand and appreciate the intent of the resolution to speak to what Council has already spoken to as far as supporting the study to be conducted.  You know, I would continue to encourage council that budgeting by resolution is probably not our best strategy for planning and effective fiscal management. But, you know, unless the chief has anything particularly he wants to add to the conversation, I would just, you know, caution against the practice, but say that clearly we're going to be working hard to complete the study.  We do intend to invite to the table the members of 995 and RCOP so that the consultants can hear their position and concerns with the existing pay plan. And we look forward to the results of that discussion.

It's another step that shows the support of this council throughout this entire process for our officers and firefighters as well.  It is a good step. I just can't really support some of the questionable facts in which have been presented here. Some of the numbers just really don't add up. I really don't know what resignations that Mr. Penley is saying are sitting on my desk. I was at my desk most of the day today and didn't see those resignations. Ten today, I have not gotten those words. They seem to have more information about the inner workings of the police department than I do.  But it seems as though that the council has continued to show their support of the officers and to clear up some of the facts that are going around. I don't think there was ever anyone's intent to actually supplant the bonus pay for whatever the study shows our pay should be. I think that's always been two separate things. And I think that this council actually saw that. I think exactly what the administration said.  the bonus in just a bonus in order to show our support for them. This pay study has not been completed yet and we're working very diligently. We just submitted a  survey to the company to take a look at to make sure that they can get that out to our officers. So the officers will have the opportunity to actually be able to speak to what they're looking for themselves. I think that's the most important thing. I think we go to all the officers and we ask them what they want, not just their representatives, but we let them speak as well, too. And we look forward to those results coming back and sharing those as well, too. But I support the paper. I just cannot support the logic that they have supported and presented today.",9255,9357,"""""",Other,Other,0,0

I raised the question as it relates to the paper because the study has not been done.  And we don't know what the outcome of the study is going to be. So I would like to respectfully reserve the right to, after reviewing the outcome of the study, if the outcome of the study does not meet what we are hoping to be the outcome, that we will evaluate the outcome based on that.  You know, we're talking about one of the most essential services for the city of Richmond. And as we have spoken earlier today, our communities are not equal. There are communities that have no idea what it's like to have  gunfire through your home, your car being shot up, people being murdered right on the street, right in your neighborhood. I've lived with that for every year that I have lived in the city of Richmond. And  We have some major, major challenges that our police force are dealing with every day. And my hat's off to them because the challenge of the job of working in the city of Richmond is not the same as working in Chesterfield or Henrico. And not every police officer is going to want to work in the city of Richmond for a long period of time.  Some of them don't want anymore to consider working in the city of Richmond. So it takes a special group of guys and ladies to do this work in the city of Richmond. And for too long, they've felt that they weren't honored and respected as they should for a multitude of reasons.  I think we can talk about pay because that's so clear as black and white. You know, I can compare my salary to somebody else's salary. I can compare my benefits to someone else's benefits. What we don't talk about is the difference in the work that we ask our officers to do every day. And not only the work, but the number of hours that they put in, even when we have  not talking about people leaving and talking about shortage and freezes on hiring and those kinds of things. We've always had a challenge with us being able to provide the kind of police department that people  who put on the blue uniform for the city of Richmond feel honored and respected. And that's not everyone that's in the police department. I think many of them take great pride in the work that they're doing, and they also know that we appreciate the work that they're doing.  But I think that we've come to a place with a combination of a lot of things going against us right now. You know, the rioting over the summer, over the last year or so, and the pandemic, the stress of all of those kinds of things. It's not only creating a problem for us with our police department, our firefighters, our ambulance services,  Across the city, we're having a real challenge with workforce everywhere. And it's a very competitive market right now. People can pick and choose what they want and where they want to go. So, you know, I don't know that we will ever always be as competitive with our surrounding counties that are much, much richer than we are and will always be much richer than we are.  But we want to make sure that all of our employees feel they are honored and they are respected and that we provide for them a fair salary.  And fair benefit package. Some of our benefit package, I think, are greater than our surrounding counties, significantly greater. And I think we need to talk about the good things that the city is doing. But we are at a place in time that, you know, the disparity and the lack of equality and the lack of equity in our policies and  and our pay and the number of hours that we ask people to work. Some employees that haven't received a salary increase in years. And when it comes to budget time, it's a tough decision. It's a very, very tough decision. I don't know a budget cycle that I've gone through that I felt like we had $20 million on the table that we could just figure out what we wanted to do with it.  I haven't seen it. And I've seen us fight over a budget for hours and hours and hours and hours and meetings and meetings. And don't make a vote until we have no other choice but to vote. But I agree with my colleagues. I think it's a new day. It has to be a new day in the city of Richmond. Those that have not been fairly invested in,  We're going to make some tough choices and do what we got to do. We do. We just got to do it. Just for the humanity, integrity of this city. Neighborhoods that have been disinvested, we're going to make those changes. And some folk that have been accustomed to getting things, that's not going to happen anymore. And  Police, you are important to us. And I would ask the CAO tomorrow, please make that phone call and let them know how they're going to be included in the process of the study.

They've just recently made their presentation of establishing a board to deal with policing. Tomorrow, invite them to the table. Invite them to the table and let's have a humane conversation.  CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT REALLY IS RIGHT, AND LET'S JUST DO WHAT'S RIGHT. I MEAN, WE ASKED A LOT OF EVERYBODY THAT COMES TO WORK FOR THE CITY. I WORK THIS JOB 24-7, NOT QUITE 24-7, EVERY DAY 24, BECAUSE OTHERWISE I WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO SIT UP HERE, BUT IT'S A SEVEN-DAY JOB. SEVEN DAYS A WEEK I'M ON THE PHONE OR EITHER IN A MEETING RELATED TO THIS JOB FOR $25,000 A YEAR.  No, nothing else. That's it. And I've been doing it for 17 years. And I do it because I choose to. And I know when I walk the streets and knock on doors and ask people to vote for me, I'm going to make $25,000 a year. And that's it.  We make promises to employees that we're going to take care of them. We're going to address cost of livings. We're going to make those things happen. And it is well past time that we take good care of our police department, our fire department, our ambulance service providers, and all of the employees.  of the city of Richmond. And so I'm honored to be a patron of this paper with the understanding that if this study doesn't come back to reflect what it needs to reflect, we're going to do what is right. And that's where I stand as it relates to this study in the paper. Thank you.",9364,9899,"""""",Other,Other,0,0

RCH_11_08_21,SPEAKER_06,"Thank you, Dr. Newbill. I too would like to be added to this paper. I think  It's important that we show our solidarity with the efforts of trying to do what we can to be not only competitive for the pay for our police officers and first responders for keeping our city safe, but more importantly, I think the conversation lends itself to seeing comprehensively. It's not just what you get started to pay at. It's also your promotion ability. It's also what we do for you after you're in our doors working for us.  the benefits, it's retirement benefits, it's healthcare, it's all the things that show that we are putting you first and putting your family first. We've debated the conversations about projects for housing for these people to afford, let alone the salary we're trying to pay them. And so let's really take a big look at what we're trying to really accomplish for our city, because not only is this an important topic for the safety of our city,  But I also know a lot of officers that can't even live in their own city limits because of how our salaries and other impacts hurt and affect their family decisions. So we've gotta make a decision to where we wanna see our city really stand up and be what it can be. And it takes decisions such as pay. It takes other aspects of how we invest in what we are. I want Richmond to be an employer of choice.  And I feel like we've gotten some steps in the right direction, but we've also have issues where we got to catch up and keep up with the surrounding counties, the state, VCU, et cetera. And so I think we've got to definitely put this information in the front seat with what we do, but it seems like we're putting a lot of people in the back, in the front seat, going to this budget. And we haven't even started it yet, really. So I've been interested to see how we can navigate that together, but the study and others like it are important. And I want to make sure we are investing  the money where needed to get the best outcome for the people we hire to keep our city safe and to do the jobs that we depend on for our residents and our neighborhoods.",9905,10022,"""""",Other,Other,0,0

These projects will enhance our transportation infrastructure, improve safety for all roadway users, and are an important part of the city's commitment to Vision Zero.  The enhanced bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure project will be completed as part of the city's paving and resurfacing program by the summer of 2022 on the following corridors. And in the third district is the Brooklyn Parkway from Arthur Ashe Boulevard to Hermitage Road to Brook Road. This project also supports the Better Streets multimodal approach.  FOR MORE INFORMATION, PLEASE, YOU CAN FIND THIS INFORMATION ON THE CITY'S WEBSITE OR YOU CAN CONTACT EMILY DALFINI AT 804-646-0346. ALSO, CITY OFFICES WILL BE CLOSED ON THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 11TH FOR VETERANS DAY AND FOR THANKSGIVING ON THURSDAY AND FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 25TH AND 26TH. ALL LOCATIONS WILL CLOSE AT 5.  And all locations will reopen the following business day at our regularly scheduled time. Last but not least, property tax assessments update. For property owners that disagree with their property tax assessment, there's still an opportunity to file an appeal. To do that, you need to file an appeal with the Board of Equalization and allow the city's assessor's office to make an inspection of the property. The deadline to file an appeal with the BOE is November 30th, 2021.  Again, November 30th, 2021 is the deadline to file an appeal for your property tax assessments.",11621,11887,"""""",Other,Other,0,0

This Thursday, November 11th, is Veterans Day. We honor all who have served in the United States Armed Forces. I extend gratitude for the many sacrifices of our service members, both past and present, that allow us to enjoy the freedoms that we hold so dear. I will be holding a district town hall meeting at the Southside Community Center on November the 18th at 6 o'clock p.m. Masks are required for all those who attend.  The give back, Thanksgiving turkey giveaway will be held on November the 20th at River City Middle School. Drive-thru pickups will be from 12 o'clock p.m. to 3 p.m. My office has received an unprecedented number of requests this year. As of right now, all 1,000 turkeys have been spoken for by seniors and families in need. So many have commented that  It's been so difficult to get turkeys and the fact that we were able to get that number and then to see them go as fast. We've never had them go this fast ever. And so I know there are so many requests that have not been able to be filled. And so we are just scrambling to ensure that we just help those that are in need and try and get as many  families as we can with these 1,000 turkeys as well. We want to thank and give a huge shout out to this year's give back sponsors, Rosie's Gaming Emporium, Feed More, and Gen Care. So we thank, so thankful to them. Thank you for helping make this event a success. If you want to volunteer for the event, please give my office a call and let us know. Again, we're going to get 1,000 folk to and through this line  in about two and a half to three hours, and so we could use all the help that we can get.",12018,12148,"""""",Other,Other,0,0

I also want to thank Ms. Kathy Hughes for giving our 8th District and all of Southside an opportunity for jobs. There is going to be over 1,500 jobs.  There was going to be entertainment. There would be entertainment for everyone. Also, the outdoor concerts on the 55-acre park. There would have been 15 restaurants and a beautiful hotel. And my citizens were saying they would be so proud to put on a uniform or put on a button that said One Casino and Resort.  All the surrounding businesses, even the Call Federal Credit Union, they too would have benefited from one casino and resort. I would like to thank my seven other colleagues who supported this huge development, also the mayor, our CAO, and all of his administration. Also, I'd like to give a special thank you to Mr. Sledge, also to Rick Bishop, all of his help. I don't want to forget our Senator Joe Marcy.  Who was the first one to hold meetings at his Southside office with the many minority contractors in reference to one casino and resort for our 8th district? I want to give a special thank you to the voters of my 8th district. All six of our precincts said yes of 80%. Said yes. Mr. Senator Timmy Kane, you knew that Norfolk, Portsmouth, Danville, and Bristol, and Richmond were given an opportunity  that would have helped the black and brown citizens in these cities. Richmond was the only one who lost a casino. Mr. Senator Timmy Cain, you voted no to the one casino and resort. You said a casino was not a good thing for Richmond.  Don't you represent all Virginians? What makes Richmond different? Is it because you don't know what is best for the poor, black and brown people living in my 8th district? The citizens wanted this one casino and resort for a better life. Mr. Senator Timmy Cain, why not us? Don't we matter?  Remember this. I kept my mouth shut when you ran for Vice President of the United States of America. Mr. Senator Tim McCain, I promise you this. When you run for re-election for Senator, I will not be silenced anymore. You not only hurt me again, but you hurt my citizens in my 8th District. You destroyed their dreams and hope for a better tomorrow. I hope you're finally happy. You haven't won.  This right here is your smoke alarm. If you call 646-1526, these firefighters will come to your house to install this smoke alarm for you for free. It's free. Also, they'll put the batteries in your smoke alarm if you need it. And if you can't get any one, go to the nearest fire station. They will come to your home or to your business and make sure that your smoke alarm is working. You must have a working smoke alarm for it to save your life and your pets and probably their homes next door.  WE'RE GOING TO HAVE AN EIGHTH DISTRICT MEETING NEXT THURSDAY. THIS THURSDAY WE'RE GOING TO HAVE IT TO SECOND THURSDAY BECAUSE I LIKE GOING TO COUNCILMAN MICHAEL JONES' MEETINGS. BUT HE, YOU KNOW, IT'S GOING TO HAVE HIS THIRD THURSDAY, BUT HE'S CHANGED IT BECAUSE THIS THURSDAY IS VETERANS DAY. AND I WANT TO THANK ALL THE VETERANS FOR ALL THEIR SACRIFICES THAT THEY HAVE DONE.  FOR OUR COUNTRY, THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO HAVE FOUGHT AND LOST THEIR LIVES JUST TO PROTECT US. BUT NEXT THURSDAY ON THE 18TH, WE'RE GOING TO BE HOLDING A MEETING AT THE HICKORY HILL COMMUNITY CENTER FROM 6 P.M. TO 7.30. PLEASE WEAR YOUR MASKS. MUST WEAR A MASK. ED JEWITT WILL BE ONE OF OUR SPEAKERS AND ALSO PLEASE SOME FIRE. AND I THINK SOMEONE FROM GEN CARE WILL BE THERE AND SOME OTHER SPEAKERS. SO PLEASE COME TO OUR MEETING  ON THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 18TH FROM 6 PM TO 7 30. I ALSO WOULD LIKE TO THANK COUNCILMAN MICHAEL JONES FOR KEEPING HIS WORD, HIS BOND TO ME IN REFERENCE TO THE TAX REDUCTION FROM $1.20 TO $1.13. I FOUGHT VERY, VERY HARD.  And did a lot of research on that. And as one of my colleagues says, Reva don't put in a whole lot of papers. And when she does, it's very, very, means a lot to her. Something very dear. This paper was, because I knew that it wasn't going to affect the budget. It was going to help the citizens. Especially when I hear them saying that they got taken off tax relief because the mail, and believe me, I know, I'm still getting literature from one casino resort.  ELECTIONS OVER. BUT THAT'S WHY I FOUGHT SO HARD TO REDUCE IT TO $1.13 TO HELP THE POOREST OF THE POOR, NOT ONLY IN MY DISTRICT BUT ALL OVER SOUTH SIDE AND ALL OVER THE CITY OF RICHMOND AS VICE PRESIDENT AND PRESIDENT ELLEN ROBINSON AND PRESIDENT CYNTHIA NEWBELL, THEY KNOW THEY HAVE SOME OF THE POOREST OF THE POOR IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOODS TOO. AND THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN AN OPPORTUNITY TO LET THEM STAY IN THEIR HOMES.  And I've never seen so much development in the past 20 years that I've been on council that we have seen in the past several years and more and more developments coming. But there's not a development that, like the one casino and resort that wasn't going to cost us one dime, not one red penny. They were going to pay for all of it.  And all the meetings that I held with Alfred Liggins and Kathy Hughes, all the meetings they came to, the big event that we held at the satellite outside, the citizens came to hear they had hope, hope and dreams that's been destroyed.  But if you have any questions, you can call my home, 233, oh, let's forget that, 804, 804-233-7382. You must dial 804. Or you can call my personal cell, 804-240-5050.

RCH_12_21_21,SPEAKER_07,"Thank you. Good evening, members of Council, President Newbill, and members of the Government Operations Committee.  In that committee meeting there was discussion about a need for. The public engagement to be at a higher level of for electronic participation of our outside members and. As Miss Larson said, we were going to work with the administration.  One thing I want to emphasize is we had a wonderful meeting with city administration about them being able to assist us. And they sort of pointed out that they have fewer resources than we have. And it was a conversation. And so our staff came back and they have put together what I will put on the screen. I hope that it's gonna click.  Uhm, so this was done completely by the Council staff, Mr. Steve Skinner and Jason Huntley, and with a word or two from me being probably adding more comment than needed. But what it covers and I hope Miss Jordan and Miss Larson and Mr. Jones will agree.  Is initially it was put together to provide source of news and what this one does is talks about the redistricting process, how it started. It provides opportunity for.  Our community members to choose this public process. It covers what Mr. Hebert talked about. Localities in Virginia have two state options for performing the reapportionment of the districts and it invites our members and alerts them that they are going to be included as a part of the process. Gives them background information.  There are three districts with substantial changes, and so here you will see Mr. Hebert talked about this. The ideal number is 25,000.  And so what we've done here is we've included the districts that may receive the substantial impact, and that is the second district, the third district, and the sixth district, as well as the information of how many residents that they currently have. If you click on this picture map,  you will see that it provides a diagram of that district. Now, Council Member Jordan was very adamant about wanting an interactive software, and we are working towards that, and I will show you in the...

RCH_12_21_21,SPEAKER_07,"Just get it back on, sorry. But I will say as a part of that, what they did was they put that information so that you can click on it and the goal is that you would have, is it on? Yes. But that you can click on that so that you can see it. So Ms. Jordan, we are definitely working on something that's far more colorful, far more interactive.  for citizens to participate, then told us as a part of that meeting, different models, we are working on either procuring those, some of them are free and some of them require payment so that we can have all of the features of the particular models that are available.  Mr. Skinner provided this information about the population, the ideal population for voter districts. And that is according to the ninth district, et cetera. And then one of the things that the members of the GovOps committee, our chair directed us to, is to ensure that there would be a place  that our residents could go to offering a chance for public input meetings and a schedule. And that's what you have here as well as this December meeting being held today. Please understand that this would be updated. This is a template, a sort of place now that we're showing you  what could occur and so this public meeting today as regarding the criteria and the schedule as well as proposed dates that will be forthcoming and that information is included in this screen that we're looking at. Now one of the other key points about public input is that  Our community members will be actively solicited and so which may include community meetings as well as surveys by individual Council members. There will be multiple methods of contacting residents and we have placed this language here. That public participation is definitely the intent.  for participation in plan creation for reapportioning and redistricting of the non-local Richmond voter districts. We say non here because it may spill over into another district. It is intended to be fair, inclusive, and equitable and provide opportunity for public input  and additional community opportunity. The dates will be provided as needed. And so just as Councilmember Lambert for the third district might decide a community engagement event, Councilmember Jordan or Robertson, we would have those dates loaded onto this site.  So community solicitation of input will be conducted. This map and this is almost at the end is of all of our districts, but at the bottom of it.  There is a GIS mapping interactive opportunity, and that is what we have available right now. But again, the other software allows you to build it according to neighborhood, but this will allow you to draw, and this is what we have available to us right now, and so the link for it was included as a part of this. I'm scared to touch anything. How do I get out of this thing?  It's out. How do I get out of this?",860,1101,"""""",Other,Other,0,0

My understanding is that this Council wants to be have more public input into the initial creation of a  which is certainly something I favor, frankly. So what I envision happening is that when you meet in early January, that we have some community engagement hearings where people can weigh in. We'll put the map up. We can talk about neighborhoods. And that way, I believe Councilwoman Jordan, you favor discussion ongoing in public rather than  Maps being drawn in secret and then presented to people to say, well, what do you think about this? If at least if we draw a map that reflects some of the public input we're hearing now, we're not going to be able to necessarily to accommodate every single comment, but we should at least listen to that, which we which I know you all intend to do. And then we'll modify the districts according to the public input and your input as well, because ultimately you have the responsibility.
