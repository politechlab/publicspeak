0:21:05,0:22:37,SPEAKER_31,"Okay, thank you. Hi, this is {NAME} calling from {ADDRESS} to ask council to reject {NAME}.  and also the impact of the original bill. It now grants more resources to {NAME} instead of holding them accountable for harming community members. I'd like to read a testimony of {NAME}鈥榮 violence last summer from a person identified as {NAME}. On {DATE}, {NAME} was peacefully protesting in defense of Black Lives at {ADDRESS} when multiple explosives fired by {NAME} discharged in his immediate vicinity. His bicycle was hit, and so was he, receiving two abrasions to his legs. A separate incident on {DATE},  {NAME} was protesting at {ADDRESS}, where a line of riot police was facing off protesters. The officers instructed protesters to stay on the other side of the sidewalk, and {NAME} complied. But suddenly, police rushed at the protesters into the portion of the crosswalk where protesters were standing at police instruction. Multiple officers tackled {NAME}, pinned him to the ground, and punched him. He heard his bicycle helmet crack, and the weight of the officers pinning him made it difficult for him to breathe. The officers finally pulled him to his feet after he exclaimed, I can't breathe.  {NAME} was arrested and told that he hit an officer with his bike and resisted arrest. He was booked, held for about 18 hours, and charged with third-degree assault and failure to disperse. Those charges have since been dropped. As a result of the explosive devices and physical force that {NAME} deployed against him, {NAME} suffered from pain, trauma, and multiple injuries, including a fractured rib, bruised and swollen hip, sprained right thumb, and cuts and bruises over his entire body. Please reject this bill. Thank you.","""""",Public Comment,Commenter

0:31:01,0:32:35,SPEAKER_37,"Good evening, Madam Chair and other council members. I'm {NAME}. I'm the pastor of {NAME} and also a member of the {NAME}.  I too am here to speak on behalf and in favor of the allocation of the $300,000 to start this foundation for the National Slavery Museum. And I'll just be very brief. Two weeks ago, I was in {NAME} and I got to visit the National Civil Rights Museum there. And what is so powerful about that museum, if you've ever been there, is not just the story that it tells about the American Civil Rights Movement, but the place itself. The place itself speaks of so much power because it is literally the place  where one of our greatest leaders of the civil rights movement, {NAME}, was assassinated at the {NAME}. And so people come from all over the world, not just to hear the story and be inspired, but to actually experience the power and the sacredness and the holiness of that particular place and the story of hope and healing that it tells for our nation.  And so I just came away from that experience so excited about the future of the National Slavery Museum here, because there is this massive story to tell, obviously, that is not just the story of {NAME}, but the story of our nation and the legacy of slavery and its ongoing impact. But there is no better place  than the {NAME}. And there is no better place than the city of {NAME} to tell this story and to invite people from all over the world to experience the power, the tragedy, and hope that that story brings. So I'm just so grateful for your support and hope that you'll vote to support that tonight. Thank you so much.","""""",Public Hearing,Commenter
