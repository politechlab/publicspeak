# Processing and Gathering Data from Council Data Project

Some of the data used for annotation comes from [Council Data Project](https://councildataproject.org/). Specifically we used data from Council Data Project's Seattle, Oakland, and Richmond datasets. The scripts in this directory pull down the audio files and metadata from the CDP API to be passed through the rest of the pipeline.
